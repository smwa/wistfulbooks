{"title": "Secret of Charlotte Bront\u00eb", "description": "Twenty years ago, now, I attempted (but was not especially successful in the task) to establish upon the personal knowledge that my own residence as a pupil in the historical Pensionnat in the Rue d'Isabelle, at Bruxelles gave me of the facts of Charlotte Bront\u00eb's relationships to Monsieur and Madame Heger, right impressions about the experiences and emotions she underwent between 1842 and 1846, and that supply the key and clue to the right interpretation of her genius. Every opinion I then ventured to state, not upon the authority of any special power of divination or of psychological insight of my own, but solely upon the authority of this personal knowledge of Monsieur and Madame Heger in my early girlhood, and also of the information I owed to the friendship and kind assistance given me, in my endeavour to rectify false judgments, by the Heger family, has quite recently, not only been confirmed, but established upon entirely incontrovertible evidence, by the generous gift made to English readers throughout the world of the key needed to unlock once and for ever the tragical but romantic 'Secret' of Charlotte Bront\u00eb. - Summary by Frederika MacDonald", "duration": 19692, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "8146", "name": "Frederika Richardson Macdonald"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/the_secret_of_charlotte_bronte_1502_librivox/secret_charlotte_bronte_1502.jpg", "copyright_year": "1914", "genres": ["Biography & Autobiography", "Literary Criticism", "Modern (19th C)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Amy Gramour"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Amy Gramour"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Lucretia B."}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "PART I CHAPTER I THE PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEM OF CHARLOTTE BRONT\u00cb, CREATED BY A FALSE CRITICAL METHOD", "readers": [7240], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_secret_of_charlotte_bronte_1502_librivox/the_secret_of_charlotte_bronte_01_macdonald_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2731}, {"section": 2, "title": "PART I CHAPTER II THE KEY TO THE PROBLEM", "readers": [3657], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_secret_of_charlotte_bronte_1502_librivox/the_secret_of_charlotte_bronte_02_macdonald_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1615}, {"section": 3, "title": "PART I CHAPTER III CHARLOTTE'S LAST YEAR AT BRUXELLES, 1842-43", "readers": [7756], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_secret_of_charlotte_bronte_1502_librivox/the_secret_of_charlotte_bronte_03_macdonald_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1609}, {"section": 4, "title": "PART I CHAPTER IV THE CONFESSION AT STE.
