{"title": "Treatise of the Fear of God", "description": "\u201cThe fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom,\u201d and \u201ca fountain of life\u201d\u2014the foundation on which all wisdom rests, as well as the source from whence it emanates. Upon a principle so vastly important, all the subtle malignity of Satan has been directed, if possible to mislead the very elect; while the ungodly and impenitent fall under his devices. To the mind enlightened by Divine truth, the difference between a filial fear of offending God and the dread of punishment is very plain. Still, by the devil\u2019s sophistry, some of the most pious Christians have been puzzled and bewildered. Bunyan was not ignorant of Satan\u2019s devices, and he has roused the energies of his powerful mind, guided by Divine truth, to render this important doctrine so clear and easy to be understood, that the believer may not err. -
