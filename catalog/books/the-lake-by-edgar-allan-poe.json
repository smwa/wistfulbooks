Best known for his tales of mystery and the macabre, Poe was one of the earliest American practitioners of the short story, and is generally considered the inventor of the detective fiction genre. He is further credited with contributing to the emerging genre of science fiction. He was the first well-known American writer to try to earn a living through writing alone, resulting in a financially difficult life and career.<br /><br />\nPoe and his works influenced literature in the United States and around the world, as well as in specialized fields, such as cosmology and cryptography. Poe and his work appear throughout popular culture in literature, music, films, and television. - Summary by Wikipedia", "duration": 1390, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "21", "name": "Edgar Allan Poe"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/the_lake_1507.poem_librivox/lake_1507.jpg", "copyright_year": "1827", "genres": ["Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "The Lake - Read by BK", "readers": [8786], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/the_lake_1507.poem_librivox/thelake_poe_bk_64kb.mp3", "duration": 98}, {"section": 2, "title": "The Lake - Read by DCC", "readers": [10038], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/the_lake_1507.poem_librivox/thelake_poe_dcc_64kb.mp3", "duration": 93}, {"section": 3, "title": "The Lake - Read by DL", "readers": [2911], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/the_lake_1507.poem_librivox/thelake_poe_dl_64kb.mp3", "duration": 82}, {"section": 4, "title": "The Lake - Read by EL", "readers": [9872], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/the_lake_1507.poem_librivox/thelake_poe_el_64kb.mp3", "duration": 80}, {"section": 5, "title": "The Lake - Read by GG", "readers": [8011], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/the_lake_1507.poem_librivox/thelake_poe_gg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 96}, {"section": 6, "title": "The Lake - Read by JM", "readers": [9902], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/the_lake_1507.poem_librivox/thelake_poe_jm_64kb.mp3", "duration": 78}, {"section": 7, "title": "The Lake - Read by JO", "readers": [10157], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/the_lake_1507.poem_librivox/thelake_poe_jo_64kb.mp3", "duration": 79}, {"section": 8, "title": "The Lake - Read by JSB", "readers": [10123], "path": "https://archive.org/download/the_lake_1507.poem_librivox/thelake_poe_jsb_64kb.mp3", "duration": 86}, {"section": 9, "title": "The Lake - Read by LAH", "readers": [1212], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/the_lake_1507.poem_librivox/thelake_poe_lah_64kb.mp3", "duration": 79}, {"section": 10, "title": "The Lake - Read by LCW", "readers": [8425], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/the_lake_1507.poem_librivox/thelake_poe_lcw_64kb.mp3", "duration": 83}, {"section": 11, "title": "The Lake - Read by LLW", "readers": [4738], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/the_lake_1507.poem_librivox/thelake_poe_llw_64kb.mp3", "duration": 92}, {"section": 12, "title": "The Lake - Read by MAS", "readers": [3645], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/the_lake_1507.poem_librivox/thelake_poe_mas_64kb.mp3", "duration": 94}, {"section": 13, "title": "The Lake - Read by MHA", "readers": [9962], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/the_lake_1507.poem_librivox/thelake_poe_mha_64kb.mp3", "duration": 80}, {"section": 14, "title": "The Lake - Read by MM", "readers": [10147], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/the_lake_1507.poem_librivox/thelake_poe_mm_64kb.mp3", "duration": 90}, {"section": 15, "title": "The Lake - Read by SABT", "readers": [8932], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/the_lake_1507.poem_librivox/thelake_poe_sabt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 81}, {"section": 16, "title": "The Lake - Read by SMR", "readers": [10154], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/the_lake_1507.poem_librivox/thelake_poe_smr_64kb.mp3", "duration": 99}]}
