{"title": "Night The Mountain Fell; The Story Of The Montana-Yellowstone Earthquake", "description": "A severe earthquake, centered in the vacation area of West Yellowstone, Montana, shook the ground and its inhabitants and visitors on August 17, 1959, at 11.37 pm.  A mountainside fell, a lake formed, roads and houses disappeared, people were trapped, people died.  The author of this narrative went to the area the day after the quake, took first-hand stories of the catastrophe, researched in the following months, and wrote this account within a year of the shaking.  The printed source has many informative photographs. - Summary by David Wales", "duration": 6959, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "13338", "name": "Edmund Christopherson"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/the_montana-yellowstone_earthquake_1804_librivox/nightthemountain_1804.jpg", "copyright_year": "1960", "genres": ["Nature", "Technology & Engineering", "Modern (20th C)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "David Wales"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "David Wales"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "DaveC"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "DaveC"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Real Shook; Trapped", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_montana-yellowstone_earthquake_1804_librivox/nightthemountain_01_christopherson_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1960}, {"section": 2, "title": "Outside World; First Patrol", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_montana-yellowstone_earthquake_1804_librivox/nightthemountain_02_christopherson_64kb.mp3", "duration": 871}, {"section": 3, "title": "Civil Defense's Puzzle; Rescue - First Medical Doctor; Civil Defense Wrapup; Untrapped", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_montana-yellowstone_earthquake_1804_librivox/nightthemountain_03_christopherson_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1327}, {"section": 4, "title": "Mystery - Who Got It?; Civil Defense And Natural Disasters; Aftermath", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_montana-yellowstone_earthquake_1804_librivox/nightthemountain_04_christopherson_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1413}, {"section": 5, "title": "Living Geology; Now You Can See It; About The Author", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_montana-yellowstone_earthquake_1804_librivox/nightthemountain_05_christopherson_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1388}]}
