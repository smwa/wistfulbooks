{"title": "At the Sign of the Cat and Racket", "description": "The short novel \u201cAt the Sign of the Cat and Racket\u201d was one of Balzac\u2019s earliest fictions, first published in 1830 and substantially revised in following years. \r\n\r\nThe title (\u201cLa Maison du Chat-qui-pelote\u201d) refers to a sign that hangs over a Parisian fabric shop, depicting a cartoon cat playing racquetball. The business is owned by a family with a narrow view of prim bourgeois propriety. Their complacency is disrupted when a gifted young man of artistic temperament and aristocratic upbringing woos their daughter. What follows is a poignant picture of domestic life and the stress that ensues when different social classes meet and marry. - Summary by Bruce Pirie", "duration": 9965, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "86", "name": "Honor\u00e9 de Balzac"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/atthesignofthecatandracket_2501_librivox/sign_cat_racket_2501.jpg", "copyright_year": "1895", "genres": ["Literary Fiction", "Published 1800 -1900"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Bruce Pirie"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Bruce Pirie"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Barry Eads"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Winnifred Assmann"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Section 1", "readers": [3699], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/atthesignofthecatandracket_2501_librivox/atthesignofthecatandracket_01_balzac_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2420}, {"section": 2, "title": "Section 2", "readers": [3699], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/atthesignofthecatandracket_2501_librivox/atthesignofthecatandracket_02_balzac_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3529}, {"section": 3, "title": "Section 3", "readers": [3699], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/atthesignofthecatandracket_2501_librivox/atthesignofthecatandracket_03_balzac_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2331}, {"section": 4, "title": "Section 4", "readers": [3699], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/atthesignofthecatandracket_2501_librivox/atthesignofthecatandracket_04_balzac_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1685}]}
