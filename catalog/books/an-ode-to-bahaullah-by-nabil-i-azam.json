This was the Weekly Poetry project for February 21st, 2010.<br><br>Mull\u00e1 Muhammad-i-Zarand\u00ed (29 July 1831 \u2013 1892), more commonly known as Nab\u00edl-i-A`zam or Nab\u00edl-i-Zarand\u00ed, was an eminent Bah\u00e1'\u00ed historian during the time of Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h, and one of the nineteen Apostles of Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h. He is most famous for authoring The Dawn-breakers, which stands out as one of the most important and extensive accounts of the ministry of the B\u00e1b. Besides writing a lengthy history of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith, he wrote poetry about the historical events of the religion, which he would send to the Bah\u00e1'\u00eds of Iran. He learned about the B\u00e1b\u00ed Faith at the age of 16 and met Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h in 1851. He made several journeys on behalf of Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h, was imprisoned in Egypt and is the only person known to have made the two pilgrimages to the House of the B\u00e1b in Sh\u00edr\u00e1z and the House of Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h in Baghd\u00e1d in accordance with the rites set out by Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h. After the passing of Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h, and at the request of `Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1, he arranged a Tablet of Visitation from Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h's writings which is now used in the Holy Shrines. Shortly afterwards, overcome with grief, he walked into the sea and drowned.
