{"title": "Oedipus", "description": "Oedipus is a Latin verse tragedy written by the Roman playwright Seneca the Younger. It is based on the Greek legend of Oedipus and his marriage to his mother Jocasta.\r\n<BR><BR>\r\nAn oracle once came to Laius, king of Thebes, that he should perish by his own son's hands. When, therefore, a son was born to him, he gave the infant to his chief of shepherds to expose on Mount Cithaeron. But the tender-hearted rustic gave the babe instead to a wandering herdsman of Polybus, the king of Corinth.\r\n<BR><BR>\r\nYears later, a reputed son of Polybus, Oedipus by name, fearing an oracle which doomed him to slay his father and wed his mother, fled from Corinth, that so he might escape this dreadful fate. As he fared northward, he met and slew an old man who imperiously disputed the narrow way with him. Upon arriving at the Theban land, he read the riddle of the Sphinx, and so destroyed that monster which Juno had sent to harass the land which she hated; and for this service, Oedipus was made the husband of Jocasta, the widowed queen of Laius (who had recently been slain upon the road), and set upon the vacant throne.\r\n<BR><BR>\r\nNow other years have passed, and sons and daughters have been born to the royal pair. But now a dreadful pestilence afflicts the state. Oedipus has sent Creon to consult the oracle, to learn the cause and seek the means of deliverance from the scourge. And while he waits his messenger's return, the murky dawn still finds him grieving for his kingdom's wretched plight. - Summary by Alan Mapstone\r\n<BR><BR>Cast List<BR><BR>\r\nOedipus, King of Thebes: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/8011\">Greg Giordano</a><BR>\r\nJocasta, his wife: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/18543\">Agnes Robert Behr</a><BR>\r\nCreon, her brother: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/6754\">ToddHW</a><BR>\r\nTiresias, a blind prophet: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/8425\">Larry Wilson</a><BR>\r\nManto, his daughter: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/19030\">LuMiness</a><BR>\r\nOld Man: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/7170\">Alan Mapstone</a><BR>\r\nPhorbus, a shepherd: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/17662\">Inkell</a><BR>\r\nMessenger: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/12623\">Stefan Von Blon</a><BR>\r\nChorus of Theban elders: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/16764\">dc</a><BR>\r\nChorus of Theban elders: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/7170\">Alan Mapstone</a><BR>\r\nNarration: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/17576\">Beeswaxcandle</a><BR>\r\nAudio Editor: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/7170\">Alan Mapstone</a><BR>", "duration": 5513, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "257", "name": "Lucius Annaeus Seneca"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/oedipus_2403_librivox/oedipus_2403.jpg", "copyright_year": "1907", "genres": ["Tragedy"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Alan Mapstone"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "ToddHW"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Alan Mapstone"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Introduction and Dramatis Personae", "readers": [7170], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/oedipus_2403_librivox/oedipus_0_seneca_64kb.mp3", "duration": 273}, {"section": 1, "title": "Act 1", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/oedipus_2403_librivox/oedipus_1_seneca_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1033}, {"section": 2, "title": "Act 2", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/oedipus_2403_librivox/oedipus_2_seneca_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1348}, {"section": 3, "title": "Act 3", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/oedipus_2403_librivox/oedipus_3_seneca_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1221}, {"section": 4, "title": "Act 4", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/oedipus_2403_librivox/oedipus_4_seneca_64kb.mp3", "duration": 743}, {"section": 5, "title": "Act 5", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/oedipus_2403_librivox/oedipus_5_seneca_64kb.mp3", "duration": 895}]}
