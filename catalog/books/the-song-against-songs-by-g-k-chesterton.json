{"title": "Song Against Songs", "description": "LibriVox volunteers bring you 9 recordings of The Song Against Songs by G. K. Chesterton. This was the Fortnightly Poetry project for October 16, 2011.<br><br>Chesterton was a large man, standing 6 feet 4 inches (1.93 m) and weighing around 21 stone (130 kg; 290 lb). His girth gave rise to a famous anecdote. During World War I a lady in London asked why he was not 'out at the Front'; he replied, 'If you go round to the side, you will see that I am.' On another occasion he remarked to his friend George Bernard Shaw: \"To look at you, anyone would think a famine had struck England\". Shaw retorted, \"To look at you, anyone would think you have caused it\". P. G. Wodehouse once described a very loud crash as \"a sound like Chesterton falling onto a sheet of tin.\"( Summary from Wikipedia )", "duration": 1039, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "426", "name": "G.
