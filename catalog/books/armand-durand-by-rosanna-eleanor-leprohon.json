{"title": "Armand Durand", "description": "Armand Durand, published in 1868, was written by Rosanna Leprohon, an English-speaker with an insider\u2019s knowledge of French Canada, thanks to her Montreal education and marriage to a man from an old Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois family.<br><br>\nPaul Durand, a prosperous Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois farmer, marries in quick succession two very different wives, and fathers two very different sons. The first son, Armand, delicate and bookish, is destined for a legal career in the city; the second, Paul Junior, tougher and down-to-earth, continues life on the farm. The story deals with troubling aspects of parental, sibling, and marital relationships.<br><br>\nArmand Durand\u00a0may be one of the best Canadian novels that no one has heard of. It was well received in both its English and French editions, but is today hard to find, especially in the original English.\u00a0Silenced Sextet\u00a0(1993), a study of 19th-century Canadian women authors whose works were initially popular but later slipped into obscurity, offers this assessment: \u201cit is a mature novel, valuable for its complex human relationships and also for its glimpses of Montreal life in Leprohon\u2019s own time and of rural Quebec life in somewhat earlier days.\u201d - Summary by Bruce Pirie", "duration": 27718, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "9920", "name": "Rosanna Eleanor Leprohon"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/armanddurand_1706_librivox/armand_1706.jpg", "copyright_year": "1868", "genres": ["Family Life", "Literary Fiction"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Bruce Pirie"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Bruce Pirie"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Sarah Jennings"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "DaveC"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Chapter I", "readers": [3699], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/armanddurand_1706_librivox/armanddurand_01_leprohon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1177}, {"section": 2, "title": "Chapter II", "readers": [3699], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/armanddurand_1706_librivox/armanddurand_02_leprohon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1420}, {"section": 3, "title": "Chapter III", "readers": [3699], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/armanddurand_1706_librivox/armanddurand_03_leprohon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1325}, {"section": 4, "title": "Chapter IV", "readers": [3699], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/armanddurand_1706_librivox/armanddurand_04_leprohon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1458}, {"section": 5, "title": "Chapter V", "readers": [3699], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/armanddurand_1706_librivox/armanddurand_05_leprohon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1056}, {"section": 6, "title": "Chapter VI", "readers": [3699], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/armanddurand_1706_librivox/armanddurand_06_leprohon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2537}, {"section": 7, "title": "Chapter VII", "readers": [3699], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/armanddurand_1706_librivox/armanddurand_07_leprohon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1019}, {"section": 8, "title": "Chapter VIII", "readers": [3699], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/armanddurand_1706_librivox/armanddurand_08_leprohon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1056}, {"section": 9, "title": "Chapter IX", "readers": [3699], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/armanddurand_1706_librivox/armanddurand_09_leprohon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1291}, {"section": 10, "title": "Chapter X", "readers": [3699], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/armanddurand_1706_librivox/armanddurand_10_leprohon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1089}, {"section": 11, "title": "Chapter XI", "readers": [3699], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/armanddurand_1706_librivox/armanddurand_11_leprohon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1228}, {"section": 12, "title": "Chapter XII", "readers": [3699], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/armanddurand_1706_librivox/armanddurand_12_leprohon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2384}, {"section": 13, "title": "Chapter XIII", "readers": [3699], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/armanddurand_1706_librivox/armanddurand_13_leprohon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 822}, {"section": 14, "title": "Chapter XIV", "readers": [3699], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/armanddurand_1706_librivox/armanddurand_14_leprohon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1965}, {"section": 15, "title": "Chapter XV", "readers": [3699], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/armanddurand_1706_librivox/armanddurand_15_leprohon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1458}, {"section": 16, "title": "Chapter XVI", "readers": [3699], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/armanddurand_1706_librivox/armanddurand_16_leprohon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1885}, {"section": 17, "title": "Chapter XVII", "readers": [3699], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/armanddurand_1706_librivox/armanddurand_17_leprohon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2177}, {"section": 18, "title": "Chapter XVIII", "readers": [3699], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/armanddurand_1706_librivox/armanddurand_18_leprohon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1112}, {"section": 19, "title": "Chapter XIX", "readers": [3699], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/armanddurand_1706_librivox/armanddurand_19_leprohon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1259}]}
