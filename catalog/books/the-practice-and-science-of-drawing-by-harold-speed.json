{"title": "Practice and Science of Drawing", "description": "This book is an attempt to teach beginning students how to draw. Starting out with intuition and vision, Harold Speed explains line and mass drawing, and how rhythm is conveyed in art by means of balance and proportion. Everything is pulled together in a chapter on portrait drawing, before the author gives hints on materials and procedure. This manual was written in 1913, but because of the intelligent combination of useful advice and sensitive reflection on the nature and meaning of artistic practice, it has been considered a valuable resource for artists.
