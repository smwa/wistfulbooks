{"title": "Lord Clive", "description": "Robert Clive was, in Macaulay\u2019s view, the real founder of British power in India. Macaulay himself served on the Governor\u2019s Council in India from 1834 to 1838, working on legal and educational changes in that country. In his view, the establishment of British control and influence in India was part of a great civilizing mission, helping to rid India of its backwardness, superstitions, and corruption by replacing them with an advanced English culture, scientific and literary. That view comes through very clearly both in this essay and that of his on Warren Hastings as well. Needless to say many Indians have and have had a rather different outlook.
