{"title": "Traveller\u2019s Narrative Written to Illustrate the Episode of the B\u00e1b", "description": "\u201cThis book is the history of a proscribed and persecuted sect written by one of themselves,\u201d writes Professor Edward Granville Browne, the Cambridge Orientalist who translated this narrative. \u201cAfter suffering in silence for nigh upon half a century, they at length find voice to tell their tale and offer their apology. Of this voice I am the interpreter.\u201d This work is the story of the life of the Siyyid \u2018Al\u00ed-Muhammad-i-Sh\u00edr\u00e1z\u00ed (1819-1850), known as the \u201cB\u00e1b\u201d, which is Arabic for \u201cGate\u201d. He claimed to be none other than the Promised One of Isl\u00e1m and a new Manifestation of God. He also proclaimed that He was the Gate, Herald and Forerunner of an even greater Manifestation of God who would come soon after Him, the Promised One of all religions and Return of Christ in the Glory of the Father, M\u00edrz\u00e1 Husayn-\u2018Al\u00ed-yi-N\u00far\u00ed (1817-1892), known as Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h (Arabic for \u201cThe Glory of God\u201d). The followers of the B\u00e1b were known as B\u00e1b\u00eds. When Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h declared His mission in 1863, most B\u00e1b\u00eds accepted Him as the Manifestation foretold by the B\u00e1b. Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h\u2019s followers then became known as Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00eds. This book also describes Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h\u2019s exile and His teachings. Edward G. Browne continued to refer to Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00eds as B\u00e1b\u00eds, but this isn\u2019t quite correct, as the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed Faith represents a new religious dispensation and is now recognised as the second most widespread religion on the planet and most recent of the great world religions. This narrative was composed by \u2018Abb\u00e1s Effend\u00ed (1844-1921), also known as \u2018Abdu\u2019l-Bah\u00e1 (Arabic for \u201cServant of the Glory\u201d). He was the eldest son of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h and leader of the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed Faith after Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h\u2019s passing. Browne, who met the Author in Palestine, writes (p. xxxvi.) that \u2018Abdu\u2019l-Bah\u00e1 was \u201ca tall strongly-built man holding himself straight as an arrow, with white turban and raiment, long black locks reaching almost to the shoulder, broad powerful forehead indicating a strong intellect combined with an unswerving will, eyes keen as a hawk's, and strongly-marked but pleasing features\u2026 One more eloquent of speech, more ready of argument, more apt of illustration, more intimately acquainted with the sacred books of the Jews, the Christians, and the Muhammadans, could, I should think, scarcely be found even amongst the eloquent, ready, and subtle race to which he belongs\u201d.<br> \n<br>\nNOTE: I have decided not to read the whole introduction by E.G. Browne. Instead, I have recorded just the first three pages thereof (pp. vii. \u2013 ix.), which give a brief explanation of the work. While the introduction is very interesting, it is also very long, constituting a narrative in itself, and may distract the reader from \u2018Abdu\u2019l-Bah\u00e1\u2019s story. The remainder of the introduction contains a lot of useful information, including Browne\u2019s account of how he became interested in the B\u00e1b\u00ed and Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed Faiths (pp. ix. \u2013 xx.) and his famous verbal portrait of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h (pp. xxxix. \u2013 xl.). The entire introduction could be read as part of a short works collection. I have also omitted most of E.G. Browne\u2019s footnotes, which often contain long quotations in Arabic or Persian or otherwise distract the reader from the narrative. Likewise, the long notes at the end of the book have been omitted.\u201d<br>\n\n(Summary by Nicholas James Bridgewater)", "duration": 18072, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "1310", "name": "Abdu\u2019l-Bah\u00e1 \u2018Abb\u00e1s"}], "coverArt": "http://archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt23/travellers_narrative_1210.jpg", "copyright_year": "1891", "genres": ["Other religions"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Nicholas James Bridgewater"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Nicholas James Bridgewater"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Nicholas James Bridgewater"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "mim@can (1949-2017)"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "00 -
