{"title": "\"Mind The Paint\" Girl", "description": "\"The \"Mind The Paint\" Girl, by Louis Tracy, is a delightful novelization of Sir Arthur Pinero's sparkling comedy now having a successful New York run.... Mr. Tracy has caught the very spirit of the drama and has told its story with much of the same vivre that has packed the theatre and made it impossible to get seats except several weeks in advance. It is the story of the meteoric rise of a lovely young musical comedy actress whose song \"Mind the Paint\" put London at her feet and the opportunity of placing several British coronets on her head.\"  Note that we also have the play itself available here at Librivox. - Summary by Bookseller Magazine of 1912", "duration": 25416, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "2107", "name": "Louis Tracy"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/mindthepaintgirl_2007_librivox/mind_the_paint_girl_2007.jpg", "copyright_year": "1912", "genres": ["General Fiction"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "ToddHW"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "ToddHW"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Stav Nisser"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "A May Morning", "readers": [13577], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/mindthepaintgirl_2007_librivox/mindthepaint_01_tracy_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1487}, {"section": 2, "title": "The New Star", "readers": [13577], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/mindthepaintgirl_2007_librivox/mindthepaint_02_tracy_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1512}, {"section": 3, "title": "Vertigo", "readers": [13577], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/mindthepaintgirl_2007_librivox/mindthepaint_03_tracy_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1545}, {"section": 4, "title": "The Descent", "readers": [14121], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/mindthepaintgirl_2007_librivox/mindthepaint_04_tracy_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1494}, {"section": 5, "title": "In The Depths", "readers": [13075], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/mindthepaintgirl_2007_librivox/mindthepaint_05_tracy_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1416}, {"section": 6, "title": "The Plot", "readers": [13075], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/mindthepaintgirl_2007_librivox/mindthepaint_06_tracy_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1887}, {"section": 7, "title": "An Interlude", "readers": [13075], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/mindthepaintgirl_2007_librivox/mindthepaint_07_tracy_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1345}, {"section": 8, "title": "Harmonies, and Some Discords", "readers": [13075], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/mindthepaintgirl_2007_librivox/mindthepaint_08_tracy_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1774}, {"section": 9, "title": "Frivolities", "readers": [14141], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/mindthepaintgirl_2007_librivox/mindthepaint_09_tracy_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1972}, {"section": 10, "title": "Some Minor Issues", "readers": [14480], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/mindthepaintgirl_2007_librivox/mindthepaint_10_tracy_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1480}, {"section": 11, "title": "The End of the Frolic", "readers": [10261], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/mindthepaintgirl_2007_librivox/mindthepaint_11_tracy_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1386}, {"section": 12, "title": "Smoldering Ashes", "readers": [10261], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/mindthepaintgirl_2007_librivox/mindthepaint_12_tracy_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1449}, {"section": 13, "title": "Which Begin to Glow", "readers": [10261], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/mindthepaintgirl_2007_librivox/mindthepaint_13_tracy_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1645}, {"section": 14, "title": "And Ultimately Burst into Flame", "readers": [8591], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/mindthepaintgirl_2007_librivox/mindthepaint_14_tracy_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1740}, {"section": 15, "title": "The Morning After", "readers": [12029], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/mindthepaintgirl_2007_librivox/mindthepaint_15_tracy_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1516}, {"section": 16, "title": "The Settlement", "readers": [8591], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/mindthepaintgirl_2007_librivox/mindthepaint_16_tracy_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1768}]}
