{"title": "Sketches New and Old", "description": "This collection of 63 writings by Mark Twain was published in 1875. Among other sketches, it contains \"The Jumping Frog\" in the original English, followed by a French translation (read here by Caroline Mittler) which Twain re-translated into English, showing how the French translation of his work was \"badly flawed.\" In many of these sketches, Twain shows his talent for outrageous and hilarious inventiveness, often in reaction to current events.
