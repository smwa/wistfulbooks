{"title": "Privilege of Pain", "description": "We have seen that as mankind rises in the scale of civilization the body becomes increasingly less important. Nevertheless, I wish it to be clearly understood, that I do not maintain that it is preferable to be ill than well, but only that each state has its own peculiar privileges, which are rarely interchangeable.\n\nHealth and sickness are merely different roads to achievement. The earth requires rain as well as sunshine; we need both tears and laughter; navvies are necessary and so are philosophers.\nThe book details how people from many professions who had some or other physical disability or pain reached their goals. The introduction is by Kate Douglas Wiggin. \n - Summary by Stav Nisser and the conclusion of the book.", "duration": 7801, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "13944", "name": "Caroline Kane Mills Everett"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/privilege_of_pain_1907_librivox/privilegeofpain_1907.jpg", "copyright_year": "1920", "genres": ["Health & Fitness", "Philosophy"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Stav Nisser"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Lynne T"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "afutterer"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Introduction", "readers": [6281], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/privilege_of_pain_1907_librivox/privilegeofpain_00_everett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 0}, {"section": 1, "title": "Health And Strength", "readers": [13188], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/privilege_of_pain_1907_librivox/privilegeofpain_01_everett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 0}, {"section": 2, "title": "Soldiers and a Sailor", "readers": [13188], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/privilege_of_pain_1907_librivox/privilegeofpain_02_everett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 0}, {"section": 3, "title": "Ill-Health and its Relation to Genius", "readers": [13188], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/privilege_of_pain_1907_librivox/privilegeofpain_03_everett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 0}, {"section": 4, "title": "Among the Poets", "readers": [10801], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/privilege_of_pain_1907_librivox/privilegeofpain_04_everett_128.kb.mp3_64kb.mp3", "duration": 0}, {"section": 5, "title": "Novelists", "readers": [10801], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/privilege_of_pain_1907_librivox/privilegeofpain_05_everett_128.kb.mp3_64kb.mp3", "duration": 0}, {"section": 6, "title": "Physical Perfection and its Relation to Civilization", "readers": [6836], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/privilege_of_pain_1907_librivox/privilegeofpain_06_everett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 0}, {"section": 7, "title": "The Physically Handicapped Philosophers", "readers": [11049], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/privilege_of_pain_1907_librivox/privilegeofpain_07_everett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 0}, {"section": 8, "title": "Astronomers and Mathematicians", "readers": [6836], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/privilege_of_pain_1907_librivox/privilegeofpain_08_everett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 0}, {"section": 9, "title": "Statesmen and Politicians", "readers": [6836], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/privilege_of_pain_1907_librivox/privilegeofpain_09_everett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 0}, {"section": 10, "title": "The Freedom of Ill-Health", "readers": [8576], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/privilege_of_pain_1907_librivox/privilegeofpain_10_everett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 0}, {"section": 11, "title": "Artists; Musicians", "readers": [11953], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/privilege_of_pain_1907_librivox/privilegeofpain_11_everett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 0}, {"section": 12, "title": "Three Physicians, a Naturalist and a Chemist; Inventors", "readers": [11049], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/privilege_of_pain_1907_librivox/privilegeofpain_12_everett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 0}, {"section": 13, "title": "Historians and Men of Letters", "readers": [11049], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/privilege_of_pain_1907_librivox/privilegeofpain_13_everett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 0}, {"section": 14, "title": "Protestant Reformers", "readers": [13199], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/privilege_of_pain_1907_librivox/privilegeofpain_14_everett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 0}, {"section": 15, "title": "The Saints", "readers": [6836], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/privilege_of_pain_1907_librivox/privilegeofpain_15_everett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 0}, {"section": 16, "title": "Pain, the Great Teacher; Conclusion", "readers": [6281], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/privilege_of_pain_1907_librivox/privilegeofpain_16_everett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 0}]}
