{"title": "Christmas Tales Of Flanders", "description": "\u201cThe Christmas Tales Of Flanders presented in this volume are popular fables and legends current in Flanders and Brabant, which have for centuries been told to children throughout Belgium. Their origin is doubtful, as all literature handed down by oral tradition must be. A good many of these stories are found in a different guise in the legends of other nations\u2026.  These tales occupy for the Flemish the place nursery rhymes take in England\u2026\u201d  (Introduction)  The book title may be a bit misleading as the stories, with two exceptions, do not concern themselves with Christmas.  Perhaps a way to think about this is that they are good stories to tell around a roaring yule fire. - Summary by Book Introduction and David Wales", "duration": 9532, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "15957", "name": "Andre de Ridder"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/christmas_tales_of_flanders_2103_librivox/christmastalesflanders_2102.jpg", "copyright_year": "1917", "genres": ["Myths", "Legends & Fairy Tales", "Myths", "Legends & Fairy Tales"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "David Wales"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "David Wales"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "DaveC"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "DaveC"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Introduction", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/christmas_tales_of_flanders_2103_librivox/christmastalesflanders_00_deridder_64kb.mp3", "duration": 141}, {"section": 1, "title": "The Rich Woman And The Poor Woman; The Story of Seppy", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/christmas_tales_of_flanders_2103_librivox/christmastalesflanders_01_deridder_64kb.mp3", "duration": 758}, {"section": 2, "title": "The Enchanted Apple-Tree; The Convent Free From Care", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/christmas_tales_of_flanders_2103_librivox/christmastalesflanders_02_deridder_64kb.mp3", "duration": 480}, {"section": 3, "title": "The Witches\u2019 Cellar; The Boy Who Always Said The Wrong Thing", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/christmas_tales_of_flanders_2103_librivox/christmastalesflanders_03_deridder_64kb.mp3", "duration": 471}, {"section": 4, "title": "Hop-o-My-Thumb; The Emperor\u2019s Parrot", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/christmas_tales_of_flanders_2103_librivox/christmastalesflanders_04_deridder_64kb.mp3", "duration": 775}, {"section": 5, "title": "The Little Blacksmith Verholen; Balten And The Wolf", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/christmas_tales_of_flanders_2103_librivox/christmastalesflanders_05_deridder_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1845}, {"section": 6, "title": "The Mermaid; The Story Of The Little Hal-Cock", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/christmas_tales_of_flanders_2103_librivox/christmastalesflanders_06_deridder_64kb.mp3", "duration": 649}, {"section": 7, "title": "The Dwarf And The Blacksmith; Percy The Wizard Nicknamed Snail", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/christmas_tales_of_flanders_2103_librivox/christmastalesflanders_07_deridder_64kb.mp3", "duration": 807}, {"section": 8, "title": "Simple John; The Two Chickens Or The Two ears", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/christmas_tales_of_flanders_2103_librivox/christmastalesflanders_08_deridder_64kb.mp3", "duration": 536}, {"section": 9, "title": "The Wonderful Fish; The Frying-Pan", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/christmas_tales_of_flanders_2103_librivox/christmastalesflanders_09_deridder_64kb.mp3", "duration": 839}, {"section": 10, "title": "Farmer Broom Farmer Leaves And Farmer Iron; Little Lodewyk And Annie The Witch", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/christmas_tales_of_flanders_2103_librivox/christmastalesflanders_10_deridder_64kb.mp3", "duration": 481}, {"section": 11, "title": "The Giant Of The Causeway; The Key-Flower; The Ogre", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/christmas_tales_of_flanders_2103_librivox/christmastalesflanders_11_deridder_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1750}]}
