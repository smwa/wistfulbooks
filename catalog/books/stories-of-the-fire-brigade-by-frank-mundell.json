{"title": "Stories of the Fire Brigade", "description": "The stories presented here have been collected from reports of actual incidents responded to by various fire brigades with examples from both Great Britain and the United States of America. \r\nThe author gives some background on the earliest systematic procedures and laws introduced to preserve life and property from uncontrolled fire, which in Britain can be dated back to pre-Saxon times but even these basic procedures are pre-dated by systems and equipment developed in even earlier times by the Chinese, the Greeks and the Romans.\r\nThe stories give the reader (& listener) a real appreciation of the diverse and complex emergency situations confronted by those responding to an outbreak of fire. And they further describe the bravery, resilience and ingenuity shown by the firemen who put their own lives on the line when called upon to save the lives of those caught up in a desperate peril. \r\nStories of the Fire Brigade was one in a series of inspirational texts and \u2018heroic writings of daring deeds\u2019 by the Victorian author Frank Mundell and published by The Sunday School Union. \r\nFrank Mundell wrote a significant number of books for children (both boys and girls) and young adults and many of these were distributed and presented to them through their Sunday schools. - Summary by Steve C", "duration": 12937, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "12713", "name": "Frank Mundell"}], "coverArt": null, "copyright_year": "1899", "genres": ["Children's Non-fiction"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Steve C"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Steve C"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "DaveC"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "DaveC"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Front Matter - Preface & Epigraph", "readers": [7389], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/stories_of_the_fire_brigade_2312_librivox/storiesfirebrigade_00_mundell_64kb.mp3", "duration": 153}, {"section": 1, "title": "Chapter 1: The Fire Brigade", "readers": [7389], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/stories_of_the_fire_brigade_2312_librivox/storiesfirebrigade_01_mundell_64kb.mp3", "duration": 883}, {"section": 2, "title": "Chpts 2 & 3: Fire Engines & The London Fire Brigade", "readers": [7389], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/stories_of_the_fire_brigade_2312_librivox/storiesfirebrigade_02_mundell_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1318}, {"section": 3, "title": "Chpts 4 & 5: Through The Flames & A Great Fireman", "readers": [7389], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/stories_of_the_fire_brigade_2312_librivox/storiesfirebrigade_03_mundell_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1594}, {"section": 4, "title": "Chpts 6 & 7: Whitechapel Hero & Heroic Alice Ayres", "readers": [7389], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/stories_of_the_fire_brigade_2312_librivox/storiesfirebrigade_04_mundell_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1063}, {"section": 5, "title": "Chpts 8 ~ 10: Eng.
