{"title": "My Discovery of England", "description": "\"In the course of time a very considerable public feeling was aroused in the United States and Canada over this state of affairs. The lack of reciprocity in it seemed unfair. It was felt (or at least I felt) that the time had come when some one ought to go over and take some impressions off England. The choice of such a person (my choice) fell upon myself. By an arrangement with the Geographical Society of America, acting in conjunction with the Royal Geographical Society of England (to both of whom I communicated my proposal), I went at my own expense.\"<br/><br/>\n\nAnd from thence follow the impressions of Canadian political economist and humourist, Stephen Leacock, after a lecturing visit to England.
