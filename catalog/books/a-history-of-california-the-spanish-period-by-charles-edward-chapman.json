{"title": "History of California: The Spanish Period", "description": "If you have ever wondered why Spain (and not Japan, which was so so much better positioned to do it) was first to \u201csettle\u201d the Golden State, this book is for you. Professor Chapman has produced a comprehensive and highly entertaining popular history of \u201cthe Californias,\u201d beginning with a nod to geography and the native races and carrying on through to the arrival of Old Glory in 1848.\nWhat might in less capable hands have proved a heavy historical loaf to digest is lightened and leavened with the yeast of \u201cinteresting incident\u201d throughout. Consider the plight of the newly-appointed Governor of Alta California, Pedro Fages, whose own wife, the fiery Catalan Do\u00f1a Eulalia Callis, who, when she wasn't giving away to the \u201cnaked indians\u201d all of her own clothes (and the Governor's, too) secretly petitioned the authorities in Mexico for his removal from office. The author relates at some length the romantic story of beautiful Concepti\u00f3n Arg\u00fcello, who chose to wait faithfully all her life for the return of the rascally Raz\u00e1nov the Russian, with whom she had fallen in love. The tragic conclusion of this affair is touchingly imagined in an extended quote from the famous poem by Bret Harte.(1)\nBut not all is frivolity. The historical meat is here as well, in breadth and in detail. The author's stated purpose is \u201cto show that California history is important as well as interesting,\u2014that the great Anza expedition of 1775-1776 and the Yuma massacre of 1781 demand inclusion in any comprehensive history of the United States,\u2014that California, while it indeed has a romantic history to tell, has also a great deal more than that to contribute to the cherished traditions of the American people.\u201d (Preface)\n(1) Concepti\u00f3n de Arg\u00fcello. by Bret Harte, Presidio de San Francisco, 1800.\n- Summary by Steven Seitel", "duration": 72566, "language":
