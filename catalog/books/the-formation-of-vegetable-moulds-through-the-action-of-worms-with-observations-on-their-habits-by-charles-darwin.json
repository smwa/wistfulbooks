{"title": "Formation of Vegetable Moulds through the Action of Worms with Observations on their Habits", "description": "Charles Darwin LL.B F.R.S was the discoverer of evolution and argued the role of \"natural selection\" in directing the evolution of species. Darwin also had an interest in the formation of soils (moulds) that began relatively early in his life, with a paper \"On the Formation of Vegetable Moulds\" delivered to the Geological Society of London in 1937. Darwin's last book, The Formation of Vegetable Moulds through the Action of Worms with Observations on their Habits, was completed in 1881.
