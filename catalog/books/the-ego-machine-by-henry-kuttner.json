{"title": "Ego Machine", "description": "Celebrated playwright Nicholas Martin didn\u2019t read the small print in his Hollywood options contract. Now he\u2019s facing five years of servitude to a conceited director named Raoul St. Cyr, who\u2019s taken a thoughtful play about Portuguese fishermen and added dancing mermaids. When it seems the plot has changed to include a robot from the future Nicholas looses all hope, but this robot may be just what he needs to win his freedom. \u2013 The Ego Machine was first published in the May, 1952 issue of Space Science Fiction magazine.
