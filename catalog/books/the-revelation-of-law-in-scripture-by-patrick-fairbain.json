{"title": "Revelation of Law in Scripture", "description": "The subject of 'The Revelation of Law in Scripture' is profoundly important at all times, but especially in the present day, when it is brought into hard conflict with modern speculations, and with the tendencies of religious thought current in Britain and elsewhere, subversive in various ways of the foundations of moral and religious obligation. This is eminently a book for the times. In no work of the same compass will the reader find a more satisfactory and a fresher discussion of the great questions relating to the moral law, or a more complete exposure of the false theories respecting it that now prevail. But while combating these theories, the lectures are far from wearing a controversial aspect, the author being anxious rather to unfold and establish what is true than to enter into a minute and laboured refutation of the false. - Summary by British and Foreign Evangelical Review 1869", "duration": 56391, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "17164", "name": "Patrick Fairbain"}],
