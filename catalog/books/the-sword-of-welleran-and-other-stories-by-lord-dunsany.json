{"title": "Sword of Welleran and Other Stories", "description": "The Sword of Welleran and Other Stories is the third book by Irish fantasy writer Lord Dunsany, considered a major influence on the work of J. R. R. Tolkien, H. P. Lovecraft, Ursula K. Le Guin and others. It was first published in hardcover by George Allen & Sons in October, 1908, and has been reprinted a number of times since. Issued by the Modern Library in a combined edition with A Dreamer's Tales as A Dreamer's Tales and Other Stories in 1917.<br /><br />\n\nThe book is a series of short stories, some of them linked by Dunsany's invented pantheon of deities who dwell in Peg\u0101na, which were the focus of his earlier collections The Gods of Peg\u0101na and Time and the Gods. One of the stories, \"The Fortress Unvanquishable, Save for Sacnoth,\" was afterwards (1910) published by itself as a separate book. - Summary by Wikipedia", "duration": 13746, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "17", "name": "Lord Dunsany"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt30/swordofwelleran_1410.jpg", "copyright_year": "1908", "genres": ["Single Author Collections"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Ann Boulais"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Ann Boulais"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Ann Boulais"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "The Sword of Welleran", "readers": [9393], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/sword_of_welleran_1409_librivox/swordofwelleran_01_dunsany_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2057}, {"section": 2, "title": "The Fall of Babbulkund", "readers": [2921], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/sword_of_welleran_1409_librivox/swordofwelleran_02_dunsany_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2228}, {"section": 3, "title": "The Kith of the Elf Folk, Ch 1", "readers": [9411], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/sword_of_welleran_1409_librivox/swordofwelleran_03_dunsany_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1414}, {"section": 4, "title": "The Kith of the Elf Folk, Ch 2", "readers": [9411], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/sword_of_welleran_1409_librivox/swordofwelleran_04_dunsany_64kb.mp3", "duration": 952}, {"section": 5, "title": "The Highwaymen", "readers": [9400], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/sword_of_welleran_1409_librivox/swordofwelleran_05_dunsany_64kb.mp3", "duration": 701}, {"section": 6, "title": "In the Twilight", "readers": [9347], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/sword_of_welleran_1409_librivox/swordofwelleran_06_dunsany_64kb.mp3", "duration": 736}, {"section": 7, "title": "The Ghosts", "readers": [9401], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/sword_of_welleran_1409_librivox/swordofwelleran_07_dunsany_64kb.mp3", "duration": 642}, {"section": 8, "title": "The Whirlpool", "readers": [9105], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/sword_of_welleran_1409_librivox/swordofwelleran_08_dunsany_64kb.mp3", "duration": 518}, {"section": 9, "title": "The Hurricane", "readers": [9331], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/sword_of_welleran_1409_librivox/swordofwelleran_09_dunsany_64kb.mp3", "duration": 220}, {"section": 10, "title": "The Fortress Unvanquishable, Save for Sacnoth", "readers": [9393], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/sword_of_welleran_1409_librivox/swordofwelleran_10_dunsany_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2512}, {"section": 11, "title": "The Lord of Cities", "readers": [9393], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/sword_of_welleran_1409_librivox/swordofwelleran_11_dunsany_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1037}, {"section": 12, "title": "The Doom of La Traviata", "readers": [9284], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/sword_of_welleran_1409_librivox/swordofwelleran_12_dunsany_64kb.mp3", "duration": 412}, {"section": 13, "title": "On the Dry Land", "readers": [9331], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/sword_of_welleran_1409_librivox/swordofwelleran_13_dunsany_64kb.mp3", "duration": 317}]}
