{"title": "Mice & Other Poems", "description": "Gerald William Bullett was a British man of letters. He was known as a novelist, essayist, short story writer, critic and poet. He wrote both supernatural fiction and some children's literature.  \"Mice & Other Poems\" is one of a series of small volumes of poetry published after WWI mostly by graduates of the University of Cambridge.  The doyen of \"Cambridge English\", Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch, had this to say about the series:  \"That since the War, young men in extraordinary numbers have taken to expressing themselves in verse is a plain fact, not to be denied: that they choose, as often as not, to express themselves in 'numbers' extraordinary to us can as hardly be contested. But the point is, they have a crowding impulse to say something; and to say it with the emotional seriousness proper to Poetry. For my part, I love the discipline of verse: but I love the impulse better. Time will soften\u2014I hope not too soon, lest it sugar down and sentimentalise\u2014a certain bitterness of resentment observable in this booklet and its next followers: but, as nothing in verse is nobler than true tradition, anything is more hopeful than convention.\" - Summary by John Burlinson", "duration": 1989, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "12249", "name": "Gerald Bullett"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/mice_other_poems_jb_1609_librivox/mice_1609.jpg", "copyright_year": "1921", "genres": ["Single author"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "John Burlinson"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "John Burlinson"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Ann Boulais"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Tony Addison"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Prefatory Note by Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch", "readers": [10396], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/mice_other_poems_jb_1609_librivox/miceotherpoems_00_bullett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 219}, {"section": 1, "title": "Mice", "readers": [10396], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/mice_other_poems_jb_1609_librivox/miceotherpoems_01_bullett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 90}, {"section": 2, "title": "Rest", "readers": [10396], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/mice_other_poems_jb_1609_librivox/miceotherpoems_02_bullett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 79}, {"section": 3, "title": "'The Strength, the Mellow Music, and the Laughter'", "readers": [10396], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/mice_other_poems_jb_1609_librivox/miceotherpoems_03_bullett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 88}, {"section": 4, "title": "Ashes", "readers": [10396], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/mice_other_poems_jb_1609_librivox/miceotherpoems_04_bullett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 74}, {"section": 5, "title": "'Du bist wie eine Blume'", "readers": [10396], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/mice_other_poems_jb_1609_librivox/miceotherpoems_05_bullett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 55}, {"section": 6, "title": "Home", "readers": [10396], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/mice_other_poems_jb_1609_librivox/miceotherpoems_06_bullett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 87}, {"section": 7, "title": "'Ma\u00eetre de Ballet'", "readers": [10396], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/mice_other_poems_jb_1609_librivox/miceotherpoems_07_bullett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 80}, {"section": 8, "title": "The Grudge", "readers": [10396], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/mice_other_poems_jb_1609_librivox/miceotherpoems_08_bullett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 166}, {"section": 9, "title": "Wedding Day", "readers": [10396], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/mice_other_poems_jb_1609_librivox/miceotherpoems_09_bullett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 126}, {"section": 10, "title": "Crucifixion", "readers": [10396], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/mice_other_poems_jb_1609_librivox/miceotherpoems_10_bullett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 86}, {"section": 11, "title": "Spring in Winter", "readers": [10396], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/mice_other_poems_jb_1609_librivox/miceotherpoems_11_bullett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 86}, {"section": 12, "title": "The Exile", "readers": [10396], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/mice_other_poems_jb_1609_librivox/miceotherpoems_12_bullett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 89}, {"section": 13, "title": "Sonnet for Helen", "readers": [10396], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/mice_other_poems_jb_1609_librivox/miceotherpoems_13_bullett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 111}, {"section": 14, "title": "Song", "readers": [10396], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/mice_other_poems_jb_1609_librivox/miceotherpoems_14_bullett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 85}, {"section": 15, "title": "Musings", "readers": [10396], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/mice_other_poems_jb_1609_librivox/miceotherpoems_15_bullett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 89}, {"section": 16, "title": "The Poet", "readers": [10396], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/mice_other_poems_jb_1609_librivox/miceotherpoems_16_bullett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 139}, {"section": 17, "title": "'If all the trees were magic trees'", "readers": [10396], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/mice_other_poems_jb_1609_librivox/miceotherpoems_17_bullett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 129}, {"section": 18, "title": "'Alone with these my poems...'", "readers": [10396], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/mice_other_poems_jb_1609_librivox/miceotherpoems_18_bullett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 111}]}
