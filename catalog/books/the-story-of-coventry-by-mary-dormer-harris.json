{"title": "Story of Coventry", "description": "Nowadays best known for its bombing in WWII, the English city of Coventry was founded in the early Middle Ages. Earl Leofric and his wife Lady Godiva (famously riding naked through the streets) founded a Benedictine monastery in 1043, and over time, the city became a  major pilgrimage center. During the Wars of the Roses (1455 - 1487), the Royal Court was moved to Coventry and parliament was held in the city as well.\r\n\r\nIn this book Mary Dormer Harris follows Coventry's history through the Middle Ages. While looking at famous people from Coventry and their influence on the city's architecture, she also details the daily lives of the common townsfolk, the guild, and their contributions to the city's thriving economy. \r\n\r\nThis book is part of the \"Mediaeval Town\" series published in the early 20th century.
