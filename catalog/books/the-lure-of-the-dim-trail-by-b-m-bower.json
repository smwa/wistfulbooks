{"title": "Lure of the Dim Trails", "description": "Phil Thurston was born on the range where the trails are dim and silent under the big sky. It was the place his father loved, the place he had to be. After the death of his father when he was five, his mother brought him back to the city, where he grew up and became a writer. To revive his stale writing, he returns to the West, and may just find what he is really missing. (Summary by A. Gramour)", "duration": 11434, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "1778", "name": "B. M.
