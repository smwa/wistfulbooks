{"title": "Gettysburg National Military Park, Pennsylvania", "description": "On the gently rolling farm lands surrounding the little town of Gettysburg, Pa., was fought one of the great decisive battles of American history. For 3 days, from July 1 to 3, 1863, a gigantic struggle between 75,000 Confederates and 88,000 Union troops raged about the town and left 51,000 casualties in its wake. Heroic deeds were numerous on both sides, climaxed by the famed Confederate assault on July 3 which has become known throughout the world as Pickett\u2019s Charge. The Union victory gained on these fields ended the last Confederate invasion of the North and marked the beginning of a gradual decline in Southern military power.  Here also, a few months after the battle, Abraham Lincoln delivered his classic Gettysburg Address at the dedication of the national cemetery set apart as a burial ground for the soldiers who died in the conflict.  This 1954 publication (revised in 1961) is number 9 in the Historical Handbook series put out by the U.S. National Park Service.  The author was a World War I veteran, a noted Civil War historian, and chief historian for the Gettysburg National Military Park in the 1950s and 1960s. - Summary by Frederick Tilberg and David Wales", "duration": 5607, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "16471", "name": "Frederick Herman Tilberg"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/gettysburg_national_military_park_2110_librivox/gettysburgnational_2021.jpg", "copyright_year": "1961", "genres": ["War & Military", "History", "Modern (20th C)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "David Wales"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "David Wales"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "DaveC"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "DaveC"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Part 1 - Introducion Spring 1863; The Battle Of Oak Ridge", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/gettysburg_national_military_park_2110_librivox/gettysburgnational_01_tilberg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 536}, {"section": 2, "title": "Part 2 - The First Day: The Two Armies Converge On Gettysburg; The Battle Of Oak Ridge", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/gettysburg_national_military_park_2110_librivox/gettysburgnational_02_tilberg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 754}, {"section": 3, "title": "Part 3 - The Second Day: Preliminary Movements And Plans; Longstreet Attacks On The Right; Warren Saves Little Round Top; Culp's Hill", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/gettysburg_national_military_park_2110_librivox/gettysburgnational_03_tilberg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 693}, {"section": 4, "title": "Part 4 - The Third Day: Cannonade At Dawn Culp's Hill And Spangler's Spring; Lee Plans A Final Thrust; Lee And Meade Set The Stage; Artillery Duel At One O'Clock; Climax At Gettysburg; Cavalry Action; End Of Invasion", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/gettysburg_national_military_park_2110_librivox/gettysburgnational_04_tilberg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1308}, {"section": 5, "title": "Part 5 - Lincoln And Gettysburg: Establishment Of A Burial Ground; Dedication Of The Cemetery; Genesis Of The Gettysburg Address; The Five Autograph Copies Of The Gettysburg Address; Soldiers' National Monument; The Lincoln Address Memorial", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/gettysburg_national_military_park_2110_librivox/gettysburgnational_05_tilberg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1124}, {"section": 6, "title": "Part 6 - Guide Tour Of The Park", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/gettysburg_national_military_park_2110_librivox/gettysburgnational_06_tilberg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1192}]}
