Well\u2026 Who were we to disabuse him of his irrational \u2018class envy\u2019 and we just had to string him along! It would have been rude not to!<br>\r\n\r\n    So, did Bunce find out the truth about the \u2018Bobby\u2019? Did we really have \u2018pony\u2019 bangers for breakfast? Was Bunce\u2019s \u2018bloatered\u2019 bag the source of an overpowering smell in the railway carriage? And did we manage to prevent the entire holiday from descending into a complete and utter farce?<br>\r\n\r\n    There is so much to tell \u2013 and so little space left to write of it!  So, why not wind up your old gramophone, bung on the attached recordings and listen to the entire yarn in the comfort of your own front parlour?<br>\r\n\r\n    With Best Wishes from the Norfolk Broads \u2013 FZ</i><br>\r\n\r\n<b> \u2026 then imagine that holiday message cribbed and used as a summary by TND!</b> - Summary by TND", "duration": 26985, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "18140", "name": "Fritz Zorn"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/buncethebobbyandthebroads_2402_librivox/buncethebobbyandthebroads_2402.jpg", "copyright_year": "1900", "genres": ["Travel Fiction", "Humorous Fiction"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "TND"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "TND"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "TriciaG"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "KevinS"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Chapter 1", "readers": [9128], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/buncethebobbyandthebroads_2402_librivox/buncethebobby_01_zorn_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1107}, {"section": 2, "title": "Chapter 2 - Part 1", "readers": [9128], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/buncethebobbyandthebroads_2402_librivox/buncethebobby_02_zorn_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1857}, {"section": 3, "title": "Chapter 2 - Part 2", "readers": [9128], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/buncethebobbyandthebroads_2402_librivox/buncethebobby_03_zorn_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1651}, {"section": 4, "title": "Chapter 3", "readers": [9128], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/buncethebobbyandthebroads_2402_librivox/buncethebobby_04_zorn_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2021}, {"section": 5, "title": "Chapter 4", "readers": [9128], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/buncethebobbyandthebroads_2402_librivox/buncethebobby_05_zorn_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1913}, {"section": 6, "title": "Chapter 5", "readers": [9128], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/buncethebobbyandthebroads_2402_librivox/buncethebobby_06_zorn_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2115}, {"section": 7, "title": "Chapter 6 - Part 1", "readers": [9128], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/buncethebobbyandthebroads_2402_librivox/buncethebobby_07_zorn_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1603}, {"section": 8, "title": "Chapter 6 - Part 2", "readers": [9128], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/buncethebobbyandthebroads_2402_librivox/buncethebobby_08_zorn_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1974}, {"section": 9, "title": "Chapter 7 - Part 1", "readers": [9128], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/buncethebobbyandthebroads_2402_librivox/buncethebobby_09_zorn_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1568}, {"section": 10, "title": "Chapter 7 - Part 2", "readers": [9128], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/buncethebobbyandthebroads_2402_librivox/buncethebobby_10_zorn_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1818}, {"section": 11, "title": "Chapter 8 - Part 1", "readers": [9128], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/buncethebobbyandthebroads_2402_librivox/buncethebobby_11_zorn_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1752}, {"section": 12, "title": "Chapter 8 - Part 2", "readers": [9128], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/buncethebobbyandthebroads_2402_librivox/buncethebobby_12_zorn_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1827}, {"section": 13, "title": "Chapter 9 - Part 1", "readers": [9128], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/buncethebobbyandthebroads_2402_librivox/buncethebobby_13_zorn_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1591}, {"section": 14, "title": "Chapter 9 - Part 2", "readers": [9128], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/buncethebobbyandthebroads_2402_librivox/buncethebobby_14_zorn_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1774}, {"section": 15, "title": "Chapter 10 - Part 1", "readers": [9128], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/buncethebobbyandthebroads_2402_librivox/buncethebobby_15_zorn_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1094}, {"section": 16, "title": "Chapter 10 - Part 2", "readers": [9128], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/buncethebobbyandthebroads_2402_librivox/buncethebobby_16_zorn_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1320}]}
