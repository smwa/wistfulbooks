{"title": "Poetry of St John of the Cross", "description": "The poems of St John of the Cross, with their mystic depth and spiritual ecstasy, stand among the world's great poems of Divine Love in all traditions.  St John is one of the Roman Catholic Doctors of the Church, was a reformer of the Carmelite Order, and co-founder with St Teresa of Avila of the Discalced Carmelites.  Teresa invited John to follow her, and in the protocols of the times, also became her Spiritual Director and Confessor.  Many of their individual works could be considered the products of their mutual support and inspiration.   - Summary by Ed Humpal", "duration": 4409, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "8714", "name": "Saint John of the Cross"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/poetry_st_john_of_the_cross_1408_librivox/poetry_of_st_john_of_the_cross_1408_.jpg", "copyright_year": "1919", "genres": ["Single author"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Ed Humpal"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Ed Humpal"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Ann Boulais"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Ann Boulais"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "The Dark Night", "readers": [9393], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/poetry_st_john_of_the_cross_1408_librivox/poetryofstjohnofthecross_01_stjohnofthecross_64kb.mp3", "duration": 132}, {"section": 2, "title": "Song of the Soul and It's Bridegroom", "readers": [9393], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/poetry_st_john_of_the_cross_1408_librivox/poetryofstjohnofthecross_02_stjohnofthecross_64kb.mp3", "duration": 833}, {"section": 3, "title": "The Living Flame of Love", "readers": [9393], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/poetry_st_john_of_the_cross_1408_librivox/poetryofstjohnofthecross_03_stjohnofthecross_64kb.mp3", "duration": 81}, {"section": 4, "title": "A Soul Longing for the Vision of God", "readers": [9393], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/poetry_st_john_of_the_cross_1408_librivox/poetryofstjohnofthecross_04_stjohnofthecross_64kb.mp3", "duration": 194}, {"section": 5, "title": "Ecstasy of Contemplation", "readers": [9393], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/poetry_st_john_of_the_cross_1408_librivox/poetryofstjohnofthecross_05_stjohnofthecross_64kb.mp3", "duration": 281}, {"section": 6, "title": "God the Supreme Good", "readers": [9393], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/poetry_st_john_of_the_cross_1408_librivox/poetryofstjohnofthecross_06_stjohnofthecross_64kb.mp3", "duration": 305}, {"section": 7, "title": "Song of the Soul Rejoicing in the Knowledge of God by Faith", "readers": [9393], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/poetry_st_john_of_the_cross_1408_librivox/poetryofstjohnofthecross_07_stjohnofthecross_64kb.mp3", "duration": 123}, {"section": 8, "title": "Song of Christ and the Soul", "readers": [9393], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/poetry_st_john_of_the_cross_1408_librivox/poetryofstjohnofthecross_08_stjohnofthecross_64kb.mp3", "duration": 92}, {"section": 9, "title": "The Most Holy Trinity, & The Communication of the Three Persons", "readers": [9393], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/poetry_st_john_of_the_cross_1408_librivox/poetryofstjohnofthecross_09_stjohnofthecross_64kb.mp3", "duration": 230}, {"section": 10, "title": "The Creation", "readers": [9393], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/poetry_st_john_of_the_cross_1408_librivox/poetryofstjohnofthecross_10_stjohnofthecross_64kb.mp3", "duration": 265}, {"section": 11, "title": "The Desires of the Holy Fathers", "readers": [9393], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/poetry_st_john_of_the_cross_1408_librivox/poetryofstjohnofthecross_11_stjohnofthecross_64kb.mp3", "duration": 156}, {"section": 12, "title": "The Incarnation & The Nativity", "readers": [9393], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/poetry_st_john_of_the_cross_1408_librivox/poetryofstjohnofthecross_12_stjohnofthecross_64kb.mp3", "duration": 263}, {"section": 13, "title": "Super Flumina Babylonis", "readers": [9393], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/poetry_st_john_of_the_cross_1408_librivox/poetryofstjohnofthecross_13_stjohnofthecross_64kb.mp3", "duration": 194}, {"section": 14, "title": "Three Songs: The Soul's Craving, The Exiled Soul, & Desolation", "readers": [9393], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/poetry_st_john_of_the_cross_1408_librivox/poetryofstjohnofthecross_14_stjohnofthecross_64kb.mp3", "duration": 479}, {"section": 15, "title": "The Dark Night (II) & O Sweet Dark Night", "readers": [9393], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/poetry_st_john_of_the_cross_1408_librivox/poetryofstjohnofthecross_15_stjohnofthecross_64kb.mp3", "duration": 425}, {"section": 16, "title": "The Soul's Desire to Be with Christ & Ecstasy", "readers": [9393], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/poetry_st_john_of_the_cross_1408_librivox/poetryofstjohnofthecross_16_stjohnofthecross_64kb.mp3", "duration": 356}]}
