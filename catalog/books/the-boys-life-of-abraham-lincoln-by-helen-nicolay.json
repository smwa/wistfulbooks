{"title": "Boys' Life of Abraham Lincoln", "description": "The Boys\u2019 Life of Abraham Lincoln is a biography with many anecdotes that takes one deeper into the thoughts, personality, and beliefs of the man that was Lincoln. While the title indicates the book is about Lincoln\u2019s life as a boy, the book is a full, if somewhat shortened biography. It is very well written and was a joy to record. One might ask, \"Who was Helen Nicolay?\" Her father, John George Nicolay, was Abraham Lincoln's private secretary and doubtless much of the material comes from his complete biography of Abraham Lincoln.
