He arrived in Australia in 1878, and became a freelance journalist and writer in both Melbourne and Sydney. He is notable for becoming the first author in Australia who tried to earn a living from writing alone. In Sydney in 1898, he founded the bohemian Dawn and Dusk Club, which had many notable members such as writer Henry Lawson. He died at Sydney of tuberculosis.<br /><br />\n\nHe used the pseudonym Creeve Roe (Irish =Red Branch - the area next to the Navan where Cu Chulainn trained as a Red Branch Knight), as well as his own name.
