{"title": "Weird Tales Presents: Women of Weird Fiction Volume 1", "description": "While Weird Tales Magazine is often mentioned along with some of its most well-known male authors such as H. P. Lovecraft, Robert E. Howard and Clark Ashton Smith, many women have provided ghastly and grotesque contributions throughout the years.  It even had a female editor for fourteen years from 1940 to 1952.  As such, we feel it is about time to shed more light on many of these unheralded female writers who proved that Weird Tales was more than just a boy's club.  In this first of what is hopefully several volumes of such stories, we invite you to dim the lights, light a candle and prepare to experience the weird and wonderful! - Summary by Ben Tucker", "duration": 23853, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "18", "name": " Various"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/womenweirdfictionvol1_2410_librivox/weird_mad_women1_2410.jpg", "copyright_year": "1928", "genres": ["Crime & Mystery Fiction", "Horror & Supernatural Fiction"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Ben Tucker"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "J.
