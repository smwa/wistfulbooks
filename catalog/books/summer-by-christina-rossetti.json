{"title": "Summer", "description": "Christina Georgina Rossetti was an English poet who wrote a variety of romantic, devotional, and children's poems. She is famous for writing Goblin Market and Remember, and the words of the Christmas carol In the Bleak Midwinter.\nRossetti was educated at home by her mother and father, who had her study religious works, classics, fairy tales and novels. Rossetti delighted in the works of Keats, Scott, Ann Radcliffe and Matthew Lewis. The influence of the work of Dante Alighieri, Petrarch and other Italian writers filled the home and would have a deep impact on Rossetti's later writing. Their home was open to visiting Italian scholars, artists and revolutionaries. - Summary by Wikipedia", "duration": 1012, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "601", "name": "Christina Rossetti"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt24/summer_1607.jpg", "copyright_year": "1906", "genres": ["Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Summer - Read by AH", "readers": [11019], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/summer_1607.poem_librivox/summer_rossetti_ah_64kb.mp3", "duration": 88}, {"section": 2, "title": "Summer - Read by ALP", "readers": [4705], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/summer_1607.poem_librivox/summer_rossetti_alp_64kb.mp3", "duration": 75}, {"section": 3, "title": "Summer - Read by BK", "readers": [8786], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/summer_1607.poem_librivox/summer_rossetti_bk_64kb.mp3", "duration": 96}, {"section": 4, "title": "Summer - Read by BMH", "readers": [10686], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/summer_1607.poem_librivox/summer_rossetti_bmh_64kb.mp3", "duration": 69}, {"section": 5, "title": "Summer - Read by BSD", "readers": [10402], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/summer_1607.poem_librivox/summer_rossetti_bsd_64kb.mp3", "duration": 84}, {"section": 6, "title": "Summer - Read by DL", "readers": [2911], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/summer_1607.poem_librivox/summer_rossetti_dl_64kb.mp3", "duration": 81}, {"section": 7, "title": "Summer - Read by GB", "readers": [4969], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/summer_1607.poem_librivox/summer_rossetti_gb_64kb.mp3", "duration": 88}, {"section": 8, "title": "Summer - Read by IK", "readers": [7785], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/summer_1607.poem_librivox/summer_rossetti_ik_64kb.mp3", "duration": 86}, {"section": 9, "title": "Summer - Read by LAH", "readers": [1212], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/summer_1607.poem_librivox/summer_rossetti_lah_64kb.mp3", "duration": 85}, {"section": 10, "title": "Summer - Read by MK", "readers": [8051], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/summer_1607.poem_librivox/summer_rossetti_mk_64kb.mp3", "duration": 100}, {"section": 11, "title": "Summer - Read by MSD", "readers": [10891], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/summer_1607.poem_librivox/summer_rossetti_msd_64kb.mp3", "duration": 82}, {"section": 12, "title": "Summer - Read by TP", "readers": [10789], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/summer_1607.poem_librivox/summer_rossetti_tp_64kb.mp3", "duration": 78}]}
