{"title": "Enneads", "description": "The six Enneads (\u0395\u039d\u039d\u0395\u0391\u0394\u0395\u03a3) are the collected writings of the Neoplatonic philosopher Plotinus (\u03a0\u039b\u03a9\u03a4\u0399\u039d\u039f\u03a3) arranged by his student Porphyry (\u03a0\u039f\u03a1\u03a6\u03a5\u03a1\u0399\u039f\u03a3) into fifty-four books with each Ennead containing nine. The translator Kenneth Sylvan Guthrie arranged these books chronologically rather than according to Porphyry's numeration. This recording is organized according to Porphyry's numeration with Roman numerals indicating the Ennead and Hindu-Arabic numerals indicating the book e.g. VI.9 would be the ninth book of the sixth Ennead. A hyperlinked table of contents at Volume 1 Page 3 of the gutenberg.org text will enable you to jump to the specific Ennead if you wish to read along with the recording.
