{"title": "Geraldine Jewsbury in Jerrold's Shilling Magazine, 1846-47", "description": "'The most striking feature in the present day, far more than that of railways even, is the utter chaos into which all previously received principles and opinions are reduced'. So begins 'Today', the first in a series of five pieces of social commentary written by Geraldine Jewsbury for Jerrold's Shilling Magazine. Jewsbury would go on to be a prolific contributor to The Atheneum and Household Words. Published shortly after her first novel, 'Zoe', these early pieces include several strongly argued polemics on the sufferings of women and servants in industrial England and advance her lifelong philosophy of the importance of mutual care.  - Summary by Phil Benson", "duration": 10668, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "16028", "name": "Geraldine Jewsbury"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/geraldine_jewsbury_2105_librivox/geraldine_jewsbury_2105.jpg", "copyright_year": "1846", "genres": ["Single Author Collections"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Phil Benson"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Phil Benson"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Annise"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Newgatenovelist"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Today", "readers": [6097], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/geraldine_jewsbury_2105_librivox/jerrolds_01_jewsbury_64kb.mp3", "duration": 443}, {"section": 2, "title": "Things of Importance", "readers": [6097], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/geraldine_jewsbury_2105_librivox/jerrolds_02_jewsbury_64kb.mp3", "duration": 928}, {"section": 3, "title": "Social Barbarisms: Hiring a Servant", "readers": [6097], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/geraldine_jewsbury_2105_librivox/jerrolds_03_jewsbury_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1712}, {"section": 4, "title": "How Agnes Worral was Taught to be Respectable", "readers": [6097], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/geraldine_jewsbury_2105_librivox/jerrolds_04_jewsbury_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1490}, {"section": 5, "title": "How Agnes Worral was Taught to be Respectable (continued)", "readers": [6097], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/geraldine_jewsbury_2105_librivox/jerrolds_05_jewsbury_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3521}, {"section": 6, "title": "The Lower Orders", "readers": [6097], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/geraldine_jewsbury_2105_librivox/jerrolds_06_jewsbury_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1034}, {"section": 7, "title": "Civilization of the Lower Orders", "readers": [6097], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/geraldine_jewsbury_2105_librivox/jerrolds_07_jewsbury_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1540}]}
