{"title": "Statement of Stella Maberly", "description": "From childhood Stella Maberly has been violently wilful and jealous, yet certain of her own superiority. She can be loving and friendly, but soon loses friends, when in the grip of her \u201cdemons\u201d she acts with disdain and subtle cruelty, and then revels in the misery of her loneliness. Her paranoia results in tragedy for her best friend Evelyn, and Stella comes to believe that Evelyn is possessed by an evil spirit. In this statement Stella reflects on the events leading to her present situation...Was the evil imagined? Who was \u201cpossessed\u201d? Is Stella to be blamed or pitied? This story can be seen from two viewpoints: do we take the words of the other characters literally at face value, or are we being influenced by Stella's interpretation? It\u2019s fun to try interpreting from both angles! (Summary by Anne F)", "duration": 15786, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "1631", "name": "F.
