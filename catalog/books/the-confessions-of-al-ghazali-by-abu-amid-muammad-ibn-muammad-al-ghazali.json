{"title": "Confessions of al-Ghazali", "description": "Abu Hamid al-Ghazali was born in 1058 AD in the city of Tus in modern day Iran.  He was a reputed scholar, philosopher and Shafi'i jurist who was a professor of theology at the Nizamiyya College of Baghdad.  At the peak of his fame, he was gripped by an internal schism between his beliefs and his inner self.  He gave up his position lead a life of seclusion and personal mystical transformation. During this time of solitude and contemplation he authored a number of seminal works reconciling the outward practices of Islam with a deep inner spirituality.  The Confessions of al-Ghazali (Munkidh min al-Dalal, literally Deliverance from Error), is an intellectual autobiography on al-Ghazali's transformation.  In this work he catalogs  the various sects and schools of thought he encountered on his search for the divine truth. - Summary by Zishan Sheikh", "duration": 5392, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "10472", "name": "Ab\u016b \u1e24\u0101mid Mu\u1e25ammad ibn Mu\u1e25ammad al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/confessionsalghazali_1610_librivox/confessions_al_ghazali_1610.jpg", "copyright_year": "1909", "genres": ["Other religions"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "TomDavisBeal"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Diana Majlinger"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "DaveC"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Introduction", "readers": [9073], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/confessionsalghazali_1610_librivox/confessionsofalghazali_0_alghazali_64kb.mp3", "duration": 311}, {"section": 1, "title": "Gazzali's Search for Truth", "readers": [9073], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/confessionsalghazali_1610_librivox/confessionsofalghazali_1_alghazali_64kb.mp3", "duration": 406}, {"section": 2, "title": "The Subterfuges of the Sophists", "readers": [9073], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/confessionsalghazali_1610_librivox/confessionsofalghazali_2_alghazali_64kb.mp3", "duration": 486}, {"section": 3, "title": "The Different Kinds of Seekers after Truth", "readers": [11067], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/confessionsalghazali_1610_librivox/confessionsofalghazali_3_alghazali_64kb.mp3", "duration": 135}, {"section": 4, "title": "The Aim of Scholastic Theology and its Results", "readers": [11067], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/confessionsalghazali_1610_librivox/confessionsofalghazali_4_alghazali_64kb.mp3", "duration": 411}, {"section": 5, "title": "Concerning the Philosophical Sects and the Stigma of Infidelity Which Attaches to Them All", "readers": [11067], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/confessionsalghazali_1610_librivox/confessionsofalghazali_5_alghazali_64kb.mp3", "duration": 313}, {"section": 6, "title": "Divisions of the Philosophic Sciences", "readers": [11067], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/confessionsalghazali_1610_librivox/confessionsofalghazali_6_alghazali_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1344}, {"section": 7, "title": "Sufism", "readers": [11067], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/confessionsalghazali_1610_librivox/confessionsofalghazali_7_alghazali_64kb.mp3", "duration": 978}, {"section": 8, "title": "The Reality of Inspiration : its Importance for the Human Race", "readers": [11067], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/confessionsalghazali_1610_librivox/confessionsofalghazali_8_alghazali_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1008}]}
