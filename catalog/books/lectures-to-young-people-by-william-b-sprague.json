{"title": "Lectures to Young People", "description": "The plan of the following course of Lectures was suggested to the author, by his having often felt the need of a book to put into the hands of the young, which would yield them counsel and instruction adapted to every variety of circumstances. Such a book he has here attempted to supply; \u2014 a book designed to guard the moral principles and habits of youth, amidst the temptations of the world; to impress them with the infinite obligations and advantages of religion; to conduct them through that most interesting period of anxious inquiry concerning their salvation; to bring them to a cordial acceptance of the gospel offer; to assist them in ascertaining their claims to the Christian character; and to enable them to prosecute the various duties and conflicts of the Christian life, in such a manner that they may finish their course with joy. - Summary by Preface", "duration": 37051, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "18363", "name": "William B.
