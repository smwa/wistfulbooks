{"title": "Global Trends 2030: Alternative Worlds", "description": "Global Trends 2030: Alternative Worlds is the fifth installment (published in 2012) in the National Intelligence\r\nCouncil\u2019s series aimed at providing a framework for thinking about the future. As with previous\r\neditions, this report will stimulate strategic thinking by identifying critical trends and\r\npotential discontinuities. It distinguishes between megatrends, those factors that will likely occur\r\nunder any scenario, and game-changers, critical variables whose trajectories are far less certain.\r\nAs the diversity and complexity of various factors has grown, there is\r\nincreased attention to scenarios or alternative worlds.\r\nAt a critical juncture in human history, which could lead to widely contrasting futures.\r\nthe contention is presented that the future is not set in stone, but is malleable, the result of an interplay\r\namong megatrends, game-changers and, above all, human agency. The ultimate goal is to encourage\r\ndecisionmakers\u2014whether in government or outside\u2014to think and plan for the long term so that\r\nnegative futures do not occur and positive ones have a better chance of unfolding.
