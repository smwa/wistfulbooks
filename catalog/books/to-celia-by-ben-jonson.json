{"title": "To Celia", "description": "LibriVox volunteers bring you 12 recordings of To Celia by Ben Jonson. This was the Weekly Poetry project for March 6th, 2011.<br><br>Benjamin Jonson was an English Renaissance dramatist, poet and actor. A contemporary of William Shakespeare, he is best known for his satirical plays, particularly Volpone, The Alchemist, and Bartholomew Fair, which are considered his best, and his lyric poems. A man of vast reading and a seemingly insatiable appetite for controversy, Jonson had an unparalleled breadth of influence on Jacobean and Caroline playwrights and poets. <br><br>To Celia is a poem first published after March 1616 by Ben Jonson. It was set to music after 1770, in the form of the song Drink to Me Only with Thine Eyes, the poem's first line.(summary by Wikipedia)", "duration": 761, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "1176", "name": "Ben Jonson"}], "coverArt": "http://archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt28/To_Celia_1301.jpg", "copyright_year": "1616", "genres": ["Poetry", "Elegies & Odes", "Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "To Celia - Read by ALG", "readers": [4744], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/to_celia_1103_librivox/tocelia_jonson_alg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 52}, {"section": 2, "title": "To Celia - Read by BRB", "readers": [6063], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/to_celia_1103_librivox/tocelia_jonson_brb_64kb.mp3", "duration": 53}, {"section": 3, "title": "To Celia - Read by CD", "readers": [2733], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/to_celia_1103_librivox/tocelia_jonson_cd_64kb.mp3", "duration": 78}, {"section": 4, "title": "To Celia - Read by DL", "readers": [2911], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/to_celia_1103_librivox/tocelia_jonson_dl_64kb.mp3", "duration": 57}, {"section": 5, "title": "To Celia - Read by DRB", "readers": [94], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/to_celia_1103_librivox/tocelia_jonson_drb_64kb.mp3", "duration": 63}, {"section": 6, "title": "To Celia - Read by GHS", "readers": [4705], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/to_celia_1103_librivox/tocelia_jonson_ghs_64kb.mp3", "duration": 63}, {"section": 7, "title": "To Celia - Read by JCM", "readers": [3470], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/to_celia_1103_librivox/tocelia_jonson_jcm_64kb.mp3", "duration": 58}, {"section": 8, "title": "To Celia - Read by JOC", "readers": [4015], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/to_celia_1103_librivox/tocelia_jonson_joc_64kb.mp3", "duration": 71}, {"section": 9, "title": "To Celia - Read by LLW", "readers": [4738], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/to_celia_1103_librivox/tocelia_jonson_llw_64kb.mp3", "duration": 66}, {"section": 10, "title": "To Celia - Read by LS", "readers": [6147], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/to_celia_1103_librivox/tocelia_jonson_ls_64kb.mp3", "duration": 64}, {"section": 11, "title": "To Celia - Read by RN", "readers": [3465], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/to_celia_1103_librivox/tocelia_jonson_rn_64kb.mp3", "duration": 72}, {"section": 12, "title": "To Celia - Read by WT", "readers": [5694], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/to_celia_1103_librivox/tocelia_jonson_wt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 64}]}
