{"title": "Flowers of the Farm", "description": "\"To-day we are at Willow Farm again, and I want to show you some of the flowers that grow there. I do not mean those which Mrs. Hammond, the farmer's wife, grows in her garden, pretty as they are. We will look rather at the wild flowers in the fields, the hedges, and by the road-side in the lane. No one sows their seed nor takes care of them in any way; yet they grow and blossom year after year, and nearly all of them are beautiful.\" - Arthur Owens Cooke", "duration": 6021, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "370", "name": "Arthur Owens Cooke"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/flowersofthefarm_2112_librivox/flowersofthefarm_2112.jpg", "copyright_year": "0", "genres": ["Nature"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Maida"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Maida"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "J.
