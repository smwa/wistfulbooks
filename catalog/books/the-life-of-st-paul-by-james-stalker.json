{"title": "Life of St. Paul", "description": "Born into privilege and highly educated by the most esteemed teacher of his time, Saul of Tarsus became a leading thinker among the Pharisees.  His zeal for the \"law\" was such that he became the foremost persecutor of the new Christian sect, hauling many men, women and children off to prison or worse.  After his conversion on the road to Damascus, he would often describe himself as the chief of sinners.  Yet no other Apostle worked as hard as he or achieved so much in furthering the spread of the Gospel. - Summary by Ron Altman", "duration": 19167, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "3223", "name": "James Stalker"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/lifeofstpaul_2403_librivox/lifeofstpaul_2403.jpg", "copyright_year": "1912", "genres": ["Christianity - Biographies"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Ron Altman"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Ron Altman"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "TriciaG"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "mleigh"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Life of St. Paul 01", "readers": [6535], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/lifeofstpaul_2403_librivox/lifeofstpaul_01_stalker_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1229}, {"section": 2, "title": "Life of St. Paul 02", "readers": [6535], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/lifeofstpaul_2403_librivox/lifeofstpaul_02_stalker_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2418}, {"section": 3, "title": "Life of St. Paul 03", "readers": [6535], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/lifeofstpaul_2403_librivox/lifeofstpaul_03_stalker_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1295}, {"section": 4, "title": "Life of St. Paul 04", "readers": [6535], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/lifeofstpaul_2403_librivox/lifeofstpaul_04_stalker_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1873}, {"section": 5, "title": "Life of St. Paul 05", "readers": [6535], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/lifeofstpaul_2403_librivox/lifeofstpaul_05_stalker_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1123}, {"section": 6, "title": "Life of St. Paul 06", "readers": [6535], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/lifeofstpaul_2403_librivox/lifeofstpaul_06_stalker_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1120}, {"section": 7, "title": "Life of St. Paul 07", "readers": [6535], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/lifeofstpaul_2403_librivox/lifeofstpaul_07_stalker_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1867}, {"section": 8, "title": "Life of St. Paul 08", "readers": [6535], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/lifeofstpaul_2403_librivox/lifeofstpaul_08_stalker_64kb.mp3", "duration": 411}, {"section": 9, "title": "Life of St. Paul 09", "readers": [6535], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/lifeofstpaul_2403_librivox/lifeofstpaul_09_stalker_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2032}, {"section": 10, "title": "Life of St. Paul 10", "readers": [6535], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/lifeofstpaul_2403_librivox/lifeofstpaul_10_stalker_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1384}, {"section": 11, "title": "Life of St. Paul 11", "readers": [6535], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/lifeofstpaul_2403_librivox/lifeofstpaul_11_stalker_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1695}, {"section": 12, "title": "Life of St. Paul 12", "readers": [6535], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/lifeofstpaul_2403_librivox/lifeofstpaul_12_stalker_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2720}]}
