{"title": "Prophet", "description": "The prophet Al Mustafa, before leaving the city where he has been living twelve years, stops to address the people. They call out for his words of wisdom on many sides of the human condition, and he addresses them in terms of love and care. He has much to offer from his observations of the people, and he illustrates with images they can relate to.\n\nThe author, Gibran, was influenced by the Maronites, the Sufis, and the Baha\u2019i. His philosophy, though deist, is primarily aimed at the good within ourselves, and the common-sense ways in which we can unlock it. An illustration from his chapter on Friendship:\n\n\u201cAnd let your best be for your friend.\nIf he must know the ebb of your tide, let him know its flood also.\nFor what is your friend that you should seek him with hours to kill?\nSeek him always with hours to live.\u201d\n\nThe prophet\u2019s gentle words have inspired their translation into over 108 languages. Listen to them with an open mind. You may find some burdens and frustrations hidden within you eased.\n - Summary by Mark", "duration": 5349, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "1542", "name": "Kahlil Gibran"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/prophet1_1901_librivox/prophet1_1901.jpg", "copyright_year": "1923", "genres": ["Family Life", "Literary Fiction", "Free Verse"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Mark F.
