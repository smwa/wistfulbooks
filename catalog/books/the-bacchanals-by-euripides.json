{"title": "Bacchanals", "description": "Euripides' Bacchae is based on the Greek myth of King Pentheus of Thebes and his mother Agave and their punishment by the god Dionysus who proclaims that he has come to Thebes to avenge the slander that he is not the son of Zeus. He intends to introduce Dionysian rites into the city and to demonstrate to Pentheus that he was indeed born a god. At the end of the play Pentheus is torn apart by the women of Thebes and Agave bears his head on a pike to her father Cadmus. Bacchae is distinctive from most other Greek tragedies in that the chorus is an integral part of the plot and the God is not a distant presence but the main protagonist.<BR><BR>\r\nThis translation by Henry Hart Milman, former Professor of Poetry at Oxford University, is in the form of a dramatic poem rather than a play. <BR><BR>\r\n(Summary by Alan Mapstone)<BR><BR>\r\n\r\nCast List: <BR><BR>\r\nDionysus: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/8011\">Greg Giordano</a><br>\r\nPentheus: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/18077\">Paul</a><br>\r\nTiresias: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/6754\">ToddHW</a><br>\r\nCadmus: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/17799\">Jonathan Jones</a><br>\r\nOfficer: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/10542\">David Purdy</a><br>\r\nMessenger: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/16152\">Anna Maria</a><br>\r\nAgave: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/13140\">Jenn Broda</a><br>\r\nChorus of Bacchanals: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/7170\">Alan Mapstone</a><br>", "duration": 5587, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "1247", "name": " Euripides"}], "coverArt": null, "copyright_year": "1865", "genres": ["Classics (Greek & Latin Antiquity)", "Dramatic Readings"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Alan Mapstone"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "ToddHW"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Alan Mapstone"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Part 1", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/bacchanals_2302_librivox/bacchanals_1_euripides_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3058}, {"section": 2, "title": "Part 2", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/bacchanals_2302_librivox/bacchanals_2_euripides_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2529}]}
