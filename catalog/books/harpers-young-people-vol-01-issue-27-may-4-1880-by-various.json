This 27th issue of the serial was published on May 4th, 1880. In this issue, the story of the young sailor on his first voyage continues as his ship makes port on the island of Malta. The legend of General George Washington grows as he allies with the French to defeat the English after years spent in a virtual stalemate in the Revolution. New stories are sure to delight as readers take a picnic with Mother Goose and friends, do good for others as members of the \"Happy Club\", witness a harrowing rescue attempt on an unthawing Russian river, join the sweet spring harvest happening in the sugar bush, and enjoy many more adventures. This periodical was published by Harper & Brothers, known today for their publications Harper's Bazaar and Harper's Magazine. - Summary by Jill Engle", "duration": 6968, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "18", "name": " Various"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/hyp027_2109_librivox/harpers_young_1_27_2109.jpg", "copyright_year": "1880", "genres": ["Children's Fiction", "Children's Non-fiction", "Short Stories"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Jill Engle"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "J.
