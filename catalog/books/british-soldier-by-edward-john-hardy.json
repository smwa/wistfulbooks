His 1915 collection of anecdotes is by and about the British soldier, the \u201cTommy\u201d or \u201cMr. Thomas Atkins\u201d as Hardy calls him.  \u201cI did not need a war of nations to learn about the courage and humour of the British soldier\u2026.  . I have done little more than select and classify the letters of that best of war correspondents\u2014the British soldier. The letters are a credit to his head and his heart, and throw a searchlight on the war. The soldier wrote of the things he knew about, and the result is that we can see his pen pictures\u2026.\u201d - Summary by Book Preface and david wales", "duration": 19929, "language": "English",
