{"title": "Anecdotes of Great Musicians", "description": "Three hundred anecdotes and biographical sketches of famous composers and performers.\r\n\r\nI have attempted to cull from the mass of material that came to my notice such anecdotes as have two features,\u2014that of being characteristic of the person referred to, and that of possessing sufficient interest; and in this re-narration I have incorporated such bits of musical information, along biographical and historical lines, as came to mind at the time of writing, but letting this feature be secondary to the main idea of the work. Thus it is hoped that while my readers may find interesting anecdote, they may also incidentally find that which is of more permanent value.\r\n \r\nNo classification has been made in the body of the work, thus avoiding monotony in a consecutive reading. The indexes furnish ample references.\r\n\r\nIf these narrations awaken a more general interest in musical biography, one purpose of my labor will have been accomplished.  - Summary by W.
