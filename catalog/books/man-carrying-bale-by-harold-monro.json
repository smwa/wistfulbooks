{"title": "Man Carrying Bale", "description": "Harold Edward Monro was an English poet born in Brussels and proprietor of the Poetry Bookshop in London, which helped many poets bring their work before the public.\nIn his later years, Monro reflected on whether the Poetry Bookshop had fulfilled its purpose and whether it should be closed, but he was too deeply attached to it. According to the English literary historian Dominic Hibberd, \"By now Monro was a disappointed man, appalled at the state of Europe and feeling forgotten by the poets he had helped.\"  He had used up most of his money in subsidizing the shop. - Summary by Wikipedia", "duration": 1099, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "10645", "name": "Harold Monro"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/man_carrying_bale_1807.poem_librivox/man_carrying_bale_1807.jpg", "copyright_year": "1922", "genres": ["Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "David Lawrence"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Man Carrying Bale - Read by ALP", "readers": [4705], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/man_carrying_bale_1807.poem_librivox/carrying_monro_alp_64kb.mp3", "duration": 74}, {"section": 2, "title": "Man Carrying Bale - Read by BK", "readers": [8786], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/man_carrying_bale_1807.poem_librivox/carrying_monro_bk_64kb.mp3", "duration": 94}, {"section": 3, "title": "Man Carrying Bale - Read by CMM", "readers": [11918], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/man_carrying_bale_1807.poem_librivox/carrying_monro_cmm_64kb.mp3", "duration": 60}, {"section": 4, "title": "Man Carrying Bale - Read by DL", "readers": [2911], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/man_carrying_bale_1807.poem_librivox/carrying_monro_dl_64kb.mp3", "duration": 69}, {"section": 5, "title": "Man Carrying Bale - Read by FH", "readers": [12500], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/man_carrying_bale_1807.poem_librivox/carrying_monro_fh_64kb.mp3", "duration": 58}, {"section": 6, "title": "Man Carrying Bale - Read by GB", "readers": [4969], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/man_carrying_bale_1807.poem_librivox/carrying_monro_gb_64kb.mp3", "duration": 84}, {"section": 7, "title": "Man Carrying Bale - Read by GRS", "readers": [12484], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/man_carrying_bale_1807.poem_librivox/carrying_monro_grs_64kb.mp3", "duration": 80}, {"section": 8, "title": "Man Carrying Bale - Read by JH", "readers": [10205], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/man_carrying_bale_1807.poem_librivox/carrying_monro_jh_64kb.mp3", "duration": 78}, {"section": 9, "title": "Man Carrying Bale - Read by LAH", "readers": [1212], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/man_carrying_bale_1807.poem_librivox/carrying_monro_lah_64kb.mp3", "duration": 78}, {"section": 10, "title": "Man Carrying Bale - Read by LCW", "readers": [8425], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/man_carrying_bale_1807.poem_librivox/carrying_monro_lcw_64kb.mp3", "duration": 67}, {"section": 11, "title": "Man Carrying Bale - Read by ND", "readers": [12565], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/man_carrying_bale_1807.poem_librivox/carrying_monro_nd_64kb.mp3", "duration": 71}, {"section": 12, "title": "Man Carrying Bale - Read by PS", "readers": [8576], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/man_carrying_bale_1807.poem_librivox/carrying_monro_ps_64kb.mp3", "duration": 68}, {"section": 13, "title": "Man Carrying Bale - Read by RAJ", "readers": [12236], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/man_carrying_bale_1807.poem_librivox/carrying_monro_raj_64kb.mp3", "duration": 70}, {"section": 14, "title": "Man Carrying Bale - Read by SCHRM", "readers": [12275], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/man_carrying_bale_1807.poem_librivox/carrying_monro_schrm_64kb.mp3", "duration": 77}, {"section": 15, "title": "Man Carrying Bale - Read by TB", "readers": [12447], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/man_carrying_bale_1807.poem_librivox/carrying_monro_tb_64kb.mp3", "duration": 71}]}
