{"title": "Constant Couple", "description": "George Farquhar, the author of this comedy, was the son of a clergyman in the north of Ireland. He was born in the year 1678, discovered an early taste for literature, and wrote poetic stanzas at ten years of age.  In 1694 he was sent to Trinity College, Dublin, and there made such progress in his studies as to acquire considerable reputation. But he was volatile and poor\u2014the first misfortune led him to expense; the second, to devise means how to support his extravagance.<br /><br />\n\nIn the year 1700 he brought out this comedy of \"The Constant Couple; or, A Trip to the Jubilee.\" It was then the Jubilee year at Rome, and the author took advantage of that occurrence to render the title of his drama popular; for which cause alone it must be supposed he made any thing in his play refer to that festival, as no one material point is in any shape connected with it.<br />\n - Summary by Mrs Inchbald, a critic of that time\n<BR><BR>Cast list:<BR>\nSir Harry Wildair: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/10396\">John Burlinson</a><br>\nAlderman Smuggler: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/6548\">Kristin Gjerl\u00f8w</a><br>\nColonel Standard: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/6754\">ToddHW</a><br>\nClincher Junior: <a href=\"\">KHand</a><br>\nClincher Senior: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/10528\">K.
