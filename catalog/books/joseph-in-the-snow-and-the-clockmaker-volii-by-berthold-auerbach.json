{"title": "Joseph in the Snow, and The Clockmaker. Vol. II", "description": "It is an era of mass migration as so many young men seek adventure and fortune abroad. When Lenz and lifelong friend Pilgrim were boys they too had longed to travel. Pilgrim did so, for a time, but not the dutiful Lenz. Lens apprenticed to his father, a master clockmaker. After his father's death, Lenz doted on his mother and she on him. But she too has passed.\r\n\r\nLenz has inherited a good family name and a substantial sum. He is a skilled craftsman and a gifted singer. He will marry his clockmaking skill with his passion for music. His childhood dream of travel gone the way of his youth, Lenz must become a master in his own right. It is high time for him to take a wife and start a family. His close-knit circle of friends support him, but they are concerned. Some think that Lenz might be too trusting in the good intentions of others. Even Pilgrim questions the choice Lenz has made for a bride.\r\n\r\nEstablishing one's place in an ever changing world can indeed be a challenge for a young man. How will kind-hearted Lenz fare? - Summary by Brian Fullen", "duration": 20986, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "2224", "name": "Berthold Auerbach"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/joseph_in_the_snow_2_2302_librivox/joseph_snow2_2302.jpg", "copyright_year": "1861", "genres": ["Literary Fiction"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Brian Fullen"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Amy Gramour"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "lomond"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "\u201cTHE CLOCKMAKER OF THE BLACK FOREST\u201d", "readers": [13075], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/joseph_in_the_snow_2_2302_librivox/clockmaker_00_auerbach_64kb.mp3", "duration": 211}, {"section": 1, "title": "CHAPTER I, \u201cA GOOD NAME\u201d", "readers": [13075], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/joseph_in_the_snow_2_2302_librivox/clockmaker_01_auerbach_64kb.mp3", "duration": 878}, {"section": 2, "title": "CHAPTER II, \u201cTHE MOURNER AND HIS COMPANION\u201d", "readers": [13075], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/joseph_in_the_snow_2_2302_librivox/clockmaker_02_auerbach_64kb.mp3", "duration": 615}, {"section": 3, "title": "CHAPTER III, \u201cWORK AND GOOD DEEDS\u201d", "readers": [13075], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/joseph_in_the_snow_2_2302_librivox/clockmaker_03_auerbach_64kb.mp3", "duration": 891}, {"section": 4, "title": "CHAPTER IV, \u201cEACH ONE FOR HIMSELF\u201d", "readers": [13075], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/joseph_in_the_snow_2_2302_librivox/clockmaker_04_auerbach_64kb.mp3", "duration": 776}, {"section": 5, "title": "CHAPTER V, \u201cPILGRIM'S ADVENTURES\u201d", "readers": [18039], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/joseph_in_the_snow_2_2302_librivox/clockmaker_05_auerbach_64kb.mp3", "duration": 735}, {"section": 6, "title": "CHAPTER VI, \u201cTHE WORLD STEPS IN\u201d", "readers": [13075], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/joseph_in_the_snow_2_2302_librivox/clockmaker_06_auerbach_64kb.mp3", "duration": 942}, {"section": 7, "title": "CHAPTER VII, \u201cTHE CIVILITIES OF A LANDLORD'S PRETTY DAUGHTER\u201d", "readers": [13075], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/joseph_in_the_snow_2_2302_librivox/clockmaker_07_auerbach_64kb.mp3", "duration": 736}, {"section": 8, "title": "CHAPTER VIII, \u201cHAPPINESS DAWNS, AND A NEW MOTHER SPEAKS\u201d", "readers": [13075], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/joseph_in_the_snow_2_2302_librivox/clockmaker_08_auerbach_64kb.mp3", "duration": 868}, {"section": 9, "title": "CHAPTER IX, \u201cA PARLEY WITH FRIENDS\u201d", "readers": [18057], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/joseph_in_the_snow_2_2302_librivox/clockmaker_09_auerbach_64kb.mp3", "duration": 846}, {"section": 10, "title": "CHAPTER X, \u201cA DINNER WITH PETROWITSCH\u201d", "readers": [18057], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/joseph_in_the_snow_2_2302_librivox/clockmaker_10_auerbach_64kb.mp3", "duration": 574}, {"section": 11, "title": "CHAPTER XI, \u201cTHE GREAT CLOCK PLAYS ITS MELODIES, AND FRESH ONES ARE ADDED\u201d", "readers": [18057], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/joseph_in_the_snow_2_2302_librivox/clockmaker_11_auerbach_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1561}, {"section": 12, "title": "CHAPTER XII, \u201cA GOOD ESCORT, AND THOUGHTS OF THE FUTURE\u201d", "readers": [18057], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/joseph_in_the_snow_2_2302_librivox/clockmaker_12_auerbach_64kb.mp3", "duration": 938}, {"section": 13, "title": "CHAPTER XIII, \u201cLION, FOX, AND MAGPIE\u201d", "readers": [18024], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/joseph_in_the_snow_2_2302_librivox/clockmaker_13_auerbach_64kb.mp3", "duration": 989}, {"section": 14, "title": "CHAPTER XIV, \u201cPRESSES AND EYES ARE OPENED\u201d", "readers": [18024], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/joseph_in_the_snow_2_2302_librivox/clockmaker_14_auerbach_64kb.mp3", "duration": 894}, {"section": 15, "title": "CHAPTER XV, \u201cYOUNG HEARTS -
