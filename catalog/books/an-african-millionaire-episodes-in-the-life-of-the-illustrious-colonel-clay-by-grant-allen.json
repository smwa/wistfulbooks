{"title": "African Millionaire: Episodes in the Life of the Illustrious Colonel Clay", "description": "\"My name is Seymour Wilbraham Wentworth. I am brother-in-law and secretary to Sir Charles Vandrift, the South African millionaire and famous financier. Many years ago, when Charlie Vandrift was a small lawyer in Cape Town, I had the (qualified) good fortune to marry his sister. Much later, when the Vandrift estate and farm near Kimberley developed by degrees into the Cloetedorp Golcondas, Limited, my brother-in-law offered me the not unremunerative post of secretary; in which capacity I have ever since been his constant and attached companion.\" An illustrious scientist, Allen came to fiction as a more lucrative avenue than more serious writing. As well as writing ghost and detective stories, he introduced us to the illustrious Colonel Clay, a precursor of other gentleman rogue characters; he notably bears a strong resemblance to Maurice Leblanc's Ars\u00e8ne Lupin, introduced some years later. - Summary by Lynne Thompson, quote from the first chapter", "duration": 27797, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "285", "name": "Grant Allen"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/librivoxcdcoverart36/africanmillionaire_2004.jpg", "copyright_year": "1897", "genres": ["Crime & Mystery Fiction"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Lynne T"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Lynne T"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "The Episode of the Mexican Seer", "readers": [13879], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/african_millionaire_2004_librivox/africanmillionaire_01_allen_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2115}, {"section": 2, "title": "The Episode of the Diamond Links", "readers": [5789], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/african_millionaire_2004_librivox/africanmillionaire_02_allen_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2667}, {"section": 3, "title": "The Episode of the Old Master", "readers": [5789], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/african_millionaire_2004_librivox/africanmillionaire_03_allen_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2431}, {"section": 4, "title": "The Episode of the Tyrolean Castle", "readers": [13879], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/african_millionaire_2004_librivox/africanmillionaire_04_allen_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2217}, {"section": 5, "title": "The Episode of the Drawn Game", "readers": [5789], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/african_millionaire_2004_librivox/africanmillionaire_05_allen_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2544}, {"section": 6, "title": "The Episode of the German Professor", "readers": [5789], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/african_millionaire_2004_librivox/africanmillionaire_06_allen_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2101}, {"section": 7, "title": "The Episode of the Arrest of the Colonel", "readers": [13774], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/african_millionaire_2004_librivox/africanmillionaire_07_allen_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2388}, {"section": 8, "title": "The Episode of the Seldon Goldmine", "readers": [13879], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/african_millionaire_2004_librivox/africanmillionaire_08_allen_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2127}, {"section": 9, "title": "The Episode of the Japanned Dispatch-Box", "readers": [4174], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/african_millionaire_2004_librivox/africanmillionaire_09_allen_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2300}, {"section": 10, "title": "The Episode of the Game of Poker", "readers": [5789], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/african_millionaire_2004_librivox/africanmillionaire_10_allen_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2208}, {"section": 11, "title": "The Episode of the Bertillon Method", "readers": [5789], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/african_millionaire_2004_librivox/africanmillionaire_11_allen_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2145}, {"section": 12, "title": "The Episode of the Old Bailey", "readers": [5789], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/african_millionaire_2004_librivox/africanmillionaire_12_allen_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2554}]}
