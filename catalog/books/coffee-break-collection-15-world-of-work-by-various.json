{"title": "Coffee Break Collection 15 - World of Work", "description": "This is the fifteenth collection of our \"coffee break\" series, involving public domain works that are between 3 and 15 minutes in length. These are great for study breaks, commutes, workouts, or any time you'd like to hear a whole story and only have a few minutes to devote to listening. The theme for this collection is \"The World of Work\", where work or the workplace is significant. Please note that 'Street Musicians' and 'London Dock' contain language some listeners may find offensive. It is Librivox policy to maintain the original wording.
