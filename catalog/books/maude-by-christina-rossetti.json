{"title": "Maude", "description": "Maude is a novella by Christina Rossetti, written in 1850 but published posthumously in 1897. Considered by scholars to be semi-autobiographical, the protagonist is 15-year-old Maude Foster, a quiet and serious girl who writes poetry that explores the tensions between religious devotion and worldly desires. The text includes several of Rossetti's early verses, which were later published as part of her collections of poetry. - Summary by Elizabeth Klett", "duration": 5114, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "601", "name": "Christina Rossetti"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt33/Maude_1312.jpg", "copyright_year": "1897", "genres": ["Literary Fiction", "Poetry", "Religious Fiction"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Elizabeth Klett"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Elizabeth Klett"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Elizabeth Klett"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "MaryAnn"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Prefatory Note and Part 1", "readers": [1259], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/maude_1312_librivox/maude_1_rossetti_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1687}, {"section": 2, "title": "Part 2", "readers": [1259], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/maude_1312_librivox/maude_2_rossetti_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1613}, {"section": 3, "title": "Part 3", "readers": [1259], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/maude_1312_librivox/maude_3_rossetti_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1814}]}
