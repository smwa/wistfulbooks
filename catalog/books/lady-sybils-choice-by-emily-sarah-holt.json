{"title": "Lady Sybil's Choice", "description": "This historical novel is set in the 1100s in France and Jerusalem, following the First Crusade. Part of the story of Guy of Lusignan (a real historical character) is told through the eyes of his fictional sister, Elaine.\n<br></br>\nGuy travels to the Holy Land to reclaim it from the Saracens. Elaine follows afterward, finding upon arrival that her brother has fallen in love with Sybil, the sister of the leper king of Jerusalem. Queen Sybilla, a real historical character, is surrounded by political intrigue as she prepares to ascend the throne, which threatens her upcoming marriage to Guy of Lusignan.\n<br></br>\nThe story, however, is not primarily about the history of the period, but about the spiritual journey of Elaine to repentance and saving faith in the era of the medieval Church. How will Elaine's frail peace of mind, which depends on earthly things, cope with the looming storms on the horizon? - Summary by TriciaG", "duration": 26488, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "12382", "name": "Emily Sarah Holt"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/ladysybilschoice_1906_librivox/lady_sybils_choice_1906.jpg", "copyright_year": "1879", "genres": ["Historical Fiction", "Christian Fiction"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Adele de Pignerolles"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Kathrine Engan"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Adele de Pignerolles"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Preface", "readers": [7356], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ladysybilschoice_1906_librivox/ladysybilschoice_00_holt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 157}, {"section": 1, "title": "Guy Takes the Cross", "readers": [7356], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ladysybilschoice_1906_librivox/ladysybilschoice_01_holt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2096}, {"section": 2, "title": "Two Surprises for Elaine", "readers": [7356], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ladysybilschoice_1906_librivox/ladysybilschoice_02_holt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1833}, {"section": 3, "title": "All is not Gold that Glitters", "readers": [7356], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ladysybilschoice_1906_librivox/ladysybilschoice_03_holt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2313}, {"section": 4, "title": "A Journey\u2014and the End of it", "readers": [7356], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ladysybilschoice_1906_librivox/ladysybilschoice_04_holt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1937}, {"section": 5, "title": "Curious Notions", "readers": [10261], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ladysybilschoice_1906_librivox/ladysybilschoice_05_holt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1958}, {"section": 6, "title": "The Perversity of People", "readers": [10261], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ladysybilschoice_1906_librivox/ladysybilschoice_06_holt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2142}, {"section": 7, "title": "A Little Cloud Out of the Sea", "readers": [8677], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ladysybilschoice_1906_librivox/ladysybilschoice_07_holt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1385}, {"section": 8, "title": "As Good as Most People", "readers": [8677], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ladysybilschoice_1906_librivox/ladysybilschoice_08_holt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1623}, {"section": 9, "title": "Elaine Finds More than she Expected", "readers": [8677], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ladysybilschoice_1906_librivox/ladysybilschoice_09_holt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1904}, {"section": 10, "title": "Preparing for the Struggle", "readers": [8677], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ladysybilschoice_1906_librivox/ladysybilschoice_10_holt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1769}, {"section": 11, "title": "The Calm Before the Storm", "readers": [13075], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ladysybilschoice_1906_librivox/ladysybilschoice_11_holt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1951}, {"section": 12, "title": "Will She Give Him Up?", "readers": [13075], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ladysybilschoice_1906_librivox/ladysybilschoice_12_holt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1210}, {"section": 13, "title": "Waiting for the Inevitable", "readers": [10995], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ladysybilschoice_1906_librivox/ladysybilschoice_13_holt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1460}, {"section": 14, "title": "Sybil's Choice", "readers": [13072], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ladysybilschoice_1906_librivox/ladysybilschoice_14_holt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1525}, {"section": 15, "title": "Historical Appendix", "readers": [13072], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ladysybilschoice_1906_librivox/ladysybilschoice_15_holt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1225}]}
