{"title": "Pilgrims' Way from Winchester to Canterbury", "description": "\"This account of the Way trodden by the pilgrims of the Middle Ages through the South of England to the shrine of St. Thomas of Canterbury originally appeared in the Art Journal for 1892, with illustrations by Mr. A. Quinton. It was published in the following year as a separate volume, and reprinted in 1895 and 1901. Now by the courtesy of Messrs. Virtue\u2019s representatives, and in response to a continued demand, it appears again in a new and revised form, with the additional attraction of illustrations from original drawings by Mr. Hallam Murray. - Summary adapted from the Preface", "duration": 13266, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "15241", "name": "Julia Mary Cartwright"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/pilgrims_way_2012_librivox/pilgrims_way_jm_2012.jpg", "copyright_year": "1911", "genres": ["Travel & Geography", "Middle Ages/Middle History"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Ann Boulais"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Ann Boulais"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Ann Boulais"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Preface", "readers": [14766], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/pilgrims_way_2012_librivox/pilgrimsway_00_cartwright_64kb.mp3", "duration": 273}, {"section": 1, "title": "The Pilgrims' Way", "readers": [14439], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/pilgrims_way_2012_librivox/pilgrimsway_01_cartwright_64kb.mp3", "duration": 981}, {"section": 2, "title": "Winchester to Alton", "readers": [14439], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/pilgrims_way_2012_librivox/pilgrimsway_02_cartwright_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1298}, {"section": 3, "title": "Alton to Compton", "readers": [14766], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/pilgrims_way_2012_librivox/pilgrimsway_03_cartwright_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1237}, {"section": 4, "title": "Compton to Shalford", "readers": [10159], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/pilgrims_way_2012_librivox/pilgrimsway_04_cartwright_64kb.mp3", "duration": 707}, {"section": 5, "title": "Shalford to Albury", "readers": [10159], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/pilgrims_way_2012_librivox/pilgrimsway_05_cartwright_64kb.mp3", "duration": 740}, {"section": 6, "title": "Shere to Reigate", "readers": [10159], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/pilgrims_way_2012_librivox/pilgrimsway_06_cartwright_64kb.mp3", "duration": 873}, {"section": 7, "title": "Reigate to Chevening", "readers": [10159], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/pilgrims_way_2012_librivox/pilgrimsway_07_cartwright_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1291}, {"section": 8, "title": "Otford to Wrotham", "readers": [12963], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/pilgrims_way_2012_librivox/pilgrimsway_08_cartwright_64kb.mp3", "duration": 767}, {"section": 9, "title": "Wrotham to Hollingbourne", "readers": [12963], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/pilgrims_way_2012_librivox/pilgrimsway_09_cartwright_64kb.mp3", "duration": 899}, {"section": 10, "title": "Hollingbourne to Lenham", "readers": [10159], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/pilgrims_way_2012_librivox/pilgrimsway_10_cartwright_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1014}, {"section": 11, "title": "Charing to Godmersham", "readers": [14439], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/pilgrims_way_2012_librivox/pilgrimsway_11_cartwright_64kb.mp3", "duration": 953}, {"section": 12, "title": "Chilham to Harbledown", "readers": [14809], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/pilgrims_way_2012_librivox/pilgrimsway_12_cartwright_64kb.mp3", "duration": 584}, {"section": 13, "title": "Harbledown to Canterbury", "readers": [14809], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/pilgrims_way_2012_librivox/pilgrimsway_13_cartwright_64kb.mp3", "duration": 567}, {"section": 14, "title": "The Martyr's Shrine", "readers": [14766], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/pilgrims_way_2012_librivox/pilgrimsway_14_cartwright_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1082}]}
