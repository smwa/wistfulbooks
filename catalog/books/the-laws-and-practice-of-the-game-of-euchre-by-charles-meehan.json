{"title": "Laws and Practice of the Game of Euchre. As Adopted by the Washington, D.C. Euchre Club", "description": "Sprinkled with literary quotes and little jests, this is a history of and guide to playing Euchre, with a short portion on playing 5-card draw poker.\nSome of the major differences between the described game and modern Euchre include the following:<br /><br />(1) Today, a game is generally played to 10 points, rather than 5 (and the 5 cards are used for scoring). This will also change the \"playing to the Bridge\" discussion in this work.<br />\n(2) Today, only the 9, 10, J (called \"Knave\" in this work), Q, K, and A cards are used (not the 7 and 8).<br />\n(3) Today, when a player announces they are playing alone, their partner cannot take the privilege of playing alone away from them.<br />\n(4) Often today, when a player orders up their partner (the dealer), the player must play alone. (I've been told, however, that in an evening of progressive euchre, a player can order up their partner without going alone.)<br />\n(5) Lap, Slam, Jambone, and Jamboree are not variations of the game that are common today.<br /><br />\n\nOther minor differences also exist. However, it is still an informative work for those who are new to the game, as well as a look back to the card tables of the previous century.
