{"title": "Letters of John Knox", "description": "The letters... will perhaps more clearly exhibit the temper and character of Knox, than his more elaborate compositions: but to understand the allusions with which they abound, it is necessary to revert to his domestic history while he resided in England. During his stay at Berwick, be contracted an acquaintanceship with Mrs. Bowes, in the course of which, a mutual attachment was formed between him and her daughter Marjory, with the approbation of the mother, who gave her hearty consent to their union. But the intended match was opposed by her husband\u2019s relatives, and especially, by Sir Thomas Bowes, an eminent diplomatist of that period, who seems to have thought, that his family would be degraded, by the alliance of one of its members with an obscure Scot. The expressions of Knox at this unworthy treatment, were those of a man who could combine dignity of feeling and proper self-respect, with the humility and forbearance of a Christian. The marriage was postponed till a better season; but he still continued to address Mrs. Bowes, in his letters, by the endearing title of mother. At last, when no prospect appeared that the obstinate relatives would be brought to compliance, the union was solemnised; and soon after, the accession of Mary followed, and his own flight to the continent. His devoted partner, after sharing in his troubles both in Switzerland and Scotland, died in the latter country, at the close of the year 1560. - Summary by Thomas Thomson", "duration": 4030, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "2717", "name": "John Knox"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/the_letters_of_john_knox_2305_librivox/letters_knox_2305.jpg", "copyright_year": "1845", "genres": ["Christianity - Other"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "InTheDesert"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "InTheDesert"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "lorda"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "pattymarie"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "To his Mother-in-law", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_letters_of_john_knox_2305_librivox/letters_01_knox_64kb.mp3", "duration": 263}, {"section": 2, "title": "To his Mother-in-law", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_letters_of_john_knox_2305_librivox/letters_02_knox_64kb.mp3", "duration": 247}, {"section": 3, "title": "To his Mother-in-law", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_letters_of_john_knox_2305_librivox/letters_03_knox_64kb.mp3", "duration": 101}, {"section": 4, "title": "To his Mother-in-law", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_letters_of_john_knox_2305_librivox/letters_04_knox_64kb.mp3", "duration": 132}, {"section": 5, "title": "To his Mother-in-law", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_letters_of_john_knox_2305_librivox/letters_05_knox_64kb.mp3", "duration": 115}, {"section": 6, "title": "To his Mother-in-law", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_letters_of_john_knox_2305_librivox/letters_06_knox_64kb.mp3", "duration": 89}, {"section": 7, "title": "To his Mother-in-law", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_letters_of_john_knox_2305_librivox/letters_07_knox_64kb.mp3", "duration": 301}, {"section": 8, "title": "To his Mother-in-law", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_letters_of_john_knox_2305_librivox/letters_08_knox_64kb.mp3", "duration": 227}, {"section": 9, "title": "To his Mother-in-law", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_letters_of_john_knox_2305_librivox/letters_09_knox_64kb.mp3", "duration": 581}, {"section": 10, "title": "To his Mother-in-law", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_letters_of_john_knox_2305_librivox/letters_10_knox_64kb.mp3", "duration": 535}, {"section": 11, "title": "From Scotland to his Mother-in-law", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_letters_of_john_knox_2305_librivox/letters_11_knox_64kb.mp3", "duration": 105}, {"section": 12, "title": "From Scotland to his Mother-in-law", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_letters_of_john_knox_2305_librivox/letters_12_knox_64kb.mp3", "duration": 74}, {"section": 13, "title": "To his Sister in his Edinburgh", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_letters_of_john_knox_2305_librivox/letters_13_knox_64kb.mp3", "duration": 336}, {"section": 14, "title": "To his Sister in his Edinburgh", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_letters_of_john_knox_2305_librivox/letters_14_knox_64kb.mp3", "duration": 641}, {"section": 15, "title": "To Mrs. Guthrie, Janet Henderson", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_letters_of_john_knox_2305_librivox/letters_15_knox_64kb.mp3", "duration": 283}]}
