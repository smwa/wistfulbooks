He attended\u00a0Michigan University\u00a0in Ann Arbor, but was expelled along with several others either for his involvement in secret societies\u00a0or for \"too much enterprise in securing subjects for the dissecting room.\"\u00a0After a brief period working in theater, he became a journalist and lecturer.<br /><br />\nFor his published writings he used the pen name \"Q. K. Philander Doesticks, P. B.\", a pseudonym he had first used in university (the full version is \"Queer Kritter Philander Doesticks, Perfect Brick\").
