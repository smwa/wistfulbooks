{"title": "Last Galley, Impressions and Tales", "description": "From the Preface:\r\nI HAVE written \"Impressions and Tales\" upon the title-page of this volume, because I have included within the same cover two styles of work which present an essential difference.<br><br>\r\nThe second half of the collection consists of eight stories, which explain themselves.<br><br>\r\nThe first half is made up of a series of pictures of the past which may be regarded as trial flights towards a larger ideal which I have long had in my mind. It has seemed to me that there is a region between actual story and actual history which has never been adequately exploited. I could imagine, for example, a work dealing with some great historical epoch, and finding its interest not in the happenings to particular individuals, their adventures and their loves, but in the fascination of the actual facts of history them selves. These facts might be coloured with the glamour which the writer of fiction can give, and fictitious characters and conversations might illustrate them; but none the less the actual drama\" of history and not the drama of invention should claim the attention of the reader. I have been tempted some times to try the effect upon a larger scale ; but mean while these short sketches, portraying various crises in the story of the human race, are to be judged as experiments in that direction.\"  Summary by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle", "duration": 28264, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "467", "name": "Sir Arthur Conan Doyle"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/lastgalley_2208_librivox/last_galley_2208.jpg", "copyright_year": "1911", "genres": ["General Fiction", "Historical Fiction"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Ben Tucker"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "MaryAnn"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Christine Rottger"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Preface", "readers": [16758], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/lastgalley_2208_librivox/lastgalley_01_doyle_64kb.mp3", "duration": 107}, {"section": 2, "title": "The Last Galley", "readers": [17384], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/lastgalley_2208_librivox/lastgalley_02_doyle_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1137}, {"section": 3, "title": "The Contest", "readers": [17209], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/lastgalley_2208_librivox/lastgalley_03_doyle_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1157}, {"section": 4, "title": "Through the Veil", "readers": [16550], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/lastgalley_2208_librivox/lastgalley_04_doyle_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1036}, {"section": 5, "title": "An Iconoclast", "readers": [17478], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/lastgalley_2208_librivox/lastgalley_05_doyle_64kb.mp3", "duration": 887}, {"section": 6, "title": "Giant Maximin", "readers": [16209], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/lastgalley_2208_librivox/lastgalley_06_doyle_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2427}, {"section": 7, "title": "The Coming of the Huns", "readers": [15806], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/lastgalley_2208_librivox/lastgalley_07_doyle_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1475}, {"section": 8, "title": "The Last of the Legions", "readers": [5985], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/lastgalley_2208_librivox/lastgalley_08_doyle_64kb.mp3", "duration": 999}, {"section": 9, "title": "The First Cargo", "readers": [17483], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/lastgalley_2208_librivox/lastgalley_09_doyle_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1174}, {"section": 10, "title": "The Home-Coming", "readers": [17099], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/lastgalley_2208_librivox/lastgalley_10_doyle_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1781}, {"section": 11, "title": "The Red Star", "readers": [17463], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/lastgalley_2208_librivox/lastgalley_11_doyle_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1220}, {"section": 12, "title": "The Silver Mirror", "readers": [17530], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/lastgalley_2208_librivox/lastgalley_12_doyle_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1588}, {"section": 13, "title": "The Blighting of Sharkey", "readers": [13075], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/lastgalley_2208_librivox/lastgalley_13_doyle_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2038}, {"section": 14, "title": "The Marriage of the Brigadier", "readers": [14309], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/lastgalley_2208_librivox/lastgalley_14_doyle_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1247}, {"section": 15, "title": "The Lord of Falconbridge Part 1", "readers": [17413], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/lastgalley_2208_librivox/lastgalley_15_doyle_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1122}, {"section": 16, "title": "The Lord of Falconbridge Part 2", "readers": [17413], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/lastgalley_2208_librivox/lastgalley_16_doyle_64kb.mp3", "duration": 676}, {"section": 17, "title": "The Lord of Falconbridge Part 3", "readers": [17413], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/lastgalley_2208_librivox/lastgalley_17_doyle_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1119}, {"section": 18, "title": "Out of the Running", "readers": [17413], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/lastgalley_2208_librivox/lastgalley_18_doyle_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2004}, {"section": 19, "title": "\"De Profundis\"", "readers": [16209], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/lastgalley_2208_librivox/lastgalley_19_doyle_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1628}, {"section": 20, "title": "The Great Brown-Pericord Motor", "readers": [16758], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/lastgalley_2208_librivox/lastgalley_20_doyle_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1038}, {"section": 21, "title": "The Terror of Blue John Gap", "readers": [16758], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/lastgalley_2208_librivox/lastgalley_21_doyle_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2404}]}
