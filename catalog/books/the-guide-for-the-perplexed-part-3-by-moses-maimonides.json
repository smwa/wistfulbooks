The Guide was written in Judeo-Arabic using the Hebrew alphabet in the form of a three-part letter to the Rambam's student, Rabbi Joseph ben Judah of Ceuta. Maimonides says, \"To give a full explanation of the mystic passages of the Bible is contrary to the Law and to reason; besides, my knowledge of them is based on reasoning, not on divine inspiration. I have not received my belief in this respect from any teacher, but it has been formed by what I learnt from Scripture and the utterances of our Sages, and by the philosophical principles which I have adopted. ... I ask you to study attentively the chapters which follow on this sublime, important, and grand subject, which is the pin upon which everything hangs, and the pillar upon which everything rests.\" Translated by Michael Friedl\u00e4nder who was principal of Jews' College.
