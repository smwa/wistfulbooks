{"title": "Notes on The Broads and Rivers of Norfolk and Suffolk", "description": "The Broads area of Norfolk and Suffolk is in the East Anglian region of England. It is the location of Britain's third largest inland waterway system - a system that evolved gradually by natural flooding as a consequence of extensive peat digging during mediaeval times in this vast low-lying area.<br /><br />\n\nThe Broads (or lakes) and rivers were used for centuries to transport goods and passengers between various inland locations and the coastal ports of Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft. During the nineteenth century, the area started to become popular as a boating holiday destination. This book, first published in 1887, records the events of the author\u2019s holiday on the Broads aboard his own eight ton cutter \u2013 The Buttercup.<br /><br />\n\nThe author, along with a friend (named variously, Jack or John) and his \u2019man\u2019, George sail the yacht to various places of interest around the Broads. With the help of an experienced sea captain, the group leave the Broads for a day and\nsail the Buttercup down the Suffolk coast past Southwold and through Sole Bay to see the remains of the ancient capitol of East Anglia at Dunwich. <br /><br />\n\nSo, if the thought of being out on the water, sailing and discovering all sorts of interesting places is something that \u2018rocks your boat\u2019 then please join me if you will, on another auditory cruise around these unique waterways through \nexpansive landscapes under wide open skies.  -
