{"title": "Art of the Moving Picture", "description": "\"This 1922 book by poet and sometime cultural critic Vachel Lindsay might have been the first to treat the then-new medium of moving pictures as an art form, one that was potentially as rich, complex, mysterious as far older ones, and whose physical and aesthetic properties were only starting to be understood. The highlight of the book might be \u201cThe Motion Picture of Fairy Splendor,\u201d which examines the relationship between film storytelling, magic, myths, legends and bedtime stories. It\u2019s discombobulating, in a good way, to read Lindsay\u2019s attempts to grapple with what, precisely, cinema is. Being supposedly sophisticated 21st century people, we all feel as though we know what cinema is, and don\u2019t need to have the basics explained to us, but this is really just vanity and ignorance talking. Bottom line: You haven\u2019t really, seriously thought about movies \u2014 what they are, and what they can and cannot do, and become \u2014 until you\u2019ve read this book.\" (Salon.com)", "duration": 25609, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "2123", "name": "Vachel Lindsay"}], "coverArt": "http://archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt19/Art_Moving_Picture_1209.jpg", "copyright_year": "1915", "genres": ["*Non-fiction", "Art", "Design & Architecture"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Chuck Williamson"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Guero"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Rapunzelina"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "DEDICATION AND A WORD FROM THE DIRECTOR OF THE DENVER ART ASSOCIATION", "readers": [7079], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/artmovingpicture_1206_librivox/artofthemovingpicture_00_lindsay_64kb.mp3", "duration": 536}, {"section": 1, "title": "BOOK I - THE GENERAL PHOTOPLAY SITUATION IN AMERICA, JANUARY 1, 1922", "readers": [7079], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/artmovingpicture_1206_librivox/artofthemovingpicture_01_lindsay_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2573}, {"section": 2, "title": "BOOK II - THE UNCHALLENGED OUTLINE OF PHOTOPLAY CRITICAL METHOD / CHAPTER I - THE POINT OF VIEW", "readers": [4331], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/artmovingpicture_1206_librivox/artofthemovingpicture_02_lindsay_64kb.mp3", "duration": 475}, {"section": 3, "title": "CHAPTER II - THE PHOTOPLAY OF ACTION", "readers": [4174], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/artmovingpicture_1206_librivox/artofthemovingpicture_03_lindsay_64kb.mp3", "duration": 807}, {"section": 4, "title": "CHAPTER III  - THE INTIMATE PHOTOPLAY", "readers": [6548], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/artmovingpicture_1206_librivox/artofthemovingpicture_04_lindsay_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1068}, {"section": 5, "title": "CHAPTER IV - THE MOTION PICTURE OF FAIRY SPLENDOR", "readers": [6548], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/artmovingpicture_1206_librivox/artofthemovingpicture_05_lindsay_64kb.mp3", "duration": 661}, {"section": 6, "title": "CHAPTER V - THE PICTURE OF CROWD SPLENDOR", "readers": [25], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/artmovingpicture_1206_librivox/artofthemovingpicture_06_lindsay_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1131}, {"section": 7, "title": "CHAPTER VI - PATRIOTIC SPLENDOR", "readers": [5118], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/artmovingpicture_1206_librivox/artofthemovingpicture_07_lindsay_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1558}, {"section": 8, "title": "CHAPTER VII - RELIGIOUS SPLENDOR", "readers": [7401], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/artmovingpicture_1206_librivox/artofthemovingpicture_08_lindsay_64kb.mp3", "duration": 846}, {"section": 9, "title": "CHAPTER VIII - SCULPTURE-IN-MOTION", "readers": [6482], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/artmovingpicture_1206_librivox/artofthemovingpicture_09_lindsay_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1468}, {"section": 10, "title": "CHAPTER IX - PAINTING-IN-MOTION", "readers": [6482], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/artmovingpicture_1206_librivox/artofthemovingpicture_10_lindsay_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1236}, {"section": 11, "title": "CHAPTER X - FURNITURE, TRAPPINGS, AND INVENTIONS IN MOTION", "readers": [5672], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/artmovingpicture_1206_librivox/artofthemovingpicture_11_lindsay_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1447}, {"section": 12, "title": "CHAPTER XI - ARCHITECTURE-IN-MOTION", "readers": [6754], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/artmovingpicture_1206_librivox/artofthemovingpicture_12_lindsay_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1126}, {"section": 13, "title": "CHAPTER XII - THIRTY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE PHOTOPLAYS AND THE STAGE", "readers": [2624], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/artmovingpicture_1206_librivox/artofthemovingpicture_13_lindsay_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1396}, {"section": 14, "title": "CHAPTER XIII - HIEROGLYPHICS", "readers": [6548], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/artmovingpicture_1206_librivox/artofthemovingpicture_14_lindsay_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1437}, {"section": 15, "title": "BOOK III.
