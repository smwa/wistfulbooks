{"title": "Spinning-Wheel Stories", "description": "A group of stories-within-a-story, told in the classic Louisa May Alcott style.<br/><br/>\n\n<i>\"I've a little cold,\" said the old lady, \"and am too hoarse for talking, my dears; but Aunt Elinor has looked up a parcel of old tales that I've told her at different times and which she has written down. You will like to hear her reading better than my dull way of telling them, and I can help Minnie and Lotty with their work, for I see they are bent on learning to spin.\"<br/><br/>\n\nThe young folk were well pleased with grandma's proposal; for Aunt Nell was a favorite with all, being lively and kind and fond of children, and the only maiden aunt in the family. Now, she smilingly produced a faded old portfolio, and, turning over a little pile of manuscripts, said in her pleasant way:<br/><br/>\n\n\"Here are all sorts, picked up in my travels at home and abroad; and in order to suit all of you, I have put the names on slips of paper into this basket, and each can draw one in turn. Does that please my distinguished audience?\"</i><br/><br/>\n\n(Summary by TriciaG and from the book)", "duration": 25191, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "93", "name": "Louisa May Alcott"}], "coverArt": "http://archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt25/Spinning-Wheel_Stories_1211.jpg", "copyright_year": "1884", "genres": ["Children's Fiction"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "TriciaG"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "TriciaG"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Debbie"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "01 - Grandma's Story", "readers": [7556], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/spinningwheel_stories_1211_librivox/spinningwheelstories_01_alcott_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2025}, {"section": 2, "title": "02 - Tabby's Table-Cloth", "readers": [7789], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/spinningwheel_stories_1211_librivox/spinningwheelstories_02_alcott_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1911}, {"section": 3, "title": "03 - Eli's Education", "readers": [6914], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/spinningwheel_stories_1211_librivox/spinningwheelstories_03_alcott_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2242}, {"section": 4, "title": "04 - Onawandah", "readers": [7789], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/spinningwheel_stories_1211_librivox/spinningwheelstories_04_alcott_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1773}, {"section": 5, "title": "05 - Little Things", "readers": [6914], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/spinningwheel_stories_1211_librivox/spinningwheelstories_05_alcott_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2054}, {"section": 6, "title": "06 - The Banner of Beaumanoir", "readers": [7823], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/spinningwheel_stories_1211_librivox/spinningwheelstories_06_alcott_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2306}, {"section": 7, "title": "07 - Jerseys; or, the Girl's Ghost", "readers": [7416], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/spinningwheel_stories_1211_librivox/spinningwheelstories_07_alcott_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2404}, {"section": 8, "title": "08 - The Little House in the Garden", "readers": [7387], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/spinningwheel_stories_1211_librivox/spinningwheelstories_08_alcott_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2389}, {"section": 9, "title": "09 - Daisy's Jewel-Box, and How She Filled It", "readers": [7584], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/spinningwheel_stories_1211_librivox/spinningwheelstories_09_alcott_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1927}, {"section": 10, "title": "10 - Corny's Catamount", "readers": [7416], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/spinningwheel_stories_1211_librivox/spinningwheelstories_10_alcott_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2103}, {"section": 11, "title": "11 - The Cooking-Class", "readers": [7026], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/spinningwheel_stories_1211_librivox/spinningwheelstories_11_alcott_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1842}, {"section": 12, "title": "12 - The Hare and the Tortoise", "readers": [7246], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/spinningwheel_stories_1211_librivox/spinningwheelstories_12_alcott_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2215}]}
