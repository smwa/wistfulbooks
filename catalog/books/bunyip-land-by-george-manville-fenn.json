{"title": "Bunyip Land", "description": "Joe Carstairs is a boy on a farm in Australia. His father is a keen naturalist who, some years before had set off for New Guinea in search of specimens, and never been heard of again. Joe is old enough to mount a search expedition, and takes with him a local doctor and an aboriginal worker on his farm. They find themselves joined by a stowaway, Jimmy, whose father is a squatter (farmer) nearby, together with his dog, Gyp. <br /><br />\nThis team sets off, arrive in New Guinea, hire some more porters, and travel guided by some sixth sense straight to where Mr. Carstairs has been kept a prisoner, along with another Englishman, whose mind has gone, under the stress of his imprisonment. <br /><br />\nThere are the usual close shaves and tense moments, but finally they achieve their end, and return home triumphantly.", "duration": 41568, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "2870",
