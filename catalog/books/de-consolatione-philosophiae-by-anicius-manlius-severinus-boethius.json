{"title": "Consolatione Philosophiae", "description": "Consolation of Philosophy (Latin: Consolatio Philosophiae) is a philosophical work by Boethius written in about the year 524 AD. It has been described as the single most important and influential work in the West in medieval and early Renaissance Christianity, and is also the last great work that can be called Classical.<br /><br />\nConsolation of Philosophy was written during Boethius' one year imprisonment while awaiting trial, and eventual horrific execution, for the crime of treason by Ostrogothic King Theodoric the Great. Boethius was at the very heights of power in Rome and was brought down by treachery. It was from this experience he was inspired to write a philosophical book from prison reflecting on how a lord's favor could change so quickly and why friends would turn against him. It has been described as \u201cby far the most interesting example of prison literature the world has ever seen.\u201d<br /><br />\nThe Consolation of Philosophy stands, by its note of fatalism and its affinities with the Christian doctrine of humility, midway between the heathen philosophy of Seneca the Younger and the later Christian philosophy of consolation represented by Thomas Aquinas.<br /><br />\nThe book is heavily influenced by Plato and his dialogues (as was Boethius himself).  - Summary by Wikipedia", "duration": 18270, "language": "Latin", "authors": [{"id": "4104", "name": " Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/de_consolatione_philosophiae_1606_librivox/consolatione_philosophiae_1607.jpg", "copyright_year": "1871", "genres": ["Philosophy"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "bedwere"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "bedwere"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Ann Boulais"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Ann Boulais"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Liber I: a principio usque ad prosam III inclusive", "readers": [7860], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/de_consolatione_philosophiae_1606_librivox/consolationephilosophiae_01_boethius_64kb.mp3", "duration": 908}, {"section": 2, "title": "Liber I: a metro IV usque ad finem", "readers": [7860], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/de_consolatione_philosophiae_1606_librivox/consolationephilosophiae_02_boethius_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1732}, {"section": 3, "title": "Liber II: a principio usque ad metrum IV inclusive", "readers": [7860], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/de_consolatione_philosophiae_1606_librivox/consolationephilosophiae_03_boethius_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1549}, {"section": 4, "title": "Liber II: a prosa V usque ad finem", "readers": [7860], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/de_consolatione_philosophiae_1606_librivox/consolationephilosophiae_04_boethius_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1783}, {"section": 5, "title": "Liber III: a principio usque ad metrum V inclusive", "readers": [7860], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/de_consolatione_philosophiae_1606_librivox/consolationephilosophiae_05_boethius_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1567}, {"section": 6, "title": "Liber III: a prosa VI usque ad metrum IX inclusive", "readers": [7860], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/de_consolatione_philosophiae_1606_librivox/consolationephilosophiae_06_boethius_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1231}, {"section": 7, "title": "Liber III: a prosa X usque ad finem", "readers": [7860], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/de_consolatione_philosophiae_1606_librivox/consolationephilosophiae_07_boethius_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2112}, {"section": 8, "title": "Liber IV: a principio usque ad metrum IV inclusive", "readers": [7860], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/de_consolatione_philosophiae_1606_librivox/consolationephilosophiae_08_boethius_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2347}, {"section": 9, "title": "Liber IV: a prosa V usque ad finem", "readers": [7860], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/de_consolatione_philosophiae_1606_librivox/consolationephilosophiae_09_boethius_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1827}, {"section": 10, "title": "Liber V: a principio usque ad metrum III inclusive", "readers": [7860], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/de_consolatione_philosophiae_1606_librivox/consolationephilosophiae_10_boethius_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1234}, {"section": 11, "title": "Liber V: a prosa IV usque ad finem", "readers": [7860], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/de_consolatione_philosophiae_1606_librivox/consolationephilosophiae_11_boethius_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1980}]}
