Chesterton has been called the \"prince of paradox\". Time magazine, in a review of a biography of Chesterton, observed of his writing style: \"Whenever possible Chesterton made his points with popular sayings, proverbs, allegories\u2014first carefully turning them inside out.\"  For example, Chesterton wrote \"Thieves respect property. They merely wish the property to become their property that they may more perfectly respect it.\" (Summary by Wikipedia )</p> ", "duration": 2327, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "426", "name": "G.
