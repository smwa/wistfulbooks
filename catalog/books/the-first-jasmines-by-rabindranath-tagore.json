{"title": "First Jasmines", "description": "Rabindranath Tagore, was a Bengali polymath who reshaped Bengali literature and music, as well as Indian art with Contextual Modernism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Author of Gitanjali and its \"profoundly sensitive, fresh and beautiful verse\", he became the first non-European to win the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1913. In translation his poetry was viewed as spiritual and mercurial; however, his \"elegant prose and magical poetry\" remain largely unknown outside Bengal. Tagore introduced new prose and verse forms and the use of colloquial language into Bengali literature, thereby freeing it from traditional models based on classical Sanskrit. He was highly influential in introducing the best of Indian culture to the West and vice versa, and he is generally regarded as the outstanding creative artist of the modern Indian subcontinent. - Summary by Wikipedia", "duration": 1331, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "568", "name": "Rabindranath Tagore"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/first_jasmines_1505.poem_librivox/firstjasmines_1505.jpg", "copyright_year": "1913", "genres": ["Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "The First Jasmines - Read by AJC", "readers": [2854], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/first_jasmines_1505.poem_librivox/firstjasmines_tagore_ajc_64kb.mp3", "duration": 116}, {"section": 2, "title": "The First Jasmines - Read by ALP", "readers": [4705], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/first_jasmines_1505.poem_librivox/firstjasmines_tagore_alp_64kb.mp3", "duration": 85}, {"section": 3, "title": "The First Jasmines - Read by BK", "readers": [8786], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/first_jasmines_1505.poem_librivox/firstjasmines_tagore_bk_64kb.mp3", "duration": 95}, {"section": 4, "title": "The First Jasmines - Read by DL", "readers": [2911], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/first_jasmines_1505.poem_librivox/firstjasmines_tagore_dl_64kb.mp3", "duration": 85}, {"section": 5, "title": "The First Jasmines - Read by EL", "readers": [9872], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/first_jasmines_1505.poem_librivox/firstjasmines_tagore_el_64kb.mp3", "duration": 97}, {"section": 6, "title": "The First Jasmines - Read by GG", "readers": [8011], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/first_jasmines_1505.poem_librivox/firstjasmines_tagore_gg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 101}, {"section": 7, "title": "The First Jasmines - Read by IK", "readers": [7785], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/first_jasmines_1505.poem_librivox/firstjasmines_tagore_ik_64kb.mp3", "duration": 93}, {"section": 8, "title": "The First Jasmines - Read by JM", "readers": [9902], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/first_jasmines_1505.poem_librivox/firstjasmines_tagore_jm_64kb.mp3", "duration": 81}, {"section": 9, "title": "The First Jasmines - Read by LAH", "readers": [1212], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/first_jasmines_1505.poem_librivox/firstjasmines_tagore_lah_64kb.mp3", "duration": 79}, {"section": 10, "title": "The First Jasmines - Read by LLW", "readers": [4738], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/first_jasmines_1505.poem_librivox/firstjasmines_tagore_llw_64kb.mp3", "duration": 112}, {"section": 11, "title": "The First Jasmines - Read by MK", "readers": [8051], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/first_jasmines_1505.poem_librivox/firstjasmines_tagore_mk_64kb.mp3", "duration": 99}, {"section": 12, "title": "The First Jasmines - Read by NB", "readers": [6965], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/first_jasmines_1505.poem_librivox/firstjasmines_tagore_nb_64kb.mp3", "duration": 86}, {"section": 13, "title": "The First Jasmines - Read by PY", "readers": [167], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/first_jasmines_1505.poem_librivox/firstjasmines_tagore_py_64kb.mp3", "duration": 96}, {"section": 14, "title": "The First Jasmines - Read by RC", "readers": [9331], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/first_jasmines_1505.poem_librivox/firstjasmines_tagore_rc_64kb.mp3", "duration": 106}]}
