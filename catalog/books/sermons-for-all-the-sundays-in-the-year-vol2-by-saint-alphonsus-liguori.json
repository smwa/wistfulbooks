{"title": "Sermons for all the Sundays in the year (Sermons XXVI - XLIII)", "description": "These are the sermons of St. Alphonsus Liguori, who was an Italian Catholic bishop, and theologian. He is famous for founding the Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer (the Redemptorists), and for his writings, which are among the most widely read in the Catholic world. His best-known works are The Glories of Mary and The Way of the Cross (still used in parishes for Lenten devotions).<br><br>\r\n\r\nHe was canonized in 1839 and proclaimed a Doctor of the Church in 1871.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe preface to these sermons (written by St. Alphonsus):<br><br>\r\n\r\nThis work is entitled, ABRIDGED SERMONS FOR ALL THE SUNDAYS IN THE YEAR. They are called Abridged Sermons, because, although each contains abundant matter for a sermon, the sentiments are briefly expressed\u2014not, however, so briefly as to render the sense obscure. Hence the work may be used for spiritual lectures. Diffuseness has been purposely avoided, that the preacher may extend the subject treated in the way which may appear best to him. A preacher will scarce ever deliver, with zeal and warmth, sentiments which he has not made in some manner his own. Hence the matter of each sermon has been condensed into a small compass, that the preacher may extend it according to his pleasure, and thus make it his own.<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn each sermon there are many passages from the Scriptures and Holy Fathers, and a variety of reflections\u2014perhaps too many for a single discourse\u2014that the reader may select what will be most pleasing to him. The style is easy and simple, and therefore calculated to render the preaching of the Divine Word conducive to the salvation of souls.
