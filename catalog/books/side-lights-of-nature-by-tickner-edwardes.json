{"title": "Side-lights of Nature in Quill and Crayon", "description": "In the following pages no attempt has been made to bring to light any new fact in Natural History. The papers are laid before the notice of the reader for as much, or as little, as they are worth; and lay claim to no more importance than may be attached to them as earnest records of happy solitary rambles\u2014in storm or sunshine, year in and year out\u2014among the green woods and meadowlands of Kent and Sussex. (From the book\u2019s preface by Edward Tickner Edwardes).\r\n\r\nSide-Lights of Nature was originally published in 1898 and was the first book authored by Tickner Edwardes. It was reprinted in 1912.  Written in the same unique perceptive and insightful style that was to be the distinguishing feature in his subsequent books, Tickner Edwardes paints a picture for the reader (and also the listener) of the innumerable connections he observes between the natural environment, local wildlife and the beautiful English countryside. The book contains many illustrations that complement the chapters and reflect what country life was like in the counties of Kent and Sussex in Southern England at the turn of the last century. - Summary by Steve C", "duration": 14298, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "11276", "name": "Tickner Edwardes"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/sidelightsofnature_2511_librivox/sidelights_of_nature_2511.jpg", "copyright_year": "1912", "genres": ["Nature"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Steve C"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Steve C"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "DaveC"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "DaveC"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Preface, Chapters 1 & 2", "readers": [7389], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/sidelightsofnature_2511_librivox/sidelightsnature_01_edwardes_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1770}, {"section": 2, "title": "Chapters 3 & 4", "readers": [7389], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/sidelightsofnature_2511_librivox/sidelightsnature_02_edwardes_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1819}, {"section": 3, "title": "Chapters 5 & 6", "readers": [7389], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/sidelightsofnature_2511_librivox/sidelightsnature_03_edwardes_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1678}, {"section": 4, "title": "Chapters 7, 8 & 9", "readers": [7389], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/sidelightsofnature_2511_librivox/sidelightsnature_04_edwardes_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1666}, {"section": 5, "title": "Chapters 10, 11 & 12", "readers": [7389], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/sidelightsofnature_2511_librivox/sidelightsnature_05_edwardes_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2108}, {"section": 6, "title": "Chapters 13 & 14", "readers": [7389], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/sidelightsofnature_2511_librivox/sidelightsnature_06_edwardes_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1698}, {"section": 7, "title": "Chapters 15 & 16", "readers": [7389], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/sidelightsofnature_2511_librivox/sidelightsnature_07_edwardes_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1675}, {"section": 8, "title": "Chapters 17 & 18", "readers": [7389], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/sidelightsofnature_2511_librivox/sidelightsnature_08_edwardes_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1884}]}
