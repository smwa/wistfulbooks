{"title": "Northern Trails, Book 1", "description": "\"In the original preface to \"Northern Trails\" the author stated that, with the solitary exception of the salmon's life in the sea after he vanishes from human sight, every incident recorded here is founded squarely upon personal and accurate observation of animal life and habits. I now repeat and emphasize that statement. Even when the observations are, for the reader's sake, put into the form of a connected story, there is not one trait or habit mentioned which is not true to animal life.\"\n-- William J. Long, from the book's preface.\n\nNorthern Trails, Book I, is one of the last two books in the \"Wood Folk\" series by William J. Long. It has six stories, with wolves, Indians, caribou, and much more. - Summary by Kangaroo692", "duration": 11299, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "10014", "name": "William J.
