{"title": "Narrative of an Expedition to the Shores of the Arctic Sea in 1846 and 1847", "description": "After the bizarre death of Thomas Simpson, Dr. John Rae was chosen to complete the survey of the Northwest Passage, linking the work of Simpson and Peter Dease with the previously known country to the east.  Rae was recognized for his endurance and skill in wilderness travel, adopting the methods of the native peoples often eschewed by other European explorers.  This is his report on the initial work in the years 1846-47.  The final link was made to the surveys of Simpson and Dease several years later (1848-51). - Summary by Fritz", "duration": 18963, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "12919", "name": "John Rae"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/narrative_of_an_expedition_to_the_arctic_sea_1711_librivox/narrative_expedition_shores_1711.jpg", "copyright_year": "1850", "genres": ["Genre(s):"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Phil Schempf"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Phil Schempf"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "DaveC"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "DaveC"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Chapter 1", "readers": [8576], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/narrative_of_an_expedition_to_the_arctic_sea_1711_librivox/expeditiontotheshoresofthearcticsea_01_rae_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1779}, {"section": 2, "title": "Chapter 2", "readers": [8576], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/narrative_of_an_expedition_to_the_arctic_sea_1711_librivox/expeditiontotheshoresofthearcticsea_02_rae_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1928}, {"section": 3, "title": "Chapter 3", "readers": [8576], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/narrative_of_an_expedition_to_the_arctic_sea_1711_librivox/expeditiontotheshoresofthearcticsea_03_rae_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2229}, {"section": 4, "title": "Chapter 4", "readers": [8576], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/narrative_of_an_expedition_to_the_arctic_sea_1711_librivox/expeditiontotheshoresofthearcticsea_04_rae_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1875}, {"section": 5, "title": "Chapter 5", "readers": [8576], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/narrative_of_an_expedition_to_the_arctic_sea_1711_librivox/expeditiontotheshoresofthearcticsea_05_rae_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1437}, {"section": 6, "title": "Chapter 6", "readers": [8576], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/narrative_of_an_expedition_to_the_arctic_sea_1711_librivox/expeditiontotheshoresofthearcticsea_06_rae_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3854}, {"section": 7, "title": "Chapter 7", "readers": [8576], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/narrative_of_an_expedition_to_the_arctic_sea_1711_librivox/expeditiontotheshoresofthearcticsea_07_rae_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2685}, {"section": 8, "title": "Chapter 8", "readers": [8576], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/narrative_of_an_expedition_to_the_arctic_sea_1711_librivox/expeditiontotheshoresofthearcticsea_08_rae_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1214}, {"section": 9, "title": "Chapter 9", "readers": [8576], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/narrative_of_an_expedition_to_the_arctic_sea_1711_librivox/expeditiontotheshoresofthearcticsea_09_rae_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1962}]}
