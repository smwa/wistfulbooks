{"title": "Adaptation", "description": "In 1960 when this was published, the Cold War was at its height.  Communism and Free Enterprise (Democracy) were locked in a ferocious struggle to prove that their political ideology was the best form of government for human kind.  No holds were barred in this fight; propaganda was poured forth by both sides in a constant push to be seen as better, more progressive, more productive. Nuclear war was a constant threat. I know, I lived through that time. Thankfully the world came through that stressful time without a hot war but the question was not really settled: which is the better system?  This story explores that question.  \"Hardly had man solved his basic problems on the planet of his origin than he began to fumble into space. Barely a century had elapsed in the exploration of the Solar System than he began to grope for the stars.  And suddenly, with an all but religious zeal, mankind conceived its fantasy dream of populating the galaxy.\"  summary by Phil chenevert and the author", "duration": 10510, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "57", "name": "Mack Reynolds"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/adaptation_2106_librivox/adaption_2106.jpg", "copyright_year": "0", "genres": ["Science Fiction"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "April6090"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Part 1", "readers": [5717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/adaptation_2106_librivox/adaptation_01_reynolds_64kb.mp3", "duration": 721}, {"section": 2, "title": "Part 2", "readers": [5717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/adaptation_2106_librivox/adaptation_02_reynolds_64kb.mp3", "duration": 949}, {"section": 3, "title": "Part 3", "readers": [5717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/adaptation_2106_librivox/adaptation_03_reynolds_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1466}, {"section": 4, "title": "Part 4", "readers": [5717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/adaptation_2106_librivox/adaptation_04_reynolds_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1339}, {"section": 5, "title": "Part 5", "readers": [5717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/adaptation_2106_librivox/adaptation_05_reynolds_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1016}, {"section": 6, "title": "Part 6", "readers": [5717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/adaptation_2106_librivox/adaptation_06_reynolds_64kb.mp3", "duration": 889}, {"section": 7, "title": "Part 7", "readers": [5717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/adaptation_2106_librivox/adaptation_07_reynolds_64kb.mp3", "duration": 507}, {"section": 8, "title": "Part 8", "readers": [5717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/adaptation_2106_librivox/adaptation_08_reynolds_64kb.mp3", "duration": 967}, {"section": 9, "title": "Part 9", "readers": [5717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/adaptation_2106_librivox/adaptation_09_reynolds_64kb.mp3", "duration": 565}, {"section": 10, "title": "Part 10", "readers": [5717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/adaptation_2106_librivox/adaptation_10_reynolds_64kb.mp3", "duration": 591}, {"section": 11, "title": "Part  11", "readers": [5717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/adaptation_2106_librivox/adaptation_11_reynolds_64kb.mp3", "duration": 636}, {"section": 12, "title": "Part 12", "readers": [5717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/adaptation_2106_librivox/adaptation_12_reynolds_64kb.mp3", "duration": 864}]}
