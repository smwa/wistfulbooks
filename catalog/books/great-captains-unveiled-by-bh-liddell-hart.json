{"title": "Great Captains Unveiled", "description": "\"Great Captains Unveiled\" by the eminent military historian Sir Basil Liddell Hart comprises the biographies of six commanders who shaped the development of strategy and tactics. Of the 13th century Mongols, Genghis Khan and his successor-general, Sabutai, the author writes: \"Quality rather than quantity was the secret of their amazingly rapid sequence of successes.\" Careful planning, promotion by merit, tactical precision in battle, good military intelligence, and a highly mobile cavalry were integral to the establishment of the world's largest empire. Liddell Hart then traces the careers of the \"Mareschal de Saxe-Military Prophet, Gustavus Adophus-Founder of Modern War, Wallenstein--the Enigma of History, and General Wolfe-Grandsire of the United States.\" (Summary by Pamela Nagami, M.D.)", "duration": 25249, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "18835", "name": "B.
