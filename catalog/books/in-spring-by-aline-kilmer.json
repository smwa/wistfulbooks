In their short marriage, lasting 10 years, her husband had achieved fame as a poet, literary critic and among Catholic circles as America's most prominent Catholic writer. After his death in World War I, Aline began publishing her own poetry and a few children's books. Today, her work is largely forgotten. - Summary by Wikipedia", "duration": 697, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "9388", "name": "Aline Kilmer"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/in_spring_1603.poem_librivox/inspring_1603.jpg", "copyright_year": "1919", "genres": ["Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Twinkle"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "In Spring - Read by ACD", "readers": [10717], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/in_spring_1603.poem_librivox/inspring_kilmer_acd_64kb.mp3", "duration": 36}, {"section": 2, "title": "In Spring - Read by ALP", "readers": [4705], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/in_spring_1603.poem_librivox/inspring_kilmer_alp_64kb.mp3", "duration": 52}, {"section": 3, "title": "In Spring - Read by BK", "readers": [8786], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/in_spring_1603.poem_librivox/inspring_kilmer_bk_64kb.mp3", "duration": 60}, {"section": 4, "title": "In Spring - Read by DL", "readers": [2911], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/in_spring_1603.poem_librivox/inspring_kilmer_dl_64kb.mp3", "duration": 48}, {"section": 5, "title": "In Spring - Read by EL", "readers": [9872], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/in_spring_1603.poem_librivox/inspring_kilmer_el_64kb.mp3", "duration": 57}, {"section": 6, "title": "In Spring - Read by GG", "readers": [8011], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/in_spring_1603.poem_librivox/inspring_kilmer_gg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 63}, {"section": 7, "title": "In Spring - Read by IK", "readers": [7785], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/in_spring_1603.poem_librivox/inspring_kilmer_ik_64kb.mp3", "duration": 59}, {"section": 8, "title": "In Spring - Read by JEF", "readers": [10494], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/in_spring_1603.poem_librivox/inspring_kilmer_jef_64kb.mp3", "duration": 53}, {"section": 9, "title": "In Spring - Read by LAH", "readers": [1212], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/in_spring_1603.poem_librivox/inspring_kilmer_lah_64kb.mp3", "duration": 49}, {"section": 10, "title": "In Spring - Read by LLW", "readers": [4738], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/in_spring_1603.poem_librivox/inspring_kilmer_llw_64kb.mp3", "duration": 60}, {"section": 11, "title": "In Spring - Read by MK", "readers": [8051], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/in_spring_1603.poem_librivox/inspring_kilmer_mk_64kb.mp3", "duration": 59}, {"section": 12, "title": "In Spring - Read by SS", "readers": [9123], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/in_spring_1603.poem_librivox/inspring_kilmer_ss_64kb.mp3", "duration": 55}, {"section": 13, "title": "In Spring - Read by T", "readers": [10615], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/in_spring_1603.poem_librivox/inspring_kilmer_t_64kb.mp3", "duration": 46}]}
