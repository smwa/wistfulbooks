{"title": "Comic English Grammar", "description": "This is a basic grammar, treating of the parts of speech, syntax, versification, pronunciation and punctuation. <br /><br /> The listener is warned that there is quite a dated feel about this little grammar as the author, in keeping with the times (1840), is a frightful snob about social classes, scathing about 'vulgar speech' and also sometimes quite rude about American turns of phrase. The author is not remotely as comical as he thinks he is, but it has its moments.
