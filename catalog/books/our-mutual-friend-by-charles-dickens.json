{"title": "Our Mutual Friend", "description": "Dickens' last complete novel was published serially 1864-5. It begins with an intriguing fortune offered to John Harmon by his late father, a rich dust contractor, in his will. <br><br>To receive the money, John must marry a certain Bella Wilfer who he does not know from Eve. He is returning from the exile enforced by his father and confides in a ship's mate who attempts to murder him. The mate gets killed instead, leaving one inconvenient corpse. Because John is considered dead (the body is found with his papers), the money passes to Mr Boffin, old Harmon's foreman. Harmon adopts Bella and John comes into his employ disguised as John Rokesmith. Bella does not fall for John but through kindly Boffin's contrivances learns to hate money and fall for her suitor under his false name. Eventually she learns of his true identity as the Boffins had previously, and the villainous one-legged Silas Wegg's plot to blackmail Mr Boffin is brought to light.<br><br> There is also a story running behind the main plot about a certain Eugene Wrayburn and his love for Lizzie Hexam, and his rival's attempt to murder him. The two plots are only really connected through the waterside murders but it allows Dickens to indulge in an extremely socially diverse cast of characters. (Summary written by Alan Chant).", "duration": 120364, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "91", "name": "Charles Dickens"}], "coverArt": "https://www.archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt/Our_Mutual_Friend_1003.jpg", "copyright_year": "1865", "genres": ["General Fiction"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Ophelia Darcy"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "David Barnes"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "bk1_01 - Book the First - Chapter 01 ON THE LOOK OUT", "readers": [57], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/our_mutual_friend_0707_librivox/ourmutualfriend_bk1_01_dickens_64kb.mp3", "duration": 629}, {"section": 2, "title": "bk1_02 - Book the First - Chapter 02 THE MAN FROM SOMEWHERE", "readers": [56], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/our_mutual_friend_0707_librivox/ourmutualfriend_bk1_02_dickens_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1684}, {"section": 3, "title": "bk1_03 - Book the First - Chapter 03 ANOTHER MAN", "readers": [483], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/our_mutual_friend_0707_librivox/ourmutualfriend_bk1_03_dickens_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1806}, {"section": 4, "title": "bk1_04 - Book the First - Chapter 04 THE R.
