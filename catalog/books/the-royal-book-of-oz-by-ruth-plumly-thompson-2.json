{"title": "Royal Book of Oz (version 3)", "description": "\"Of course, we all knew the Scarecrow was a very fine fellow, but surely we never guessed he ascended from an emperor. Most of us descend from our ancestors, but the Scarecrow really ASCENDED.\n\nThe Scarecrow had a most exciting and adventurous time on the Silver Isle and Dorothy and the Cowardly Lion just ran out of one adventure into another trying to rescue him. They made some charming new friends in their travels\u2014Sir Hokus of Pokes, the Doubtful Dromedary, and the Comfortable Camel. You'll find them very unusual and likable. They have the same peculiar, delightful and informal natures that we love in all the queer Oz people.\" From the introduction.   When Frank Baum died, he left notes for the next book in the Oz series and they were used to write this delightful story.  - Summary by Introduction and Phil Chenevert", "duration": 19649, "language":
