{"title": "Paulownia: Seven Stories from Contemporary Japanese Writers", "description": "Paulownia is a collection of seven stories by three Japanese authors from the late 19th and early 20th century. <br><br>\n\n<b>Mori \u014cgai</b> was an army surgeon who was sent to study in Germany, where he developed an interest in Western literature. His most famous work is <em>The Wild Geese (Gan)</em>. This collection contains his short stories <em>Takase Bune</em>, <em>Hanako</em>, and <em>The Pier</em>. <br> <br> \n\n<b>Nagai Kaf\u016b's</b> writings center mostly around the entertainment districts of Tokyo with their geisha and prostitutes. Here, his stories <em>The bill-collecting</em> and <em>Ukiyo-e</em> are presented.<br><br> \n\n<b>Shimazaki T\u014dson</b> was one of the representatives of Japanese naturalism, which we can see in his stories <em>A Domestic Animal</em> and <em>Tsugaru Strait</em>. <br><br>\n\n<b>Taketomo Torao</b>, the editor and translator of this volume, translated many Western works into Japanese, for example the Rubayat, the Divine Comedy, and works by Shakespeare. He was also a writer in his own right. <br><br> ", "duration": 8753, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "3099", "name": "\u014cgai Mori"}, {"id": "10205", "name": "Kaf\u016b Nagai"}, {"id": "3545", "name": "T\u014dson Shimazaki"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt17/paulownia_1410.jpg", "copyright_year": "1918", "genres": ["Short Stories"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Availle"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Availle"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Availle"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Annise"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Foreword and Introduction", "readers": [4174], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/paulownia_1410_librivox/paulownia_0_taketomo_64kb.mp3", "duration": 803}, {"section": 1, "title": "Takase bune by Mori \u014cgai", "readers": [4174], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/paulownia_1410_librivox/paulownia_1_taketomo_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1580}, {"section": 2, "title": "Hanako by Mori \u014cgai", "readers": [4174], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/paulownia_1410_librivox/paulownia_2_taketomo_64kb.mp3", "duration": 894}, {"section": 3, "title": "The pier by Mori \u014cgai", "readers": [4174], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/paulownia_1410_librivox/paulownia_3_taketomo_64kb.mp3", "duration": 736}, {"section": 4, "title": "The bill-collecting by Nagai Kaf\u016b", "readers": [4174], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/paulownia_1410_librivox/paulownia_4_taketomo_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1643}, {"section": 5, "title": "Ukiyoe by Nagai Kaf\u016b", "readers": [4174], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/paulownia_1410_librivox/paulownia_5_taketomo_64kb.mp3", "duration": 568}, {"section": 6, "title": "A domestic animal by Shimazaki T\u014dson", "readers": [4174], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/paulownia_1410_librivox/paulownia_6_taketomo_64kb.mp3", "duration": 858}, {"section": 7, "title": "Tsugaru Strait by Shimazaki T\u014dson", "readers": [4174], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/paulownia_1410_librivox/paulownia_7_taketomo_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1671}]}
