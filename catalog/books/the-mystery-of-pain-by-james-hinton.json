{"title": "Mystery of Pain", "description": "This book is addressed to the sorrowful, ... to whom their own or others' pain is a daily burden, upon whose hearts it weighs with an intolerable anguish. I seek to speak to these ; not as a teacher, but as a fellow. Sharing their feeling, and knowing well how vain is the attempt to throw off misery, or to persuade ourselves that life is better than it is, I would fain share with them also some thoughts that have seemed to me capable of casting a bright gleam of light athwart the darkness, and, if they are true, of bringing an immense, an incredible joy out of the very bosom of distress. - Summary by James Hinton", "duration": 7343, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "12143", "name": "James Hinton"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/mystery_of_pain_1609_librivox/themysteryofpain_1609.jpg", "copyright_year": "1892", "genres": ["Health & Fitness", "Self-Help", "Christianity - Other"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Ethan D.
