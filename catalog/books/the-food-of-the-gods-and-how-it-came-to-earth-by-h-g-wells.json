{"title": "Food of the Gods and How it Came to Earth", "description": "Two stuffy English scientists, always looking to further their scientific knowledge, create a substance called Herakleophorbia, which in its fourth incarnation \u2013 known as Herakleophorbia IV \u2013 has the special ability of making things increase greatly in size. As the scientists begin experimentation on some chicks, the substance is misused by some \u201ccountry folk\u201d who don\u2019t take it seriously and soon Herakleophorbia IV is running rampant throughout England and then across the globe, creating giant plants and animals that wreak havoc on the land and then the people. Then the first giant babies are revealed and for the first time humanity has to contend with the existence of a new race of giant people. How humanity deals with this shocking new creation is revealed in The Food of the Gods and How it Came to Earth. (Summary by Alex C. Telander)", "duration": 22599, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "146", "name": "H. G.
