The story begins with Deianeira, the wife of Heracles, relating the story of her early life and her plight adjusting to married life.  She is now distraught over her husband's neglect of her family.  Often involved in some adventure, he rarely visits them.  She sends their son Hyllus to find him, as she is concerned over prophecies about Heracles and the land he is currently in.  After Hyllus sets off, a messenger arrives with word that Heracles, victorious in his recent battle, is making offerings on Cape Cenaeum and coming home soon to Trachis.  But Heracles' arrival with a beautiful young slave girl complicates the marital situation more than ever, leading to desperate measures on the part of Deianeira and a tragic denouement. - Summary by Wikipedia (edited by Expatriate)", "duration": 4275, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "1157", "name": " Sophocles"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/trachiniai_campbell_translation_1512_librivox/trachiniai_1512.jpg", "copyright_year": "1896", "genres": ["Classics (Greek & Latin Antiquity)", "Tragedy"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Expatriate"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Expatriate"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "DaveC"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Part I", "readers": [8713], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/trachiniai_campbell_translation_1512_librivox/trachiniai_01_sophocles_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2191}, {"section": 2, "title": "Part II", "readers": [8713], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/trachiniai_campbell_translation_1512_librivox/trachiniai_02_sophocles_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2084}]}
