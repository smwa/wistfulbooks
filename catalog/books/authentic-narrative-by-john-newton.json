{"title": "Authentic Narrative of Some Remarkable and Interesting Particulars in the Life of John Newton", "description": "John Newton, best known for his hymn \"Amazing Grace\", for his former life as a slave trader and as eventual opponent of the slave trade in Britain. These 14 short letters cover his early life to about 1755 and are filled with his Christian reflections on the events of his life. Letter 5 contains Newton's description of his life under Amos Clowe, an enslaver, who gave him to his wife as a servant. It is worth noting that this collection was published in 1764 and Newton did not publish his scathing pamphlet Thoughts Upon the Slave Trade until 1788 and thus his letters focus on his life as a \"an infidel and libertine\" (Newton's own description) than on the institution he later condemned. - Summary by InTheDesert", "duration": 12614, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "8571", "name": "John Newton"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/authenticnarrative_johnnewton_2109_librivox/authenticnarrativejohnnewton_2109.jpg", "copyright_year": "1810", "genres": ["Letters", "Christianity - Biographies"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "InTheDesert"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "TriciaG"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Larry Wilson"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Preface", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/authenticnarrative_johnnewton_2109_librivox/authenticnarrative_00_newton_64kb.mp3", "duration": 114}, {"section": 1, "title": "Introductory Observations", "readers": [8425], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/authenticnarrative_johnnewton_2109_librivox/authenticnarrative_01_newton_64kb.mp3", "duration": 820}, {"section": 2, "title": "Occurrences in Early Life", "readers": [8425], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/authenticnarrative_johnnewton_2109_librivox/authenticnarrative_02_newton_64kb.mp3", "duration": 800}, {"section": 3, "title": "Journey to Kent, Voyage to Venice", "readers": [15639], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/authenticnarrative_johnnewton_2109_librivox/authenticnarrative_03_newton_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1593}, {"section": 4, "title": "Voyage to Madeira, Entry on board a Guineaman, and Voyage to Africa", "readers": [15639], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/authenticnarrative_johnnewton_2109_librivox/authenticnarrative_04_newton_64kb.mp3", "duration": 876}, {"section": 5, "title": "Hardships endured in Africa", "readers": [15639], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/authenticnarrative_johnnewton_2109_librivox/authenticnarrative_05_newton_64kb.mp3", "duration": 925}, {"section": 6, "title": "Enlargement in Africa", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/authenticnarrative_johnnewton_2109_librivox/authenticnarrative_06_newton_64kb.mp3", "duration": 726}, {"section": 7, "title": "Voyage from Cape Lopez for England", "readers": [15639], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/authenticnarrative_johnnewton_2109_librivox/authenticnarrative_07_newton_64kb.mp3", "duration": 840}, {"section": 8, "title": "Danger in the Voyage from Cape Lopez", "readers": [15639], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/authenticnarrative_johnnewton_2109_librivox/authenticnarrative_08_newton_64kb.mp3", "duration": 901}, {"section": 9, "title": "Events in Ireland, and arrival in England", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/authenticnarrative_johnnewton_2109_librivox/authenticnarrative_09_newton_64kb.mp3", "duration": 714}, {"section": 10, "title": "Voyage to Africa", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/authenticnarrative_johnnewton_2109_librivox/authenticnarrative_10_newton_64kb.mp3", "duration": 722}, {"section": 11, "title": "Voyage to Antigua, return to England, and Marriage", "readers": [12963], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/authenticnarrative_johnnewton_2109_librivox/authenticnarrative_11_newton_64kb.mp3", "duration": 867}, {"section": 12, "title": "Another Voyage to Africa", "readers": [13587], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/authenticnarrative_johnnewton_2109_librivox/authenticnarrative_12_newton_64kb.mp3", "duration": 846}, {"section": 13, "title": "Last Voyage to Africa", "readers": [16364], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/authenticnarrative_johnnewton_2109_librivox/authenticnarrative_13_newton_64kb.mp3", "duration": 945}, {"section": 14, "title": "Conclusion of the Narrative", "readers": [12963], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/authenticnarrative_johnnewton_2109_librivox/authenticnarrative_14_newton_64kb.mp3", "duration": 925}]}
