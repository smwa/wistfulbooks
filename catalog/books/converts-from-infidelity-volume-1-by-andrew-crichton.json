{"title": "Converts from Infidelity, Volume 1", "description": "Converts from infidelity; or, Lives of eminent individuals who have renounced libertine principles and sceptical opinions, and embraced Christianity.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\u2026Some of the more generally known, and best accredited examples of these conversions, the reader of the following volumes will find, in the Lives of Eminent Individuals who have renounced libertine principles and sceptical opinions, and embraced Christianity. Such narratives may be regarded as interesting in themselves, but more especially important, as furnishing the most authentic testimonies to the truths of revealed religion; and setting forth the decided concessions in their favour, which have been extorted under circumstances so impressive, and from witnesses whose competency or credibility cannot be doubted. \r\n<br><br>\r\nAmong the Converts here selected are to be found men of all ranks and professions in life, laymen and clergymen, statesmen, philosophers, historians, poets, and physicians; many of whom were not less distinguished for their extensive acquirements in learning and science, than for the homage they paid to religion. They exhibit instances of various attainments in knowledge, and of all descriptions of intellectual vigour,\u2014 of men who cannot be charged with acting from hypocrisy, or under the influence of prejudice, \u2014 who have been deeply versed in the philosophy of nature, and accustomed to the most cautious forms of scientific experiment, \u2014 and who, had the evidences of Revelation been weak, or founded on error, were in every respect qualified, and from the character of their previous habits and opinions, would have been most eager to detect and expose the imposture.", "duration": 30069, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "17109", "name": "Andrew Crichton"}], "coverArt": null, "copyright_year": "1827", "genres": ["Biography & Autobiography", "Christianity - Biographies"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "InTheDesert"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "TriciaG"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "stepheather"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Preface", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/convertsfrominfidelity1_2308_librivox/convertsinfidelityv1_00_crichton_64kb.mp3", "duration": 663}, {"section": 1, "title": "John Wilmot, Earl of Rochester - Part 1", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/convertsfrominfidelity1_2308_librivox/convertsinfidelityv1_01_crichton_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2323}, {"section": 2, "title": "John Wilmot, Earl of Rochester - Part 2", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/convertsfrominfidelity1_2308_librivox/convertsinfidelityv1_02_crichton_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1690}, {"section": 3, "title": "John Wilmot, Earl of Rochester - Part 3", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/convertsfrominfidelity1_2308_librivox/convertsinfidelityv1_03_crichton_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2049}, {"section": 4, "title": "John Wilmot, Earl of Rochester - Part 4", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/convertsfrominfidelity1_2308_librivox/convertsinfidelityv1_04_crichton_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1846}, {"section": 5, "title": "Count Struensee - Part 1", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/convertsfrominfidelity1_2308_librivox/convertsinfidelityv1_05_crichton_64kb.mp3", "duration": 867}, {"section": 6, "title": "Count Struensee - Part 2", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/convertsfrominfidelity1_2308_librivox/convertsinfidelityv1_06_crichton_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1035}, {"section": 7, "title": "Count Struensee - Part 3", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/convertsfrominfidelity1_2308_librivox/convertsinfidelityv1_07_crichton_64kb.mp3", "duration": 794}, {"section": 8, "title": "Count Struensee - Part 4", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/convertsfrominfidelity1_2308_librivox/convertsinfidelityv1_08_crichton_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2399}, {"section": 9, "title": "Count Struensee - Part 5", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/convertsfrominfidelity1_2308_librivox/convertsinfidelityv1_09_crichton_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3218}, {"section": 10, "title": "Count Brandt", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/convertsfrominfidelity1_2308_librivox/convertsinfidelityv1_10_crichton_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1431}, {"section": 11, "title": "Lord Lyttelton - Part 1", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/convertsfrominfidelity1_2308_librivox/convertsinfidelityv1_11_crichton_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1340}, {"section": 12, "title": "Lord Lyttelton - Part 2", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/convertsfrominfidelity1_2308_librivox/convertsinfidelityv1_12_crichton_64kb.mp3", "duration": 619}, {"section": 13, "title": "Lord Lyttelton - Part 3", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/convertsfrominfidelity1_2308_librivox/convertsinfidelityv1_13_crichton_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2476}, {"section": 14, "title": "Sir John Pringle", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/convertsfrominfidelity1_2308_librivox/convertsinfidelityv1_14_crichton_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2185}, {"section": 15, "title": "Gilbert West", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/convertsfrominfidelity1_2308_librivox/convertsinfidelityv1_15_crichton_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1968}, {"section": 16, "title": "Charles Gildon", "readers": [17550], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/convertsfrominfidelity1_2308_librivox/convertsinfidelityv1_16_crichton_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1109}, {"section": 17, "title": "Rev.
