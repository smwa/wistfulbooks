{"title": "Agamemnon", "description": "Agamemnon is a verse tragedy of 1012 lines written by the Roman playwright Seneca the Younger in the 1st Century CE and based on the Greek Legend of the conflict within the House of Atreus.\r\n<BR><BR>\r\nThe blood-feud between Atreus and Thyestes was not ended with the terrible vengeance which Atreus wreaked upon his brother. It was yet in fate that Thyestes should live to beget upon his own daughter a son, Aegisthus, who should slay Atreus and bring ruin and death upon the great Atrides, Agamemnon.\r\n<BR><BR>\r\nThe Trojan war is done. And now the near approach of the victorious king, bringing his captives and treasure home to Argos, has been announced. But little does he dream to what a home he is returning. For Clytemnestra, enraged at Agamemnon because he had sacrificed her daughter Iphigenia at Aulis to appease the winds, and full of jealousy because he brings Cassandra as her rival home, estranged also by the long-continued absence of her lord, but most estranged by her own guilty union with Aegisthus, is now plotting to slay Agamemnon on his return, gaining thus at once revenge and safety from his wrath.\r\n<BR><BR>\r\n(Summary by Alan Mapstone and the translator)\r\n<BR><BR>Cast List\r\n<BR><BR>\r\nAgamemnon, King of Argos: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/7170\">Alan Mapstone</a><br>\r\nGhost of Thyestes: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/7170\">Alan Mapstone</a><br>\r\nClytemnesta: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/15373\">Wendy Katz Hiller</a><br>\r\nAegisthus: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/17576\">Beeswaxcandle</a><br>\r\nCassandra: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/13140\">Jenn Broda</a><br>\r\nEurybates: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/8011\">Greg Giordano</a><br>\r\nElectra: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/10179\">Sonia</a><br>\r\nStrobius: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/6754\">ToddHW</a><br>\r\nNurse: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/6924\">Rapunzelina</a><br>\r\nChorus of Argive Women: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/13075\">Rita Boutros</a><br>\r\nBand of Captive Trojan Women: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/18543\">Agnes Robert Behr</a><br>\r\nStage Directions: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/17662\">Inkell</a><br>", "duration": 4913, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "257", "name": "Lucius Annaeus Seneca"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/agamemnon_2309_librivox/agamemnon_2309.jpg", "copyright_year": "1907", "genres": ["Tragedy"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Alan Mapstone"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "ToddHW"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Alan Mapstone"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Introduction and Dramatis Personae", "readers": [7170], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/agamemnon_2309_librivox/agamemnon_0_seneca_64kb.mp3", "duration": 248}, {"section": 1, "title": "Act 1", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/agamemnon_2309_librivox/agamemnon_1_seneca_64kb.mp3", "duration": 530}, {"section": 2, "title": "Act 2", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/agamemnon_2309_librivox/agamemnon_2_seneca_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1238}, {"section": 3, "title": "Act 3", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/agamemnon_2309_librivox/agamemnon_3_seneca_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1711}, {"section": 4, "title": "Act 4", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/agamemnon_2309_librivox/agamemnon_4_seneca_64kb.mp3", "duration": 415}, {"section": 5, "title": "Act 5", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/agamemnon_2309_librivox/agamemnon_5_seneca_64kb.mp3", "duration": 771}]}
