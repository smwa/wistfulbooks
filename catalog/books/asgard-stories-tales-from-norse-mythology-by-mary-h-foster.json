{"title": "Asgard Stories: Tales from Norse Mythology", "description": "Asgard Stories - Tales from Norse Mythology. To all our Children who have loved the hearing of these Asgard Stories. This little volume is the outcome of several years experience in telling to classes of children the classic myths, both southern and northern. <br><br>\r\n\r\n\"A broad simplicity, so very different from the light gracefulness of the old Greek paganism, distinguishes this Norse system. It is thought, the genuine thought of deep, rude, earnest minds, fairly opened to the things about them, - a face-to-face and heart-to-heart inspection of things, - the first characteristic of all good thought in all times.\" wrote Carlyle. <br><br>\r\n\r\nAnderson, the author of \u201cNorse Mythology,\u201d wrote: \u201cIn the Norse mythology the centralizing idea is its peculiar feature; in it lies its strength and beauty. The one myth and the one divinity is inextricably in communion with the other; and thus also the idea of unity, centralization, is a prominent feature and one of the chief characteristics of the Teutonic nations.\"", "duration": 9247, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "16341", "name": "Mabel H.
