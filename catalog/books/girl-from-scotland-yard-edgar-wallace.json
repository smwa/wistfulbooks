{"title": "Girl From Scotland Yard", "description": "This is another of the fine detective mysteries written by Edgar Wallace during the early part of the twentieth century. This particular story revolves around the adventures of one Leslie Maughn who is employed as an advisor to New Scotland Yard in the days before women could become actual police officers. Supervised by her boss, Inspector Coldwell, she unravels a complex plot created by the Druze family. The other main character in the story is Peter Dawlish, a recently released prisoner from Dartmoor Prison who naturally becomes the first person suspected in a recently discovered murder. Added to this is the sub plot of a compelling young girl who is mistreated by her mother, confusion over a missing piece of jewelry, and as always, the burgeoning romance common to Edgar Wallace novels. - Summary by Howard Skyman", "duration": 22187, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "2079", "name": "Edgar Wallace"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/girlfromscotlandyard_2601_librivox/girl_scotland_yard_2601.jpg", "copyright_year": "1928", "genres": ["Detective Fiction"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Howard Skyman"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Howard Skyman"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "DaveC"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Laura Victoria"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "I.
