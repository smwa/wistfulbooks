{"title": "Defence of Catholic Principles in a Letter to a Protestant Clergyman", "description": "Demetrius A. Gallitzin (1770-1840) was born a Russian Prince, but converted from a nominal Orthodoxy to the Catholic church, in which he was ordained a priest. Emigrating to America, he became the \"Apostle of the Alleghenies\" where he spent much of his fortune to spread Catholicism. Aroused by a sermon which he felt misrepresented 'popery,' he wrote a series of letters to the Huntington Gazette, which were published under the title, Defence of Catholic Principles (1816). An enlarged version of this brochure went through repeated editions in the United States and Ireland and was translated for use in Europe. - Summary by Austin Smay", "duration": 17653, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "18635", "name": "Demetrius Gallitzin"}], "coverArt": null, "copyright_year": "1880", "genres": ["Christianity - Other"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "rroderick"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "rroderick"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "TriciaG"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "stepheather"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Preface", "readers": [19799], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/defenceofcatholicprinciples_2507_librivox/defencecatholicprinciples_00_gallitzin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 189}, {"section": 1, "title": "A Defense, etc.", "readers": [19799], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/defenceofcatholicprinciples_2507_librivox/defencecatholicprinciples_01_gallitzin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 521}, {"section": 2, "title": "Article I - A Summary of the Catholic Doctrine", "readers": [19799], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/defenceofcatholicprinciples_2507_librivox/defencecatholicprinciples_02_gallitzin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3193}, {"section": 3, "title": "Article II - Confession", "readers": [19799], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/defenceofcatholicprinciples_2507_librivox/defencecatholicprinciples_03_gallitzin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 976}, {"section": 4, "title": "Article III - The Eucharist or Lord's Supper", "readers": [19799], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/defenceofcatholicprinciples_2507_librivox/defencecatholicprinciples_04_gallitzin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2647}, {"section": 5, "title": "Article IV - The Sacrifice of the Mass", "readers": [19799], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/defenceofcatholicprinciples_2507_librivox/defencecatholicprinciples_05_gallitzin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 715}, {"section": 6, "title": "Article V - Communion under one Kind or Form", "readers": [19799], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/defenceofcatholicprinciples_2507_librivox/defencecatholicprinciples_06_gallitzin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 497}, {"section": 7, "title": "Article VI - Purgatory and Prayers for the Dead", "readers": [19799], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/defenceofcatholicprinciples_2507_librivox/defencecatholicprinciples_07_gallitzin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1333}, {"section": 8, "title": "Article VII - Honouring the Saints, and applying to their Intercession", "readers": [19799], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/defenceofcatholicprinciples_2507_librivox/defencecatholicprinciples_08_gallitzin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1454}, {"section": 9, "title": "Article VIII - Images, Pictures and Relics", "readers": [19799], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/defenceofcatholicprinciples_2507_librivox/defencecatholicprinciples_09_gallitzin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 968}, {"section": 10, "title": "Article IX - The Pope", "readers": [19799], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/defenceofcatholicprinciples_2507_librivox/defencecatholicprinciples_10_gallitzin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1591}, {"section": 11, "title": "Article X - Toleration", "readers": [19799], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/defenceofcatholicprinciples_2507_librivox/defencecatholicprinciples_11_gallitzin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1041}, {"section": 12, "title": "Conclusion", "readers": [19799], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/defenceofcatholicprinciples_2507_librivox/defencecatholicprinciples_12_gallitzin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1352}, {"section": 13, "title": "An Appeal to the Protestant Public", "readers": [19799], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/defenceofcatholicprinciples_2507_librivox/defencecatholicprinciples_13_gallitzin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1176}]}
