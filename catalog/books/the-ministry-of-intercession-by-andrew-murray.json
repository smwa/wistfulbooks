{"title": "Ministry of Intercession", "description": "Andrew Murray sub-titled this book \"A Plea for More Prayer\". In it, he shows how throughout Scripture, in the life of every saint, and that of God\u2019s own Son, and all through Church history, God is, first of all, a prayer-hearing God. He builds upon the truths brought out in his earlier volume \u201cWith Christ in the School of Prayer\u201d, by showing firstly that Christ meant prayer to be the great power by which His Church should do its work, and secondly that we have far too little conception of the place that intercession, as opposed to praying just for our own needs, should have in the Church and in the Christian life. The book concludes with some very helpful practical guidelines on intercession. - Summary by Christopher Smith", "duration": 21692, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "2839", "name": "Andrew Murray"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt33/Ministry_Intercession_1402.jpg", "copyright_year": "1898", "genres": ["Christianity - Other"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Christopher Smith"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Christopher Smith"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Bev J Stevens"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "fiddlesticks"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Introduction", "readers": [7424], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ministryofintercession_1401_librivox/ministryofintercession_00_murray_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1193}, {"section": 1, "title": "The Lack of Prayer", "readers": [7424], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ministryofintercession_1401_librivox/ministryofintercession_01_murray_64kb.mp3", "duration": 905}, {"section": 2, "title": "The Ministration of the Spirit and Prayer", "readers": [7424], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ministryofintercession_1401_librivox/ministryofintercession_02_murray_64kb.mp3", "duration": 898}, {"section": 3, "title": "A Model of Intercession", "readers": [7424], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ministryofintercession_1401_librivox/ministryofintercession_03_murray_64kb.mp3", "duration": 979}, {"section": 4, "title": "Because of his Importunity", "readers": [7424], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ministryofintercession_1401_librivox/ministryofintercession_04_murray_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1035}, {"section": 5, "title": "The Life that can Pray", "readers": [7424], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ministryofintercession_1401_librivox/ministryofintercession_05_murray_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1023}, {"section": 6, "title": "Restraining Prayer - Is It Sin?", "readers": [7424], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ministryofintercession_1401_librivox/ministryofintercession_06_murray_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1132}, {"section": 7, "title": "Who Shall Deliver?", "readers": [7424], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ministryofintercession_1401_librivox/ministryofintercession_07_murray_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1244}, {"section": 8, "title": "Wilt Thou Be Made Whole?", "readers": [7424], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ministryofintercession_1401_librivox/ministryofintercession_08_murray_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1067}, {"section": 9, "title": "The Secret of Effectual Prayer", "readers": [7424], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ministryofintercession_1401_librivox/ministryofintercession_09_murray_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1075}, {"section": 10, "title": "The Spirit of Supplication", "readers": [7424], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ministryofintercession_1401_librivox/ministryofintercession_10_murray_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1271}, {"section": 11, "title": "In the Name of Christ", "readers": [7424], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ministryofintercession_1401_librivox/ministryofintercession_11_murray_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1422}, {"section": 12, "title": "My God Will Hear Me", "readers": [7424], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ministryofintercession_1401_librivox/ministryofintercession_12_murray_64kb.mp3", "duration": 985}, {"section": 13, "title": "Paul a Pattern of Prayer", "readers": [7424], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ministryofintercession_1401_librivox/ministryofintercession_13_murray_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1148}, {"section": 14, "title": "God Seeks Intercessors", "readers": [7424], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ministryofintercession_1401_librivox/ministryofintercession_14_murray_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1019}, {"section": 15, "title": "The Coming Revival", "readers": [7424], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ministryofintercession_1401_librivox/ministryofintercession_15_murray_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1034}, {"section": 16, "title": "Appendix Pt 1 - Pray Without Ceasing: Helps to Intercession", "readers": [7424], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ministryofintercession_1401_librivox/ministryofintercession_16_murray_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2110}, {"section": 17, "title": "Appendix Pt 2 - Pray Without Ceasing: Helps to Intercession", "readers": [7424], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ministryofintercession_1401_librivox/ministryofintercession_17_murray_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2152}]}
