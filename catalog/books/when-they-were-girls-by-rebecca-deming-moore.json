{"title": "When They Were Girls", "description": "Jane Addams, Susan B. Anthony, Clara Barton, Frances Burnett, Julia Howe, Hellen Keller,  and Harriet Beecher Stowe are some of the influencial women in our history whose lives and accomplishments are covered in this little book.  \"When They Were Girls contains the stories of a group of American women, each one of whom occupies a very important place in her particular field. The stories of these women have been written many times before. We feel, however, that in this book you possibly may find that their stories have been written in a little different way. Our desire has been to bring very closely to the attention of our many readers some of the outstanding characteristics in the girlhoods of these women, and to show the relationship between these qualities in girlhood and the achievements of adult life.\"  - Summary by author", "duration": 10615, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "14811", "name": "Rebecca Deming Moore"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/whentheyweregirls_2005_librivox/whentheyweregirls_2005.jpg", "copyright_year": "1923", "genres": ["Biography"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Helen Z.
