This 31st issue of the serial was published on June 1st, 1880.

The story \"Across the Ocean\" concludes as young Frank Austin's journey reaches its end in China and he considers his choices of next adventure. Other highlights of this issue include an ambitious plan to put a brook to work, an account of early industrial espionage in the steel industry, the rags to riches story of a young singer whose talent captures the attention of a benefactor, and a new serial story of a group of boys preparing to set out on a sailing journey.
