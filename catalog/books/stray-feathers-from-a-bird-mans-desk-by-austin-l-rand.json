{"title": "Stray Feathers From a Bird Man's Desk", "description": "Canadian zoologist, Austin L. Rand, takes a divergence from his scholarly works on ornithology to give us 60 entertaining sketches of bird life and lore from Birds Bathing to Courtship Feeding.  <br><br>\r\n\r\nFrom the author's introduction: \"In looking back over the preparation of these sketches I feel as though each evening I'd gathered up the bits and pieces left over from the day's work and fashioned them into designs for my own amusement and the edification of my family. Truly it's as though I'd used stray feathers, fallen from the bird skins I'd handled, and fitted them together into something of wider interest than the original.. . . . This series of articles is intended to be interesting and entertaining.\" - Summary by Larry Wilson", "duration": 18960, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "16406", "name": "Austin L.
