{"title": "Andromache", "description": "Andromache is a Classical Greek verse tragedy written by Euripides in the 5th century BCE.\r\n\r\nWhen Troy was taken by the Greeks, Andromache, wife of that Hector whom Achilles slew ere himself was slain by the arrow which Apollo guided, was given in the dividing of the spoils to Neoptolemus, Achilles\u2019 son. So he took her oversea to the land of Thessaly, and loved her, and entreated her kindly, and she bare him a son in her captivity. But after ten years! Neoptolemus took to wife a princess of Sparta, Hermione, daughter of Menelaus and Helen. But to these was no child born, and the soul of Hermione grew bitter with jealousy against Andromache. Now Neoptolemus, in his indignation for his father\u2019s death, had upbraided Apollo therewith: wherefore he now journeyed to Delphi, vainly hoping by prayer and sacrifice to assuage the wrath of the God. But so soon as he was gone, Hermione sought to avenge herself on Andromache ; and Menelaus came thither also, and these twain went about to slay the captive and her child, Wherefore Andromache hid her son, and took sanctuary at the altar of the Goddess Thetis, expecting till Peleus, her lord\u2019s grandsire, should come to save her. And herein are set forth her sore peril and deliverance : also it is told how Neoptolemus found death at Delphi, and how he that contrived his death took his wife.\r\n\r\n(Summary by Alan Mapstone and the Translator)\r\n<br><br>\r\n<b>Cast List</b><br>\r\nAndromache: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/15373\">Wendy Katz Hiller</a><br>\r\nHandmaid: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/18543\">Agnes Robert Behr</a><br>\r\nHermione: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/13075\">Rita Boutros</a><br>\r\nMenelaus: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/4705\">Algy Pug</a><br>\r\nMolossus: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/17662\">Inkell</a><br>\r\nPeleus: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/17576\">Beeswaxcandle</a><br>\r\nNurse: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/10179\">Sonia</a><br>\r\nOrestes: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/8011\">Greg Giordano</a><br>\r\nMessenger: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/8425\">Larry Wilson</a><br>\r\nThetis: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/16764\">dc</a><br>\r\nChorus: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/7170\">Alan Mapstone</a><br>\r\nStage Directions: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/16205\">James R Hedrick</a><br>", "duration": 5688, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "1247", "name": " Euripides"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/andromache_2310_librivox/andromache_2310.jpg", "copyright_year": "1912", "genres": ["Tragedy"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Alan Mapstone"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "redrun"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "redrun"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Argument and Dramatis Personae", "readers": [7170], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/andromache_2310_librivox/andromache_0_euripides_64kb.mp3", "duration": 258}, {"section": 1, "title": "Part 1: Andromache and Hermione", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/andromache_2310_librivox/andromache_1_euripides_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1384}, {"section": 2, "title": "Part 2: Menelaus", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/andromache_2310_librivox/andromache_2_euripides_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1041}, {"section": 3, "title": "Part 3: Peleus", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/andromache_2310_librivox/andromache_3_euripides_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1303}, {"section": 4, "title": "Part 4: Orestes", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/andromache_2310_librivox/andromache_4_euripides_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1702}]}
