M. Smallheer  \n<br><br>\nFrom the Preface of Vol 1 No 1:<br>\n\"Of all animated nature, birds are the most beautiful in coloring, most graceful in form and action, swiftest in motion and most perfect emblems of freedom.\n<br><br>\nThey are withal, very intelligent and have many remarkable traits, so that their habits and characteristics make a delightful study for all lovers of nature. In view of the facts, we feel that we are doing a useful work for the young, and one that will be appreciated by progressive parents, in placing within the easy possession of children in the homes these beautiful photographs of birds.\n<br><br>\nThe text is prepared with the view of giving the children as clear an idea as possible, of haunts, habits, characteristics and such other information as will lead them to love the birds and delight in their study and acquaintance.\" NATURE STUDY PUBLISHING CO.", "duration": 3540, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "18", "name": " Various"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/birdsjan1897_2005_librivox/birds_jan1897.jpg", "copyright_year": "1897", "genres": ["Nature"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "J.
