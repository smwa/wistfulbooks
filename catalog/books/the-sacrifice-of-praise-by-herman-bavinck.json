{"title": "Sacrifice of Praise", "description": "This book is of an intensely practical nature.  The subject, as the headings of the twelve chapters indicate, is \"Confession.\"  We do not hesitate to say that in practical church life there is still considerable misunderstanding as to confessing Christ.  Throughout the book the fundamental significance of the Covenant of Grace with its attendant promises, conditions, and blessings is clearly set forth.  In a word, \"The Sacrifice of Praise\" is a masterpiece on the subject of confessing Christ, both for instruction and comfort to those who intend to unite with the Church and to its members in full communion.\r\n\r\nIt is our humble and happy task to commend \"The Sacrifice of Praise\" to our churches, especially to the Reformed Church in America.  We can do this most cheerfully because it is our personal conviction that Dr. H. Bavinck was, by the grace of God, the Prince of recent Reformed theologians.
