{"title": "Christmas Carol (Version 09)", "description": "\"A Christmas Carol\" has been credited with relaunching the celebration of Christmas as we know it. It relaunched Charles Dickens' literary career, that is for sure!  More than that, and more importantly, it is an illustration of one \"covetous old sinner\" and his opportunity for redemption in the eyes of both God and man.  For me the book holds a special meaning for it repeatedly shows me that no matter how I often I may make mistakes, mercy and forgiveness are there for the asking.  - Summary by Greg Giordano", "duration": 12311, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "91", "name": "Charles Dickens"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/christmas_carol_gg_1611_librivox/christmascarolversion9_1611.jpg", "copyright_year": "1905", "genres": ["Culture & Heritage Fiction"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Greg Giordano"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Greg Giordano"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Ann Boulais"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Ann Boulais"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Preface", "readers": [8011], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/christmas_carol_gg_1611_librivox/christmascarolv9_00_dickens_64kb.mp3", "duration": 86}, {"section": 1, "title": "Stave One -  Marley's Ghost", "readers": [8011], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/christmas_carol_gg_1611_librivox/christmascarolv9_01_dickens_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2855}, {"section": 2, "title": "Stave Two - The First of the Three Spirits", "readers": [8011], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/christmas_carol_gg_1611_librivox/christmascarolv9_02_dickens_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2687}, {"section": 3, "title": "Stave Three - The Second of the Three Spirits", "readers": [8011], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/christmas_carol_gg_1611_librivox/christmascarolv9_03_dickens_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3403}, {"section": 4, "title": "Stave Four - The Last of the Spirits", "readers": [8011], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/christmas_carol_gg_1611_librivox/christmascarolv9_04_dickens_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2262}, {"section": 5, "title": "Stave Five - The End of it", "readers": [8011], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/christmas_carol_gg_1611_librivox/christmascarolv9_05_dickens_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1018}]}
