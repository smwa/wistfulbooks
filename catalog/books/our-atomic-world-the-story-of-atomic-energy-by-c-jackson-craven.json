{"title": "Our Atomic World: The Story of Atomic Energy", "description": "This booklet is part of the \"Understanding the Atom Series\" published by the Division of Technical Information of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. From an introduction of atomic theory by the ancient Greeks through the development of the fission bomb, the author covers such areas as the discovery of the nucleus, the discovery of isotopes, fission and fusion including a chronology of atomic theory to 1963, and the development of the Atomic Energy Commission.
