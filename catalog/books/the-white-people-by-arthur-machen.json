{"title": "White People", "description": "Literary critics see Arthur Machen\u2019s works as a significant part of the late Victorian revival of the gothic novel and the decadent movement of the 1890s, bearing direct comparison to the themes found in contemporary works like Robert Louis Stevenson\u2019s The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, Bram Stoker\u2019s Dracula, and Oscar Wilde\u2019s The Picture of Dorian Gray. The White People is a highly influential horror story of a young girl\u2019s discovery of ancient magic. It was written in the late 1890s as part of a longer unfinished novel, some sketches from which went into his book Ornaments in Jade. Fans of supernatural fiction often cite this story as a classic in the genre.
