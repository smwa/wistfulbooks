{"title": "Castles in the Air", "description": "Baroness Emma Orczy (full name: Emma (\"Emmuska\") Magdolna Roz\u00e1lia M\u00e1ria Jozefa Borb\u00e1la Orczy de Orczi) (September 23, 1865 \u2013 November 12, 1947) was a British novelist, playwright and artist of Hungarian noble origin. She was most notable for her series of novels featuring the Scarlet Pimpernel. <br /><br /><em>Castles in the Air</em>, a short novel or perhaps more like a collection of short stories with memories of a French rogue in the early 19th century Paris, was published in 1921 and about it I quote from the foreword: \"In very truth my good friend Ratichon is an unblushing liar, thief, a forger--anything you will; his vanity is past belief, his scruples are non-existent. How he escaped a convict settlement it is difficult to imagine, and hard to realize that he died--presumably some years after the event recorded in the last chapter of his autobiography--a respected member of the community, honoured by that same society which should have raised a punitive hand against him.\" (Summary by Wikipedia, Lars Rolander and Emma Orczy)", "duration": 27863, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "1256", "name": "Baroness Emma Orczy"}], "coverArt": "http://www.archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt16/Castles_Air_1205.jpg", "copyright_year": "1921", "genres": ["General Fiction", "Short Stories"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Lars Rolander (1942-2016)"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Lars Rolander (1942-2016)"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Ruth Golding"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Leni"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Foreword", "readers": [2234], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/castles_in_the_air_lr_librivox/castlesinair_00_orczy_64kb.mp3", "duration": 335}, {"section": 1, "title": "Chapter I - A Roland for his Oliver Pt 1", "readers": [2234], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/castles_in_the_air_lr_librivox/castlesinair_01_orczy_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1670}, {"section": 2, "title": "Chapter I - A Roland for his Oliver Pt 2", "readers": [2234], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/castles_in_the_air_lr_librivox/castlesinair_02_orczy_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2160}, {"section": 3, "title": "Chapter II - A Fool's Paradise Pt 1", "readers": [2234], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/castles_in_the_air_lr_librivox/castlesinair_03_orczy_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1583}, {"section": 4, "title": "Chapter II - A Fool's Paradise Pt 2", "readers": [2234], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/castles_in_the_air_lr_librivox/castlesinair_04_orczy_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1350}, {"section": 5, "title": "Chapter III - On the Brink Pt 1", "readers": [2234], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/castles_in_the_air_lr_librivox/castlesinair_05_orczy_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1965}, {"section": 6, "title": "Chapter III - On the Brink Pt 2", "readers": [2234], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/castles_in_the_air_lr_librivox/castlesinair_06_orczy_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2713}, {"section": 7, "title": "Chapter IV - Carissimo Pt 1", "readers": [2234], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/castles_in_the_air_lr_librivox/castlesinair_07_orczy_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1683}, {"section": 8, "title": "Chapter IV - Carissimo Pt 2", "readers": [2234], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/castles_in_the_air_lr_librivox/castlesinair_08_orczy_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1640}, {"section": 9, "title": "Chapter IV - Carissimo Pt 3", "readers": [2234], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/castles_in_the_air_lr_librivox/castlesinair_09_orczy_64kb.mp3", "duration": 950}, {"section": 10, "title": "Chapter V - The Toys Pt 1", "readers": [2234], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/castles_in_the_air_lr_librivox/castlesinair_10_orczy_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2070}, {"section": 11, "title": "Chapter V - The Toys Pt 2", "readers": [2234], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/castles_in_the_air_lr_librivox/castlesinair_11_orczy_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2633}, {"section": 12, "title": "Chapter VI - Honour among ----- Pt 1", "readers": [2234], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/castles_in_the_air_lr_librivox/castlesinair_12_orczy_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1827}, {"section": 13, "title": "Chapter VI - Honour among ----- Pt 2", "readers": [2234], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/castles_in_the_air_lr_librivox/castlesinair_13_orczy_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1493}, {"section": 14, "title": "Chapter VII - An Over-sensitive Heart Pt 1", "readers": [2234], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/castles_in_the_air_lr_librivox/castlesinair_14_orczy_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1550}, {"section": 15, "title": "Chapter VII - An Over-sensitive Heart Pt 2", "readers": [2234], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/castles_in_the_air_lr_librivox/castlesinair_15_orczy_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2246}]}
