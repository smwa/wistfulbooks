{"title": "Johann Sebastian Bach", "description": "Compared with the unimaginable richness of his inner life as the overpowering volume and splendor of his works reveal it, Bach\u2019s day-to-day existence seems almost pedestrian....  The present volume, which advances no claim whatever to any new or original slant, aims to do no more than furnish for those who read and run a meager background of a few isolated highspots in Bach\u2019s outward life and a momentary sideglance at a tiny handful of his supreme creations. Its object will have been more than accomplished if in any manner it stimulates a radio listener to deepen his acquaintance with Bach\u2019s immeasurable art. - Summary by Author's Foreword", "duration": 4772, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "11414", "name": "Herbert Francis Peyser"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt22/bach_1607.jpg", "copyright_year": "1950", "genres": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "David Wales"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "David Wales"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Ann Boulais"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "DaveC"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Foreword", "readers": [6454], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/johann_sebastian_bach_dw_1607_librivox/johannsebastianbach_00_peyser_64kb.mp3", "duration": 99}, {"section": 1, "title": "Part 1: Opening; Son Of A Court Musician; Early Years In School; Student At Lueneburg; Organist At Arnstadt", "readers": [6454], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/johann_sebastian_bach_dw_1607_librivox/johannsebastianbach_01_peyser_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1234}, {"section": 2, "title": "Part 2: Inspiration From The Master, Buxtehude; Year At Muehlhausen; Weimer", "readers": [6454], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/johann_sebastian_bach_dw_1607_librivox/johannsebastianbach_02_peyser_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1249}, {"section": 3, "title": "Part 3: Kapellmeister With Prince Leopold; Leipzig And The St. John Passion; Bach\u2019s Greater Work; St. Matthew Passion And B MinorMass; Visit To Frederick The Great And Later Works; Death", "readers": [6454], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/johann_sebastian_bach_dw_1607_librivox/johannsebastianbach_03_peyser_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2190}]}
