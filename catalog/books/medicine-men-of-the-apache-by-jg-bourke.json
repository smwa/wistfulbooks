{"title": "Medicine-Men Of The Apache", "description": "\u201cHerewith I have the honor to submit a paper upon the paraphernalia of the medicine-men of the Apache and other tribes. Analogues have been pointed out, wherever possible, especially in the case of the hoddentin and the izze-kloth, which have never to my knowledge previously received treatment.\u201d (Letter of Transmittal). Bourke was a Medal of Honor awardee in the American Civil War whose subsequent Army career included several campaigns in the Indian wars of the mid to late 19th century in the American West. He wrote prolifically. He was mostly free of the unfortunate disdain for Native Americans common in 19th century America. He was quite admiring of many aspects of the Native American. \u201c\u2026 Bourke had the opportunity to witness every facet of life in the Old West\u2014the battles, wildlife, the internal squabbling among the military, the Indian Agency, settlers, and Native Americans.\u201d (It is germane to note that this is a scholarly paper with many, many quotations wherein it is difficult to differentiate aurally between the quoted words and the author's words. Also, that the author often goes far afield from the Apache in drawing parallels in other cultures around the world.) - Summary by David Wales", "duration": 25448, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "16030", "name": "John Gregory Bourke"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/medicine-men_of_the_apache_2105_librivox/medicinemanapache_2105.jpg", "copyright_year": "1892", "genres": ["Medical", "Social Science (Culture & Anthropology)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "David Wales"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "David Wales"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "DaveC"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "DaveC"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Letter of Transmittal 1891", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/medicine-men_of_the_apache_2105_librivox/medicinemenapache_00_bourke_64kb.mp3", "duration": 71}, {"section": 1, "title": "The medicine-men, their modes of treating disease, their superstitions, paraphernalia, etc.", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/medicine-men_of_the_apache_2105_librivox/medicinemenapache_01_bourke_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3214}, {"section": 2, "title": "Medicine-women; Remedies and modes of treatment; Hair and wigs: Mudheads; Scalp shirts; The rhombus, or bull roarer; The cross", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/medicine-men_of_the_apache_2105_librivox/medicinemenapache_02_bourke_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2220}, {"section": 3, "title": "Necklaces of human fingers; Necklaces of human teeth; The scratch stick; The drinking reed", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/medicine-men_of_the_apache_2105_librivox/medicinemenapache_03_bourke_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3101}, {"section": 4, "title": "Hoddentin, the pollen of the tule, the sacrificial powder of the Apache; with remarks upon sacred powders and offerings in general; The 'kunque' of the Zuni and others", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/medicine-men_of_the_apache_2105_librivox/medicinemenapache_04_bourke_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3291}, {"section": 5, "title": "Use of the pollen by the Israelites and Egyptians; Hoddentin a prehistoric food; Hoddentin the yiauhtli of the Aztecs; 'Bkedos' of ancient writrs - its meaning; Tzoalli; General use of the powder among Indians; Analogues of hoddentin; The down of birds in ceremonial observances; Hair powder; Dust from churches - its use", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/medicine-men_of_the_apache_2105_librivox/medicinemenapache_05_bourke_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3935}, {"section": 6, "title": "Clay-eating; Prehistoric foods used in covenants; Sacred breads and cakes; Unleavened bread; The hot cross buns of Good Friday; Galena", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/medicine-men_of_the_apache_2105_librivox/medicinemenapache_06_bourke_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2063}, {"section": 7, "title": "The izze-kloth or medicine cord of the Apache; Analogues to be found among the Aztecs, Peruvians, and others; The magic win-knotted cords of the Lapps and others", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/medicine-men_of_the_apache_2105_librivox/medicinemenapache_07_bourke_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1686}, {"section": 8, "title": "Rosaries and other mnemonic cords; The sacred cords of the Parsis and Brahmans", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/medicine-men_of_the_apache_2105_librivox/medicinemenapache_08_bourke_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1750}, {"section": 9, "title": "Use of cords and knots and girdles in parturition; 'Medidas', 'measuring cords', 'wresting threads', etc.", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/medicine-men_of_the_apache_2105_librivox/medicinemenapache_09_bourke_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1773}, {"section": 10, "title": "The medicine hat; The spirit or ghost dance headdress; Amulets and talismans, the 'tzi-daltai'", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/medicine-men_of_the_apache_2105_librivox/medicinemenapache_10_bourke_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1258}, {"section": 11, "title": "Chalchihuitl; Phylacteries", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/medicine-men_of_the_apache_2105_librivox/medicinemenapache_11_bourke_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1086}]}
