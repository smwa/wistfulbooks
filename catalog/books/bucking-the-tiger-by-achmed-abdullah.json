{"title": "Bucking the Tiger", "description": "A group of down-and-outers decide on the ultimate gamble: they will bankroll one of themselves, chosen by lot, to live well for a year. Then the one chosen must commit suicide after that year, so that the others can cash in on his life insurance policy. Complications arise when the \"lucky winner\" finds an unexpected turn in his fortunes. How can he get out of it with his honor intact, or will he \"welch\" on the deal? \r\n<br><br>\r\n\"Bucking the tiger\" refers to the game of Faro, one of the most popular card games played in saloons and gambling halls in the 1800s. The name is thought to have come from early card backs that featured a drawing of a Bengal tiger.
