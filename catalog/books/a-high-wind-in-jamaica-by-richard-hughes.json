{"title": "High Wind in Jamaica", "description": "Childhood and piracy: an unlikely pairing, in a tragi-comic adventure. Neither Treasure Island nor Peter Pan prepares one for the kind of delight afforded by A High Wind in Jamaica. Hughes\u2019 pirates fit no preconceived model. They are preeminently men, with vivid and differing personalities, and puzzling relationships\u2014with one another and with the children in their (grudging) charge. They are only secondarily pirates, although the world outside their schooner sees them as pirates first, as men not at all, and certainly not as the babysitters we know them to be.\r\n\r\nAs for the children, Hughes gives a hint of his unconventional view of childhood in one casual remark: \u201cbabies are, after all, one of the most developed species of the lower vertebrates.\u201d There are no actual infants in the novel, but there are young children, whose minds are strange, alien landscapes which most adults have forgotten.\r\n\r\nHughes defies adults\u2019 illusions about those early, \u201cinnocent\u201d years. The children he depicts are troubled and often confused but resilient; they adapt almost instantaneously to drastic changes in their circumstances and others\u2019 behavior. They are decisive yet inconsistent, curious yet readily distracted, prudish yet savage, capable of fierce love and easy betrayal.\r\n\r\nA reader who longs for stereotyping can find a bit of it in Hughes\u2019 depiction of that class called parents, where it suffers his withering ridicule. But these are the beings ultimately in charge of society, and by the end of the book a reader does not know whether to rejoice or grieve that the children will grow up to join them.\r\n\r\n(Summary by Thomas A.
