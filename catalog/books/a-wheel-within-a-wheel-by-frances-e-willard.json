{"title": "Wheel Within A Wheel", "description": "Frances Willard was an influential campaigner and educator for social reforms, temperance and women's education, suffrage and empowerment, as shown in her motto \"Do everything\".  She was a long-serving national president of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU, also known as the \"white ribbon\" movement) and famous in many countries for her writings and speaking tours.  This little book is a wryly humorous account of \"How I Learned to Ride the Bicycle\", something she achieved at the age of 53 and of which she was very proud!  In it, she incorporates  a strong encouragement to young girls and women to educate themselves in and pursue whatever role they feel an aptitude for, along with her firm Christian values and amusing anecdotes - Summary by Anne Fletcher", "duration": 4652, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "14598", "name": "Frances E.
