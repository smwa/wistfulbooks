{"title": "Gargantua and Pantagruel, Book II", "description": "<i>The Life of Gargantua and of Pantagruel</i> (in French, La vie de Gargantua et de Pantagruel) is a connected series of five novels written in the 16th century by Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais. It is the story of two giants, a father (Gargantua) and his son (Pantagruel) and their adventures, written in an amusing, extravagant, satirical vein. There is much crudity and scatological humor as well as a large amount of violence. Long lists of vulgar insults fill several chapters.
