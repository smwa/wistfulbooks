{"title": "Flexner Report. Medical Education In The United States And Canada", "description": "The Flexner Report is a book-length review and investigation into medical education in the United States and Canada, written by Abraham Flexner and published in 1910 under the aegis of the Carnegie Foundation. The report concluded that the professional standard of medical science teaching and practice in America was below par compared to Europe, and was overconfident in the abundance of doctors as a false sign of strength. Many colleges and universities were found to be without merit, or lacking academic integrity, and not following a regulated standard. The quality of the training was often self reported and not under scrutiny, usually lacking in work experience or a review of skill. All too often the teaching staff were not involved in research, nor were working consistently in the medical profession, and preferred easy delivery lectures instead of  the expense of training in a clinic. The report recommends many medical schools be closed, higher prerequisite standards for entry into medical studies, and stricter state regulation. - Summary by Leon Harvey", "duration": 55482, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "18330", "name": "Abraham Flexner"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/flexnerreport_2504_librivox/flexner_2504.jpg", "copyright_year": "1910", "genres": ["Education", "Medical", "Modern (20th C)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Leon Harvey"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Leon Harvey"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Christine Rottger"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Christine Rottger"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Introduction", "readers": [10851], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/flexnerreport_2504_librivox/flexnermedicaleduscanada_00_flexner_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1913}, {"section": 1, "title": "I.
