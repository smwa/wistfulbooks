{"title": "Present Crisis", "description": "James Russell Lowell was an American Romantic poet, critic, editor, and diplomat. He is associated with the Fireside Poets, a group of New England writers who were among the first American poets who rivaled the popularity of British poets. These poets usually used conventional forms and meters in their poetry, making them suitable for families entertaining at their fireside.</br></br>\n\n\"Lowell's poem \"The Present Crisis,\" an early work that addressed the national crisis over slavery leading up to the Civil War, has had an impact in the modern civil rights movement. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People named its newsletter The Crisis after the poem, and Martin Luther King, Jr. frequently quoted the poem in his speeches and sermons. The poem was also the source of the hymn Once to Every Man and Nation.\" - Summary by Wikipedia", "duration": 3608, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "1204", "name": "James Russell Lowell"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/the_present_crisis_1512.poem_librivox/presentcrisis_1512.jpg", "copyright_year": "0", "genres": ["Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "The Present Crisis - Read by BK", "readers": [8786], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/the_present_crisis_1512.poem_librivox/presentcrisis_lowell_bk_64kb.mp3", "duration": 537}, {"section": 2, "title": "The Present Crisis - Read by BSD", "readers": [10402], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/the_present_crisis_1512.poem_librivox/presentcrisis_lowell_bsd_64kb.mp3", "duration": 435}, {"section": 3, "title": "The Present Crisis - Read by EL", "readers": [9872], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/the_present_crisis_1512.poem_librivox/presentcrisis_lowell_el_64kb.mp3", "duration": 436}, {"section": 4, "title": "The Present Crisis - Read by GG", "readers": [8011], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/the_present_crisis_1512.poem_librivox/presentcrisis_lowell_gg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 557}, {"section": 5, "title": "The Present Crisis - Read by LLW", "readers": [4738], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/the_present_crisis_1512.poem_librivox/presentcrisis_lowell_llw_64kb.mp3", "duration": 588}, {"section": 6, "title": "The Present Crisis - Read by MK", "readers": [8051], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/the_present_crisis_1512.poem_librivox/presentcrisis_lowell_mk_64kb.mp3", "duration": 479}, {"section": 7, "title": "The Present Crisis - Read by SOTE", "readers": [8879], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/the_present_crisis_1512.poem_librivox/presentcrisis_lowell_sote_64kb.mp3", "duration": 576}]}
