{"title": "Bible (WNT) NT 09: Galatians", "description": "Some have compared Paul's Letter to the fellowship at Galatia as the \"Magna Carta\" of the liberty of Christians.  It is Paul's passionate defense against a sect known as Judaizers, who insisted Christ's followers were still required to follow certain Old Testament laws and observances to the letter.  Paul says otherwise, and urges the brothers and sisters of the Galatian ecclesia to \"stick to their guns\" and continue to follow the path of Christ, where faith, not the legal requirements of Mosaic law, is the path into the Kingdom of God through Jesus Christ.   - Summary by Mark Penfold", "duration": 1420, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "4721", "name": " Weymouth New Testament"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/bible_wnt_nt_09_galatians_1702_librivox/wnt_galatians_1703.jpg", "copyright_year": "1903", "genres": ["Bibles"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Mark Penfold"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Mark Penfold"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Amy Gramour"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Larry Wilson"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Galatians", "readers": [2149], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/bible_wnt_nt_09_galatians_1702_librivox/galatians_01_weymouth_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1420}]}
