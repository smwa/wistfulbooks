{"title": "Girl From the Marsh Croft", "description": "Readers of Miss Lagerl\u00f6f will observe that in this, her latest book, \"The Girl from the Marsh Croft,\" the Swedish author has abandoned her former world of Romanticism and has entered the field of Naturalism and Realism. <br /><br />\n\nThis writer's romantic style is most marked, perhaps, in her first successful work, \"G\u00f6sta Berling.\" \nHow \"The Story of G\u00f6sta Berling\" grew, and the years required to perfect it, is told in the author's unique literary autobiography, \"The Story of a Story,\" which is embodied in the present volume. <br /><br />\n\nIn \"The Girl from the Marsh Croft\" Miss Lagerl\u00f6f has courageously chosen a girl who had gone astray as the heroine of her love story, making her innate honesty and goodness the redemptive qualities which win for her the love of an honest man and the respect and esteem of all. (This novella is one of nine short stories included in this collection.) <br /><br />\n\nTo the kindness of the publishers of Good Housekeeping, I am indebted for permission to include \"The Legend of the Christmas Rose\" in this volume. <br /><br />\n\nThis book is translated and published with the sanction of the author, Selma Lagerl\u00f6f. - (Prefatory note from the etext)", "duration": 21912, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "176", "name": "Selma Lagerl\u00f6f"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/the_girl_from_the_marsh_croft_1607_librivox/girl_marsh_croft_1607.jpg", "copyright_year": "1916", "genres": ["Published 1900 onward"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Lars Rolander (1942-2016)"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Elli"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Elli"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "The Girl from the Marsh Croft - Chapter I", "readers": [2234], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/girl_from_the_marsh_croft_1607_librivox/girlfromthemarshcroft_01_lagerloef_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1032}, {"section": 2, "title": "The Girl from the Marsh Croft - Chapter II", "readers": [2234], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/girl_from_the_marsh_croft_1607_librivox/girlfromthemarshcroft_02_lagerloef_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1672}, {"section": 3, "title": "The Girl from the Marsh Croft - Chapter III", "readers": [2234], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/girl_from_the_marsh_croft_1607_librivox/girlfromthemarshcroft_03_lagerloef_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1350}, {"section": 4, "title": "The Girl from the Marsh Croft - Chapter IV", "readers": [2234], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/girl_from_the_marsh_croft_1607_librivox/girlfromthemarshcroft_04_lagerloef_64kb.mp3", "duration": 462}, {"section": 5, "title": "The Girl from the Marsh Croft - Chapter V - Part 1", "readers": [2234], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/girl_from_the_marsh_croft_1607_librivox/girlfromthemarshcroft_05_lagerloef_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1191}, {"section": 6, "title": "The Girl from the Marsh Croft - Chapter V - Part 2", "readers": [2234], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/girl_from_the_marsh_croft_1607_librivox/girlfromthemarshcroft_06_lagerloef_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1319}, {"section": 7, "title": "The Girl from the Marsh Croft - Chapter VI", "readers": [2234], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/girl_from_the_marsh_croft_1607_librivox/girlfromthemarshcroft_07_lagerloef_64kb.mp3", "duration": 957}, {"section": 8, "title": "The Silver Mine", "readers": [2234], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/girl_from_the_marsh_croft_1607_librivox/girlfromthemarshcroft_08_lagerloef_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1948}, {"section": 9, "title": "The Airship - Part 1", "readers": [2234], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/girl_from_the_marsh_croft_1607_librivox/girlfromthemarshcroft_09_lagerloef_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1723}, {"section": 10, "title": "The Airship - Part 2", "readers": [2234], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/girl_from_the_marsh_croft_1607_librivox/girlfromthemarshcroft_10_lagerloef_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1401}, {"section": 11, "title": "The Wedding March", "readers": [2234], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/girl_from_the_marsh_croft_1607_librivox/girlfromthemarshcroft_11_lagerloef_64kb.mp3", "duration": 698}, {"section": 12, "title": "The Musician", "readers": [2234], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/girl_from_the_marsh_croft_1607_librivox/girlfromthemarshcroft_12_lagerloef_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1215}, {"section": 13, "title": "The Legend of the Christmas Rose", "readers": [2234], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/girl_from_the_marsh_croft_1607_librivox/girlfromthemarshcroft_13_lagerloef_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2372}, {"section": 14, "title": "A Story from Jerusalem", "readers": [2234], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/girl_from_the_marsh_croft_1607_librivox/girlfromthemarshcroft_14_lagerloef_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1253}, {"section": 15, "title": "Why the Pope Lived to be so Old", "readers": [4705], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/girl_from_the_marsh_croft_1607_librivox/girlfromthemarshcroft_15_lagerloef_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1655}, {"section": 16, "title": "The Story of a Story", "readers": [4705], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/girl_from_the_marsh_croft_1607_librivox/girlfromthemarshcroft_16_lagerloef_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1664}]}
