{"title": "Art of Money Getting (version 2)", "description": "Although Barnum considered himself primarily a showman and his main goal was to put money in his own pocket, this little book, subtitled Golden Rules for Making Money does have a good deal of common sense about how to make money, and perhaps more importantly, how to keep it once you've made it. Of course, having been written nearly a century and a half ago, some of the advice may be a little dated, but it remains a very readable self-help book.
