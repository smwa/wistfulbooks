{"title": "Aphorisms", "description": "In 1894, Oscar Wilde (1854 - 1900) published two collections of aphorisms:  <em>A Few Maxims For The Instruction Of The Over-Educated</em>, in the Saturday Review newspaper, and <em>Phrases and Philosophies for the Use of the Young</em>, in the Oxford student magazine The Chameleon. By turns witty, intellectual, counter-intuitive and obtruse, the collections came to be seen by many as emblematic of Wilde's style, and countless collections of Wildean aphorisms have since been published.
