{"title": "October and Other Poems", "description": "This is a collection of poetry by Robert Bridges. This collection also contains some poems written right after World War I, reflecting the state of international politics very impressively. <br></br>\"This miscellaneous volume is composed of three sections. The first twelve poems were written in 1913, and printed privately by Mr. Hornby in 1914.<br>\nThe last of these poems proved to be a \u201cwar poem,\u201d and on that follow eighteen pieces which were called forth on occasion during the War, the last being a broadsheet on the surrender of the German ships. All of these verses appeared in some journal or serial. There were a few others, but they are not included in this collection, either because they are lost, or because they show decidedly inferior claims to salvage.<br>\nThe last six poems or sonnets are of various dates.\" - Summary by Carolin", "duration": 4537, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "277", "name": "Robert Bridges"}], "coverArt":
