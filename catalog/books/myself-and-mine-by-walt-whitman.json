{"title": "Myself and Mine", "description": "LibriVox volunteers bring you 9 recordings of Myself And Mine by Walt Whitman.<br>\r\nThis was the Fortnightly Poetry project for October 12, 2025.   <br> ------<br>\r\nThis Fortnightly Poem is from the collection, Leaves of Grass. The book represents a celebration of Whitman's philosophy of life and humanity in which he praises nature and the individual's role in it. He catalogues the expansiveness of American democracy.  Rather than dwell on religious or spiritual themes, he focuses primarily on the body and the material world. With very few exceptions, Whitman's poems do not rhyme or follow conventional rules for meter and line length. - Summary by Wikipedia", "duration": 1905, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "588", "name": "Walt Whitman"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/myselfandmine_2510.poem_librivox/myselfandmine_2510.jpg", "genres": ["Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "David Lawrence"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Myself and Mine - read by AKW", "readers": [9338], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/myselfandmine_2510.poem_librivox/myselfandmine_whitman_akw_64kb.mp3", "duration": 189}, {"section": 2, "title": "Myself and Mine - read by DBG", "readers": [14439], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/myselfandmine_2510.poem_librivox/myselfandmine_whitman_dbg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 218}, {"section": 3, "title": "Myself and Mine - read by DC", "readers": [16764], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/myselfandmine_2510.poem_librivox/myselfandmine_whitman_dc_64kb.mp3", "duration": 199}, {"section": 4, "title": "Myself and Mine - read by DL", "readers": [2911], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/myselfandmine_2510.poem_librivox/myselfandmine_whitman_dl_64kb.mp3", "duration": 216}, {"section": 5, "title": "Myself and Mine - read by DLS", "readers": [15365], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/myselfandmine_2510.poem_librivox/myselfandmine_whitman_dls_64kb.mp3", "duration": 223}, {"section": 6, "title": "Myself and Mine - read by JK", "readers": [19242], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/myselfandmine_2510.poem_librivox/myselfandmine_whitman_jk_64kb.mp3", "duration": 187}, {"section": 7, "title": "Myself and Mine - read by PFS", "readers": [8576], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/myselfandmine_2510.poem_librivox/myselfandmine_whitman_pfs_64kb.mp3", "duration": 203}, {"section": 8, "title": "Myself and Mine - read by PLM", "readers": [13243], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/myselfandmine_2510.poem_librivox/myselfandmine_whitman_plm_64kb.mp3", "duration": 222}, {"section": 9, "title": "Myself and Mine - read by REA", "readers": [6535], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/myselfandmine_2510.poem_librivox/myselfandmine_whitman_rea_64kb.mp3", "duration": 248}]}
