{"title": "Man's World", "description": "The mysterious Frank Ware is a woman writer forced to write under a masculine pseudonym in order to win literary respect. Adding to her enigmatic status is the fact that she lives in New York City with her adopted child, a little son of unknown parentage, mystifying her friends by spending all her spare time in the least savory parts of the City, trying to rescue prostitutes from their hard lives. Eventually, even her closest bohemian and artistic companions begin to ask awkward questions, driving her to difficult, life-changing revelations.<br /><br />\n\n\u201cA Man\u2019s World\u201d embodies some of Rachel Crothers\u2019 most passionate ideas about the relations between men and women; the double standards used to judge behavior; the dangers of romantic Love; the stifling, philistine prejudices still present even among the most progressive and free-thinking members of American society. Frank Ware stands as a remarkable character in the literature of the early 20th century, a free-minded, strong, and independent woman willing to stand fast on her ideals even at great personal sacrifice.\n(Expatriate)", "duration": 8003, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "9905", "name": "Rachel Crothers"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/mans_world_1601_librivox/mans_world_1601.jpg", "copyright_year": "1915", "genres": ["Plays"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Expatriate"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Expatriate"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Annise"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "DaveC"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Act I", "readers": [8713], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/mans_world_1601_librivox/amansworld_01_crothers_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3118}, {"section": 2, "title": "Act II", "readers": [8713], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/mans_world_1601_librivox/amansworld_02_crothers_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2183}, {"section": 3, "title": "Act III", "readers": [8713], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/mans_world_1601_librivox/amansworld_03_crothers_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2053}, {"section": 4, "title": "Act IV", "readers": [8713], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/mans_world_1601_librivox/amansworld_04_crothers_64kb.mp3", "duration": 649}]}
