{"title": "Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners", "description": "Grace Abounding is the spiritual autobiography of John Bunyan, who also penned Pilgrim\u2019s Progress, perhaps one of the most significant pieces of Christian literature, second only to the Bible. Grace Abounding follows Bunyan\u2019s struggle to find true repentance and forgiveness, his battle with Satan\u2019s temptations of unbelief, his comfort found in the Bible and his overarching victory gotten by the grace of God through Jesus Christ his Son. Readers familiar with Pilgrim\u2019s Progress will recognize that many of the allegorical points in his famous work came out of Bunyan\u2019s own struggles and discoveries, and it has been said that Bunyan could not have written Pilgrim\u2019s Progress without first going through the battles chronicled in Grace Abounding.
