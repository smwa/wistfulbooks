{"title": "Speaking Voice", "description": "From the Preface of <i>The Speaking Voice: principles of training simplified and condensed</i>: \"This book offers a method of voice training which is the result of a deliberate effort to simplify and condense, for general use, the principles which are fundamental to all recognized systems of vocal instruction. It contains practical directions accompanied by simple and fundamental exercises, first for the freeing of the voice and then for developing it when free.\"<br /><br />Parts I and II of the book comprise advice on vocal production and techniques, while some chapters in Part III provide detailed guidance on the vocal interpretation of various literary genres, including the essay, various types of poetry, short stories, dramatic monologues and plays. Some chapters comprise mainly examples for practice, and include complete poems and stories.<br /><br />The reader has endeavoured to follow the author's instructions, but makes no guarantee as to her success, especially in the poetic realm.", "duration": 18496, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "2746", "name": "Katherine Jewell Everts"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt20/speaking_voice_1206.jpg", "copyright_year": "1908", "genres": ["Performing Arts"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Ruth Golding"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Ruth Golding"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Ruth Golding"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Bev J Stevens"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "00 Preface and Introduction", "readers": [2607], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/speaking_voice_rg_librivox/speakingvoice_00_everts_64kb.mp3", "duration": 382}, {"section": 1, "title": "01 Pt.
