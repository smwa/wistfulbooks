{"title": "Lockerbie Street", "description": "LibriVox volunteers bring you 16 recordings of Lockerbie Street by James Whitcomb Riley.<br>\r\nThis was the Fortnightly Poetry project for August 28, 2022. <br> ------<br>\r\nJames Whitcomb Riley was an American writer and poet, who lived in Indianapolis. Here among his books and his souvenirs, the poet spent his happy and contented days. To reach this restful spot, the pilgrim must journey to Lockerbie Street, a miniature thoroughfare half hidden between two more commanding avenues. It is little more than a lane, shaded, unpaved, and from end to end no longer than a five minutes' walk, but its fame is for all time.
