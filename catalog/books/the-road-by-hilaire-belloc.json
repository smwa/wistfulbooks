{"title": "Road", "description": "\"We are arrived at a chief turning-point in the history of the English highway. New instruments of locomotion, a greater volume of traffic, a greater weight in loads, and vastly increased rapidity in road travel have between them brought us to an issue: either some very considerable and immediate change in the character of the Road, or a serious and increasing handicap in our rivalry with other nations through the strain and expense of an out-worn system.<br>\r\n\"The moment therefore calls for some examination of the Road, its theory and history. That need has prompted me to write this essay; but I must say at the outset that I approach my task with no expert qualification. My only equipment for the general sketch I intend is historical reading and the experience acquired in the writing of certain monographs upon the topography of the Road in the past. I can do no more than suggest lines of thought which, if they lead to practice, need a detailed science I do not possess. ...<br>\r\n\"We have had (as I shall develop in more detail) five great moments ... in the history of the English road system: the moment when the British trackway was superseded by the Roman military road; the moment when the latter declined in the Dark Ages; the moment when the mediaeval system of local roads grew up on the basis of the old Roman trunk roads and around them; the moment when this in its turn declined in the later sixteenth and seventeenth centuries; and the re-casting of the road system by the turnpikes of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. To-day the sixth great change is upon us.<br>\r\n\"It is incumbent upon us then to-day to get ourselves clear upon the theory and the history of the Road, and I propose in this essay to take them in two sections: first, the Road in general; next, that special institution the English Road.\" - From the introduction<br><br>\r\nListeners are encouraged to access the online text of this book at Project Gutenberg in order to view the excellent maps and diagrams that enrich the text.", "duration": 15775, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "156", "name": "Hilaire Belloc"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/theroad_2303_librivox/road_2303.jpg", "copyright_year": "1923", "genres": ["Social Science (Culture & Anthropology)", "Transportation"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Devorah Allen"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Devorah Allen"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Devorah Allen"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Introductory Material", "readers": [11084], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/theroad_2303_librivox/theroad_00_belloc_64kb.mp3", "duration": 501}, {"section": 1, "title": "Part 1: The Road in General.
