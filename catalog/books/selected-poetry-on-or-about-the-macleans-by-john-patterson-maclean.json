{"title": "Selected Poetry on or about the MacLeans", "description": "\"Gifted with poesy as are the Highlanders, and given to the praise of their country and their leaders, it would be expected that many poems would still be extant concerning the MacLeans and their ancestral dominions,\" wrote John Patterson MacLean in his \"A History of the Clan MacLean,\"  These selections, collected and arranged by J.P. Maclean comprise part of Note C of MacLean's treatise (pp. 406-452), although they were written by different authors for different reasons. Dealing with incidents experienced by the MacLeans throughout their long history this highland poetry reveals, in ways the historical narrative cannot, the feeling behind the actions of the MacLeans and the reactions to their activities. - Summary by DrPGould", "duration": 11184, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "13222", "name": "John Patterson MacLean"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/selectedpoetry_macleans_1803_librivox/poetry_macleans_1803.jpg", "copyright_year": "1889", "genres": ["Poetry"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "DrPGould"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "DrPGould"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "J.
