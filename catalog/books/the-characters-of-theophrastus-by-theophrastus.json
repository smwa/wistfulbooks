{"title": "Characters Of Theophrastus", "description": "Theophrastus ( c. 371 \u2013 c. 287 BC) was an ancient Greek philosopher, successor to Aristotle in the Peripatetic School.   He wrote on many topics:  biology, geology, physics, metaphysics, psychology, ethics, logic \u2013 and more.  His book Characters\u2026 contains thirty brief, vigorous, and trenchant outlines of moral types, which form a most valuable picture of the life of his time, and in fact of human nature in general. They are the first recorded attempt at systematic character writing.  \u201cApart from slight variations of local coloring and institutions, the descriptions of the old Greek philosopher might apply almost as well to the present inhabitants of London or Boston as to the Athenians of 300 B.C.\u201d  This edition contains an extensive and informative introduction to the man and his thought.  - Summary by Book Introduction, Wikipedia, and David Wales", "duration": 5455, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "12773", "name": " Theophrastus"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/the_characters_of_theophrastus_1901_librivox/charactersoftheophrastus_1901.jpg", "copyright_year": "1902", "genres": ["Psychology", "Ancient"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "David Wales"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "David Wales"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "DaveC"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "DaveC"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Preface; Introduction; Epistle Dedicatory", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_characters_of_theophrastus_1901_librivox/charactersoftheophrastus_00_theophrastus_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2058}, {"section": 1, "title": "Part 1:  The Dissembler; The Flatterer; The Coward; The Over-Zealous Man; The Tactless Man; The Shameless Man; The Newsmonger; The Mean Man; The Stupid Man; The Surly Man.", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_characters_of_theophrastus_1901_librivox/charactersoftheophrastus_01_theophrastus_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1128}, {"section": 2, "title": "Part 2:  The Superstitious Man; The Thankless Man; The Suspicious Man; The Disagreeable Man; The Exquisite; The Garrulous Man; The Bore; The Rough; The Affable Man; The Impudent Man.", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_characters_of_theophrastus_1901_librivox/charactersoftheophrastus_02_theophrastus_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1116}, {"section": 3, "title": "Part 3:  The Gross Man; The Boor; The Penurious Man; The Pompous Man; The Braggart; The Oligarch; The Backbiter; The Avaricious Man; The Late Learner; The Vicious Man.", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_characters_of_theophrastus_1901_librivox/charactersoftheophrastus_03_theophrastus_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1153}]}
