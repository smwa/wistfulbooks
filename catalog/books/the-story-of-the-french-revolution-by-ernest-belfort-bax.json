{"title": "Story of the French Revolution", "description": "Preface Excerpt: \"The following sketch of the course of the French Revolution was originally published during 1889 in serial form in \"Justice,\" the weekly organ of the Social Democratic Federation. It has been revised, corrected, and, in some parts, added to, for the present re-issue. It need scarcely be said that it in no way pretends to be a complete history of the great political, social, and intellectual movement it describes. The present volume is designed primarily as a guide to those who, not having the time to study larger works on the subject, yet wish during these centennial years to have in a small compass a connected description of the main events of the French Revolution, more especially from the point of view of modern Socialism.\" - Summary by Celine Major", "duration": 13555, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "14092", "name": "Ernest Belfort Bax"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/frenchrevolution_1905_librivox/french_revolution_1905.jpg", "copyright_year": "0", "genres": ["History"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Celine Major"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Celine Major"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "David Olson"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Helen Z.
