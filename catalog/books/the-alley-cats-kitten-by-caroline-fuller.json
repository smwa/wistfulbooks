{"title": "Alley Cat\u2019s Kitten", "description": "\"The Alley Cat took no pride in her own appearance. Indeed, it had been said when she was born that her mother, the blooded tortoise-shell of a beautiful home, had never produced such a terrible kitten. She would not have been allowed to live, if an accident had not deprived her mother of the others. And as she grew up even her own parent saw that she was homely.<br><br>\r\n\r\nIt may be thought that homely cats have no feelings; but this is not the case, for homely cats, like plain people, are sensitive, and have even more feelings than others. So one day when some particularly unkind remark had been made about the brindled kitten with yellow sides, she left her home and ran away to become an alley cat.\"   - Summary by the author", "duration": 13252, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "17089", "name": "Caroline Fuller"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/thealleycatskitten_2212_librivox/alleycat_2212.jpg", "copyright_year": "1904", "genres": ["Animals & Nature"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Rich Brown"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "The Alley Cat", "readers": [17246], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/thealleycatskitten_2212_librivox/alleycatskitten_01_fuller_64kb.mp3", "duration": 440}, {"section": 2, "title": "The Alley Cat\u2019s Kitten", "readers": [17246], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/thealleycatskitten_2212_librivox/alleycatskitten_02_fuller_64kb.mp3", "duration": 719}, {"section": 3, "title": "The Black Rabbit with White Spots, and the White Rabbit with Black Spots", "readers": [17246], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/thealleycatskitten_2212_librivox/alleycatskitten_03_fuller_64kb.mp3", "duration": 873}, {"section": 4, "title": "A Calico Cat", "readers": [16764], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/thealleycatskitten_2212_librivox/alleycatskitten_04_fuller_64kb.mp3", "duration": 909}, {"section": 5, "title": "Mr. and Mrs. Blueberry", "readers": [17500], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/thealleycatskitten_2212_librivox/alleycatskitten_05_fuller_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1117}, {"section": 6, "title": "Uncle Cyclone", "readers": [17500], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/thealleycatskitten_2212_librivox/alleycatskitten_06_fuller_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1017}, {"section": 7, "title": "The Family in the Piano Box", "readers": [17823], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/thealleycatskitten_2212_librivox/alleycatskitten_07_fuller_64kb.mp3", "duration": 969}, {"section": 8, "title": "A Loss and Some Gains", "readers": [17823], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/thealleycatskitten_2212_librivox/alleycatskitten_08_fuller_64kb.mp3", "duration": 632}, {"section": 9, "title": "At the Lake", "readers": [17783], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/thealleycatskitten_2212_librivox/alleycatskitten_09_fuller_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1286}, {"section": 10, "title": "On the Farm", "readers": [17783], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/thealleycatskitten_2212_librivox/alleycatskitten_10_fuller_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1024}, {"section": 11, "title": "The Son of Silver Bell", "readers": [17783], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/thealleycatskitten_2212_librivox/alleycatskitten_11_fuller_64kb.mp3", "duration": 902}, {"section": 12, "title": "Clytie, the Cat with Mittens", "readers": [17783], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/thealleycatskitten_2212_librivox/alleycatskitten_12_fuller_64kb.mp3", "duration": 979}, {"section": 13, "title": "Torn-Nose", "readers": [17246], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/thealleycatskitten_2212_librivox/alleycatskitten_13_fuller_64kb.mp3", "duration": 727}, {"section": 14, "title": "A Visiting Lady", "readers": [17873], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/thealleycatskitten_2212_librivox/alleycatskitten_14_fuller_64kb.mp3", "duration": 796}, {"section": 15, "title": "Octavia", "readers": [17886], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/thealleycatskitten_2212_librivox/alleycatskitten_15_fuller_64kb.mp3", "duration": 630}, {"section": 16, "title": "Christmas Eve", "readers": [13278], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/thealleycatskitten_2212_librivox/alleycatskitten_16_fuller_64kb.mp3", "duration": 232}]}
