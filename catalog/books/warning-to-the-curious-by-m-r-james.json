{"title": "Warning to the Curious and Other Ghost Stories", "description": "From a master of weird fiction comes this collection of ghost stories rooted in the antiquarian pursuits. A doll's house that reveals more than its owner ever wished. Stolen prayer books that prove to be doom for those who seek to purloin them. A piercing shriek in the dead of night. A glimpse into the dark past through a pair of bewitched binoculars. An ancient crown that should have never been unearthed. A burial site cursed by those who died by wickedness. These nightmares may come to haunt your dreams if you should let them in. - Summary by Ben Tucker", "duration": 12290, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "2959", "name": "M. R.
