{"title": "Little Eyolf (Mencken Translation)", "description": "One of the four profound plays of Ibsen\u2019s late period (along with \u201cThe Master Builder,\u201d \u201cJohn Gabriel Borkman,\u201d and \u201cWhen We Dead Awaken\u201d), \u201cLittle Eyolf\u201d tells the story of Albert Allmers, a writer who has yearned to leave behind a literary or philosophical legacy of some kind, but who finally decides to invest that yearning in the life of his little handicapped son, Eyolf. Rita Allmers loves her husband so obsessively that she hates any rival for his affection, whether it be Allmer\u2019s literary magnum opus, Little Eyolf himself, or Albert\u2019s strangely devoted sister Asta. Little Eyolf\u2019s tragic death, possibly orchestrated by the eldritch old Rat-Wife, brings about a psychological climax among the three adults, as they reveal to each other deep conflicts of love and hate, complex erotic desires, raw honesty about their emotional emptiness in the face of human tragedy, and the realization that all that really matters to any one of them is Life itself. The famous H. L. Mencken heads a team effort committed to the colloquial, lucid rendition of this alternative translation.
