{"title": "Short Nonfiction Collection, Vol. 099", "description": "\"Instead of letting ourselves, at the thought of mealtime, fall into a state of chronic mental flutter that incapacitates us for any serious work, let us sit down in advance and calmly plan out the meals for a week\" (Janet Hill, Meat Substitutes, 1910) Menus for meatless meals make meal planning easy, while two essays on chocolate will whet the appetite. Many reader-chosen selections in vol. 099 provide psychological insights into human motivation: Saved by a Nose; Mental Engineering; Training Human Capacities for the New Era; Easter Choir Strikes; From Alien to Citizen; Women as Munition Makers; Meteorology and the State; The Physical Appearance of the Planet Mars; Our Future Policy in Afghanistan; Fraudulent Mediums Act; and Mary Robert Rinehart Shows How Truth is Stranger than Fiction. Vol. 099 also has formal speeches by Presidents Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, and George W. Bush. Rounding out the collection is a cheerful account of birding in San Elizario, Texas.  - Summary by Sue Anderson\r\n<br><br>\r\nNote: \"Our Future Policy in Afghanistan (1886)\" is Appendix II to Colonel Sir Robert Sandeman, His Life and Work on our Indian Frontier (1895) by Thomas Henry Thornton.", "duration": 16724, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "18", "name": " Various"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/snf099_2309_librivox/snf099_2309.jpg", "genres": ["*Non-fiction"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Sue Anderson"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "J.
