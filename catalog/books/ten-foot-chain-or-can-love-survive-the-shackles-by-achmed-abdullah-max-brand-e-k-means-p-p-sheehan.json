{"title": "Ten-foot Chain", "description": "True love can survive anything. Or can it? Four popular authors were lunching with an editor and the question came up: \"What mental and emotional reaction would a man and a woman undergo, linked together by a ten-foot chain, for three days and nights?\" The 4 very popular authors each had strong but divergent opinions of what would happen to such a couple chained together for 3 days and nights. The result was these fascinating stories. Does true love scoff at the small difficulty of constant proximity? Does being 'too close' become an acid that eats away even the bonds of love? What do YOU think would happen if you were to write such a story? Read and find out what these popular and creative authors think.
