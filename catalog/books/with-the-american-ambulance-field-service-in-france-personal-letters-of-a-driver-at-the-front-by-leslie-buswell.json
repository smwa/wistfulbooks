{"title": "With The American Ambulance Field Service In France; Personal Letters Of A Driver At The Front", "description": "This 1915 publication collects letters written by a driver for the American ambulance service. The incidents they relate occurred before the entrance of the United States into World War I as a combatant. \u201cThese letters, according to ordinary ethics in such matters, should not, perhaps, be published. They were merely intended as tributes of friendship and remembrance. Casually written \u2014 in pencil often \u2014 at moments between duties, with no thought of their being destined to any further purpose than that distance and absence might count a little less through the pictures they would give of a day's work far away.\u201d - Summary by Book Preface and David Wales", "duration": 9210, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "12618", "name": "Leslie Buswell"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/americanambulance_1703_librivox/americanambulance_1703.jpg", "copyright_year": "1916", "genres": ["War & Military", "Medical"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "David Wales"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "David Wales"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Sarah Jennings"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "DaveC"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Preface and Introduction", "readers": [6454], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/americanambulance_1703_librivox/americanambulance_00_buswell_64kb.mp3", "duration": 615}, {"section": 1, "title": "Part 1", "readers": [6454], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/americanambulance_1703_librivox/americanambulance_01_buswell_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1982}, {"section": 2, "title": "Part 2", "readers": [6454], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/americanambulance_1703_librivox/americanambulance_02_buswell_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1917}, {"section": 3, "title": "Part 3", "readers": [6454], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/americanambulance_1703_librivox/americanambulance_03_buswell_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1700}, {"section": 4, "title": "Part 4", "readers": [6454], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/americanambulance_1703_librivox/americanambulance_04_buswell_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1587}, {"section": 5, "title": "Part 5", "readers": [6454], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/americanambulance_1703_librivox/americanambulance_05_buswell_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1409}]}
