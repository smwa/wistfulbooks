{"title": "Swanhilde, and other Fairy Tales", "description": "Wilhelm Hauff was a German poet and novelist, perhaps best known for his fairy tales (M\u00e4rchen). Some of his stories, such as the Caliph Stork found in this volume, are popular in German-speaking countries to this day. In this book of fairy tales, we find the tale of the beautiful Swanhilde and various other stand-alone fairy tales, as well as a frame story \"The Caravan\" which includes multiple fairy tales within it. Hauff's freshness and originality shine through in these tales.
