{"title": "Early Cave-Men", "description": "The People Who Wanted To Live in Caves. This little book takes us back to the time when our ancestors lived, or wanted to live, in caves. Unfortunately the caves of that time were mostly used by large animals like the Sabre Toothed Tiger and bears who could easily kill and eat our ancestors. Thus the subtitle of this book is The Age of Combat. This book, aimed at children, tries to show how certain things could have taken place to enable our species to eke out a living alongside the much stronger beasts, such as why we wanted to live in caves; the hazards and rewards of living in caves; the taming of fire; and how early tools were invented. This book follows on The Tree Dwellers, and is followed by The Later Cave-Men.  - Summary by Phil Chenevert", "duration": 6962, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "4694", "name": " Katharine Elizabeth Dopp"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/theearlycave-men_2008_librivox/earlycavemen_2008.jpg", "copyright_year": "0", "genres": ["Animals & Nature"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "cadastra"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "1- Why People Wanted to Live in Caves:  2- How the FireClan got a cave; 3- The First Night in the Cave", "readers": [13962], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/theearlycave-men_2008_librivox/earlycave-men_01_dopp_64kb.mp3", "duration": 446}, {"section": 2, "title": "4 - How the Fire Clan Got Rid of Sabre-tooth; 5 - Preparations for the Feast; 6 - The Feast", "readers": [13962], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/theearlycave-men_2008_librivox/earlycave-men_02_dopp_64kb.mp3", "duration": 492}, {"section": 3, "title": "7 - How the Cave was Made Ready for a Winter Home; 8 - How the Cave-men Bored Holes Through Their Trophies; 9 - Making New Weapons", "readers": [13962], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/theearlycave-men_2008_librivox/earlycave-men_03_dopp_64kb.mp3", "duration": 649}, {"section": 4, "title": "10 - How the Women Dressed Sabre-tooth\u2019s Skin 11 - How the Cave-men Made Clothing; 12 - The Fire Clan", "readers": [13382], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/theearlycave-men_2008_librivox/earlycave-men_04_dopp_64kb.mp3", "duration": 471}, {"section": 5, "title": "13 - How the Cave-men Spent the Winter; 14 - What the Cave-men Got from the Birch Trees; 15 - The Flood", "readers": [13382], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/theearlycave-men_2008_librivox/earlycave-men_05_dopp_64kb.mp3", "duration": 749}, {"section": 6, "title": "16 - What the Cave-men Lost in the Flood; 17 - The Council; 18 - The Way to the Fire Country", "readers": [13382], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/theearlycave-men_2008_librivox/earlycave-men_06_dopp_64kb.mp3", "duration": 600}, {"section": 7, "title": "19 - How Firekeeper Made the Skin Water Bag; 20 - Why Firekeeper Made a Door; 21 - The Stranger that Came Toward the Cave", "readers": [14559], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/theearlycave-men_2008_librivox/earlycave-men_07_dopp_64kb.mp3", "duration": 605}, {"section": 8, "title": "22 - The Journey to the Fire Country;  23 - The Return from the Fire Country; 24 - Strongarm Makes a Great Discovery", "readers": [14559], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/theearlycave-men_2008_librivox/earlycave-men_08_dopp_64kb.mp3", "duration": 671}, {"section": 9, "title": "25 - How the Cave-men Received Strongarm; 26 - The Thanksgiving Feast; 27 - What the Women Got from Spruce Trees", "readers": [14559], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/theearlycave-men_2008_librivox/earlycave-men_09_dopp_64kb.mp3", "duration": 565}, {"section": 10, "title": "28 - How the Women Made Splints for Baskets; 29 - How the Women Wove Splints; 30 - How the Women Colored their Baskets", "readers": [14559], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/theearlycave-men_2008_librivox/earlycave-men_10_dopp_64kb.mp3", "duration": 662}, {"section": 11, "title": "31 - How the Cave-men Carried their Burdens; 32 - A Mammoth Hunt; 33 - How the Cave-men Divided the Mammoth", "readers": [14559], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/theearlycave-men_2008_librivox/earlycave-men_11_dopp_64kb.mp3", "duration": 546}, {"section": 12, "title": "34 - Strongarm Tells Firekeeper His Secret;  35 - How People Know What the Cave-men Did", "readers": [14559], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/theearlycave-men_2008_librivox/earlycave-men_12_dopp_64kb.mp3", "duration": 506}]}
