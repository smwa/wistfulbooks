{"title": "Dealings of Captain Sharkey and Other Stories of Pirates", "description": "Notorious pirates who are the scourge of the seven seas, and on land; ghost stories which scare voyagers in the jungles and the ice caps; two ships located in a fatal fight volleying broadsides as if their life depends upon it (which it does); and mysteries on land and the ocean\u2026 Sir Arthur Conan Doyle takes you on a journey with 12 tales as unique and mysterious from one another as were ever collected about those pirates we have come to love\u2026and fear. With enough imagination, cunning and murder to entertain everyone from a salty dog to Ahab\u2019s wife.
