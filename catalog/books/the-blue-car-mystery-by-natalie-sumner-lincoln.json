{"title": "Blue Car Mystery", "description": "The story opens conventionally with a murdered man found on the floor of his library in Washington D.C. As the plot unfolds several possible assailants are discovered. There are the dead man\u2019s fianc\u00e9e and housekeeper, and her hunchback son, his niece whose father needs money and her shell shocked brother; and of these may be responsible.  Or even the lawyer who when summoned by the victim\u2019s niece drove to the scene of the crime in one blue car and drove away in another that later furnished a clue. All of these innocent people are more or less guilty, and one unsuspected person thoroughly so. - Summary by The Book Review Digest v.22 (1927)", "duration": 24335, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "2856", "name": "Natalie Sumner Lincoln"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/bluecarmystery_2512_librivox/bluecarmystery_2512.jpg", "copyright_year": "1926", "genres": ["Detective Fiction"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "James R.
