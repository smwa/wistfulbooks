{"title": "Damned If You Don't", "description": "We've all heard of the wonderful invention that the Big Corporation or the Utilities suppressed?   The one that would revolutionize society with it's simplicity?  Well usually, that Wonderful Invention won't work, actually. But what if there really was one or two like that?  Would the oil industry, or the power conglomerates, or the auto monopolies actually be nasty enough to suppress something that would help the rest of the world just so they could go on making profits?  Well of course they would, silly!   But then there is another possibility, one that is explored in the uniquely wonderful way of Randall Garrett. And one that you may not suspect. And one that may even change your opinions just a bit so watch out.
