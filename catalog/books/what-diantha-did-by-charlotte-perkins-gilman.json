{"title": "What Diantha Did", "description": "Charlotte Perkins Gilman opens a window of history through which we can see a small part of the determined efforts made by women to elevate the circumstances of women in the early 20th century.<br /><br />\nDiantha Bell is a normal young woman desiring marriage and a home, but also a challenging career in a new territory which raises many eyebrows and sets malicious tongues wagging. Her effort to elevate housework and cooking to a regulated and even scientific business, for the relief of homemakers, is a depiction of the late 19th century movement to promote Domestic Science, or Home Economics, as a means of providing more healthful home life, as well as career paths for women.<br /><br />\nDiantha's business prospers as she shows her excellent gifts of administration, organization and homemaking. She grows an empire, and brings happiness and wholesomeness to every area of endeavor which she carefully attempts.<br />The improvements in women's opportunities have not been available very long, indeed.<br />This is a good reminder.", "duration": 22592, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "1736", "name": "Charlotte Perkins Gilman"}], "coverArt": "https://www.archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt15/What_Diantha_Did_1203.jpg", "copyright_year": "1910", "genres": ["General Fiction"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Betsie Bush"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Betsie Bush"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Karen Savage"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Brenda Price"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Handicapped", "readers": [32], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/diantha_0903_librivox/what-diantha-did_01_gilman_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1455}, {"section": 2, "title": "An Unnatural Daughter", "readers": [32], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/diantha_0903_librivox/what-diantha-did_02_gilman_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2070}, {"section": 3, "title": "Breakers", "readers": [32], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/diantha_0903_librivox/what-diantha-did_03_gilman_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1690}, {"section": 4, "title": "A Crying Need", "readers": [32], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/diantha_0903_librivox/what-diantha-did_04_gilman_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1211}, {"section": 5, "title": "Chapter 5", "readers": [32], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/diantha_0903_librivox/what-diantha-did_05_gilman_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1628}, {"section": 6, "title": "The Cynosure", "readers": [32], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/diantha_0903_librivox/what-diantha-did_06_gilman_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1280}, {"section": 7, "title": "Heresy and Schism", "readers": [32], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/diantha_0903_librivox/what-diantha-did_07_gilman_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1469}, {"section": 8, "title": "Chapter 8", "readers": [32], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/diantha_0903_librivox/what-diantha-did_08_gilman_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1254}, {"section": 9, "title": "\"Sleeping In\"", "readers": [32], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/diantha_0903_librivox/what-diantha-did_09_gilman_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1873}, {"section": 10, "title": "Union House", "readers": [32], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/diantha_0903_librivox/what-diantha-did_10_gilman_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1281}, {"section": 11, "title": "The Power of the Screw", "readers": [32], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/diantha_0903_librivox/what-diantha-did_11_gilman_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2621}, {"section": 12, "title": "Like a Banyan Tree", "readers": [32], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/diantha_0903_librivox/what-diantha-did_12_gilman_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1907}, {"section": 13, "title": "All This", "readers": [32], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/diantha_0903_librivox/what-diantha-did_13_gilman_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1531}, {"section": 14, "title": "And Heaven Beside", "readers": [32], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/diantha_0903_librivox/what-diantha-did_14_gilman_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1322}]}
