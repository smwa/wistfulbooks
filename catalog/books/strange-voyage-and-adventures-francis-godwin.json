{"title": "Strange Voyage and Adventures of Domingo Gonsales to the World in the Moon", "description": "Among the earliest sci-fi books known in English, this account of a trip to the moon was originally published in 1638. The version recorded here is an abridged edition published in 1768. Domingo Gonsales is transported to the moon in a machine carried by a flock of geese\u2014go figure\u2014and meets the race of people who live there, whom he calls the Lunars. After a short stay, his geese bring him back to earth, setting him down in China. The book also recounts several other of Gonsales\u2019 adventures before and after his moon trip. Who knew, when President Kennedy said that Americans would land a man on the moon by 1970, that we\u2019d already been there! - Summary by Verla Viera", "duration": 5693, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "2745", "name": "Francis Godwin"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/strangevoyageandadventures_2407_librivox/man_moone_2407.jpg", "copyright_year": "1768", "genres": ["Fantastic Fiction", "Science Fiction"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Verla Viera"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Verla Viera"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "DaveC"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Lynette Caulkins"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Part 1", "readers": [16619], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/strangevoyageandadventures_2407_librivox/strangevoyage_01_godwin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1144}, {"section": 2, "title": "Part 2", "readers": [16619], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/strangevoyageandadventures_2407_librivox/strangevoyage_02_godwin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1036}, {"section": 3, "title": "Part 3", "readers": [16619], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/strangevoyageandadventures_2407_librivox/strangevoyage_03_godwin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1091}, {"section": 4, "title": "Part 4", "readers": [16619], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/strangevoyageandadventures_2407_librivox/strangevoyage_04_godwin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 954}, {"section": 5, "title": "Part 5", "readers": [16619], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/strangevoyageandadventures_2407_librivox/strangevoyage_05_godwin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 861}, {"section": 6, "title": "Appendix", "readers": [16619], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/strangevoyageandadventures_2407_librivox/strangevoyage_06_godwin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 607}]}
