{"title": "Full Speed Ahead: Tales From The Log Of A Correspondent", "description": "\u201cThese tales are memories of several months spent as a special correspondent attached to the forces of the American Navy on foreign service\u2026. [I have] been content to chronicle the interesting incidents of the daily life as well as the achievements and heroisms of the friends who keep the highways of the sea\u2026.  I would not end without a word of thanks to the enlisted men for their unfailing good will and ever courteous behaviour.\u201d  Henry Beston (1888-1968) was an American author.  In 1918, Beston became a press representative for the U.S. Navy. Highlights from this period include being the only American correspondent to travel with the British Grand Fleet and to be aboard an American destroyer during combat engagement and sinking during World War I.  This 1919 book describes these experiences.
