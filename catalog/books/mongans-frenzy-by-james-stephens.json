{"title": "Mongan's Frenzy", "description": "James Stephens is famous for his retellings of Irish myths and fairy tales. This tale is about 1.5 hours in length, full of magical lore and you will spend some considerable time in Faery. It is funny, quirky, fast paced, full of surprises, and sometimes sarcastic, as only James Stephens can be. Stephens also wrote several original novels (The Charwoman's Daughter, The Crock of Gold, Etched in Moonlight, Deirdra, Demi-Gods) also loosely based on Irish fairy tales. Enjoy!
