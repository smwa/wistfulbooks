{"title": "Year Amongst the Persians", "description": "Edward Granville Browne, born in Stouts Hill, Uley, Gloucestershire, England, was a British orientalist who published numerous articles and books of academic value, mainly in the areas of history and literature. His works are respected for their scholarship, uniqueness, and style. He published in areas which few other Western scholars had explored to any sufficient degree. He used a language and style that showed high respect for everybody, even toward those he personally did not view in positive light. In A Year Amongst the Persians (1893) he wrote a sympathetic portrayal of a Persian society which few Westerners had ever seen, including a frank account of the effects of opium. It did not attract the attention it deserved at the time of its initial publication, but after his death in 1926 it was reprinted and became a classic in English travel literature. A Year Amongst the Persians includes moving accounts of the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed community in Iran. Concerning his meetings with the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00eds of Iran, Browne writes: \u201cThe memory of those assemblies can never fade from my mind; the recollection of those faces and those tones no time can efface. I have gazed with awe on the workings of a mighty Spirit, and I marvel whereunto it tends\u201d.<br><br>Edward G. Browne referred to Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00eds as B\u00e1b\u00eds, but this was a mistake on his part. Siyyid \u2018Al\u00ed-Muhammad-i-Sh\u00edr\u00e1z\u00ed (1819-1850), known as the \u201cB\u00e1b\u201d, which is Arabic for \u201cGate\u201d, proclaimed that He was the Promised One of Isl\u00e1m. He declared His mission in 1844 and was executed by the Persian government in 1850. His followers were known as B\u00e1b\u00eds. The B\u00e1b also proclaimed that He was the Gate, Herald and Forerunner of an even greater Manifestation of God who would come after Him, the Promised One of all religions and Return of Christ in the Glory of the Father. In 1863, M\u00edrz\u00e1 Husyan-\u2018Al\u00ed-yi-N\u00far\u00ed (1817-1892), known as Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h (Arabic for \u201cThe Glory of God\u201d), proclaimed that He was the Promised One foretold by the B\u00e1b. By the time Browne arrived in Iran, most B\u00e1b\u00eds had already accepted Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h as the Promised One and were now known as Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00eds. A small group of B\u00e1b\u00eds, led by M\u00edrz\u00e1 Yahy\u00e1 N\u00far\u00ed, known as Azal, who was Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h\u2019s younger half-brother, rejected these claims. Azal is notorious for poisoning his own Brother (i.e. Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h) as well as trying to assassinate other enemies on numerous occasions. While the B\u00e1b had made Azal His nominal successor, this was only until the Promised One were to appear, upon which time Azal\u2019s authority was supposed to cease. Most B\u00e1b\u00eds realised Azal\u2019s depravity and turned to Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h, whose character and spirituality were unsurpassed. Browne was sympathetic to Azal\u2019s claims but was also impressed by the spirituality of the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed community. The followers of Azal (sometimes spelled Ezel) were known as Azal\u00eds.<br><br>While Browne\u2019s sympathetic views on Azal were misguided, he made a great contribution to Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed studies through his translations of historical works and his accounts of the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed community. Amongst Persians, at a time when nearly the whole nation was highly suspicious of foreigners, and in particular of any British or Russian person due to the political dynamics of that time, Edward Browne was well accepted by the people who knew him and his works. He is well remembered today, and a street named after him in Tehran, as well as his statue, remained even after the Iranian revolution in 1979.<br><br>(Summary by Nicholas James Bridgewater)", "duration": 104922, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "861", "name": "Edward Granville Browne"}], "coverArt": "http://www.archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt8/Year_Amongst_the_Persians_1102.jpg", "copyright_year": "1893", "genres": ["Travel & Geography", "Other religions"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Nicholas James Bridgewater"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Leni"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "mim@can (1949-2017)"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "00 -
