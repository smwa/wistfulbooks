{"title": "Wonder-Working Magician", "description": "\"The Wonderful Magician\" is perhaps better known to poetical students in England from the spirited fragment Shelley has left us in his \"Scenes from Calderon.\" The preoccupation of a subject by a great master throws immense difficulties in the way of any one who ventures to follow in the same path: but as Shelley allowed himself great licence in his versification, and either from carelessness or an imperfect knowledge of Spanish is occasionally unfaithful to the meaning of his author, it may be hoped in my own version that strict fidelity both as to the form as well as substance of the original may be some compensation for the absence of those higher poetical harmonies to which many of my readers will have been accustomed.  - Summary by The Translator\n<BR><BR>Cast list:<BR>\nCyprian: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/13577\">Adrian Stephens</a><br>\nThe Demon: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/6754\">ToddHW</a><br>\nLelius, The Governor of Antioch's Son: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/8677\">KHand</a><br>\nFlorus, friend of Lelius: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/13830\">Adam Bielka</a><br>\nMoscon, Servant of Cyprian: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/7170\">alanmapstone</a><br>\nClarin, Servant of Cyprian: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/10789\">Tomas Peter</a><br>\nThe Governor of Antioch: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/4705\">Algy Pug</a><br>\nFabius, his Servant: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/3618\">Timothy Ferguson</a><br>\nLysander, the reputed Father of Justina: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/8425\">Larry Wilson</a><br>\nJustina: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/13990\">Jeanne Viray</a><br>\nLivia, her Maid: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/11790\">TJ Burns</a><br>\nA Servant: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/11305\">Craig Franklin</a><br>\nA Soldier, Chorus, People, Voice Within: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/8072\">Kimberly Krause</a><br>\nVoice: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/11535\">Nemo</a><br>\nChorus of Voices: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/7170\">alanmapstone</a><br>\nA Phantom Figure of Justina: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/11417\">Eva Davis</a><br>\nThe Skeleton: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/10614\">Leanne Yau</a><br>\nStage Directions: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/10179\">Sonia</a><br>\nEditing: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/6754\">ToddHW</a>\n", "duration": 9239, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "5858", "name": " Pedro Calder\u00f3n de la Barca"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/wonderworkingmagician_2004_librivox/wonder_magician.jpg", "copyright_year": "1873", "genres": ["Plays"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "ToddHW"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "ToddHW"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Sonia"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Act 1", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/wonderworkingmagician_2004_librivox/wonderworkingmagician_1_calderon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2837}, {"section": 2, "title": "Act 2", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/wonderworkingmagician_2004_librivox/wonderworkingmagician_2_calderon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3094}, {"section": 3, "title": "Act 3", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/wonderworkingmagician_2004_librivox/wonderworkingmagician_3_calderon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3308}]}
