{"title": "Kibun Daizin; or, From Shark-Boy to Merchant Prince", "description": "This is the story of a brave, skillful and ambitious boy who sets out to become the wealthiest man of Japan. He succeeds in doing just that because of his virtuous deeds. A real person, Kinokuniya Bunzaemon (1669 \u2013 1734), was the inspiration for this fictionalized biography by Gensai Murai. An English translation of the tale originally appeared in the once popular St. Nicholas Magazine (1873 - 1940) for children that featured stories by eminent as well as promising young authors, some of whom (Edna St. Vincent Millay, F. Scott Fitzgerald, E. B. White, and Stephen Vincent Ben\u00e9t) were first published in it, receiving cash awards as St. Nicholas League prize winners.  - Summary by Brian Fullen", "duration": 9191, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "17743", "name": "Gensai Murai"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/kibun_daizin_2309_librivox/kibun_daizin_2309.jpg", "copyright_year": "1904", "genres": ["Fictional Biographies & Memoirs"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Brian Fullen"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "TriciaG"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Gillian Hendrie"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "An Ambitious Boy", "readers": [17713], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/kibun_daizin_2309_librivox/kibundaizin_01_murai_64kb.mp3", "duration": 990}, {"section": 2, "title": "Bunkichi Plans To Kill The Shark", "readers": [17713], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/kibun_daizin_2309_librivox/kibundaizin_02_murai_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1015}, {"section": 3, "title": "A Boat Capsized \u2014 A Hairbreadth Escape", "readers": [17713], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/kibun_daizin_2309_librivox/kibundaizin_03_murai_64kb.mp3", "duration": 969}, {"section": 4, "title": "The Tables Turned", "readers": [17713], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/kibun_daizin_2309_librivox/kibundaizin_04_murai_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1055}, {"section": 5, "title": "The Battle Of Stone Missiles\u2014The Monkeys\u2019 Panic", "readers": [17713], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/kibun_daizin_2309_librivox/kibundaizin_05_murai_64kb.mp3", "duration": 716}, {"section": 6, "title": "The Great Hazard \u2014 A Perilous Voyage", "readers": [17713], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/kibun_daizin_2309_librivox/kibundaizin_06_murai_64kb.mp3", "duration": 794}, {"section": 7, "title": "The Sea-Giant Appears", "readers": [17713], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/kibun_daizin_2309_librivox/kibundaizin_07_murai_64kb.mp3", "duration": 795}, {"section": 8, "title": "An Eccentric Fellow", "readers": [17713], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/kibun_daizin_2309_librivox/kibundaizin_08_murai_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1089}, {"section": 9, "title": "The Great Conflagration \u2014 The Charity \u201cBento\u201d", "readers": [18006], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/kibun_daizin_2309_librivox/kibundaizin_09_murai_64kb.mp3", "duration": 901}, {"section": 10, "title": "Ambition Satisfied \u2014 The Merchant Prince", "readers": [17713], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/kibun_daizin_2309_librivox/kibundaizin_10_murai_64kb.mp3", "duration": 867}]}
