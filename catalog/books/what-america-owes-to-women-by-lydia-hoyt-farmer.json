{"title": "What America Owes to Women", "description": "As American women have been imperfectly represented in the world, it is our aim in this volume to give a pen protrait of the American Woman Past and Present; not in the way of boastful assertions, nor by pleading for her rights which have already been awarded her; but by statements of her achievements in the lines of literature, philanthropy, church work, education, science, industry, medicine, business, art, music, invention, home life, domestic science, etc., that hereby the subtle, yet powerful influence of woman in the development of this great country may be manifested and strengthened. Thus there shall be constructed a fitting memorial of the American Woman of the Past, and inspiring model for the American Woman of the Future. \r\nWe have endeavored to make this book a valuable Souvenir of the Columbian Exposition. \r\nThese portraits have been sketched by many pens, for no one writer could have accomplished the object desired.\r\n - Summary by Excerpt from Preface", "duration": 70519, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "18059", "name": "Lydia Hoyt Farmer"}], "coverArt": null, "copyright_year": "1893", "genres": ["*Non-fiction", "History", "Modern (19th C)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Christine Rottger"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Christine Rottger"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Christine Rottger"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Dedication, Preface and Introduction", "readers": [16209], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/whatamericaowestowomen_2509_librivox/whatamericaowestowoman_00_farmer_64kb.mp3", "duration": 597}, {"section": 1, "title": "Some Women in America History: What America owes to Isabella of Castile and to Madame LaFayette by Lydia Hoyt Farmer", "readers": [19914], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/whatamericaowestowomen_2509_librivox/whatamericaowestowoman_01_farmer_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1748}, {"section": 2, "title": "Columbus at Santa Fe by Virginia P.
