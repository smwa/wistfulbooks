{"title": "Guide to the Lakes", "description": "In the late eighteenth century, English writers discovered the landscape, not only in the paintings of Claude Lorrain, Nicolas Poussin and Salvator Rosa, but also as a place to be visited and viewed as if it were a picture. No part of England was more discovered in this period than the Lake District, which was transformed over the course of the next century from a remote region of farmland and inaccessible hills into a wild and romantic landscape of picturesque lake and mountain, described in works such as Thomas West\u2019s A guide to the Lakes (1778). West\u2019s predecessors \u2013 Thomas Gray, Arthur Young, Thomas Pennant and William Hutchinson \u2013had merely passed through the Lakes. West, a resident of the Lakes, took the reader on a tour of the district as a whole, visiting all the lakes, with the sole exception of Wastwater. A devotee of the Claude glass \u2013 a convex, tinted mirror in which the landscape appears as it might in a painting by Lorrain \u2013 West follows and improves upon Gray\u2019s technique of identifying \u2018stations\u2019 from which the landscape would appear at its most picturesque. West\u2019s guide remains something of a hybrid, however, with its lengthy antiquarian descriptions of the surrounding towns of Lancaster, Penrith and Kendal. - Summary by Phil Benson", "duration": 15295, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "14678", "name": "Thomas West"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/librivoxcdcoverart36/guide_lakes_2001.jpg", "copyright_year": "1778", "genres": ["Travel & Geography"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Phil Benson"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Phil Benson"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Annise"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Newgatenovelist"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Introduction", "readers": [6097], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/guide_lakes_2001_librivox/guide_lakes_01_west_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1122}, {"section": 2, "title": "Lancaster", "readers": [6097], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/guide_lakes_2001_librivox/guide_lakes_02_west_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2538}, {"section": 3, "title": "Coniston", "readers": [6097], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/guide_lakes_2001_librivox/guide_lakes_03_west_64kb.mp3", "duration": 802}, {"section": 4, "title": "Windermere", "readers": [6097], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/guide_lakes_2001_librivox/guide_lakes_04_west_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1393}, {"section": 5, "title": "Ambleside", "readers": [6097], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/guide_lakes_2001_librivox/guide_lakes_05_west_64kb.mp3", "duration": 831}, {"section": 6, "title": "Keswick", "readers": [6097], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/guide_lakes_2001_librivox/guide_lakes_06_west_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2469}, {"section": 7, "title": "Bassenthwaite Water", "readers": [6097], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/guide_lakes_2001_librivox/guide_lakes_07_west_64kb.mp3", "duration": 864}, {"section": 8, "title": "Buttermere, &c.", "readers": [6097], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/guide_lakes_2001_librivox/guide_lakes_08_west_64kb.mp3", "duration": 739}, {"section": 9, "title": "Lowes Water", "readers": [6097], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/guide_lakes_2001_librivox/guide_lakes_09_west_64kb.mp3", "duration": 989}, {"section": 10, "title": "Ullswater", "readers": [6097], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/guide_lakes_2001_librivox/guide_lakes_10_west_64kb.mp3", "duration": 932}, {"section": 11, "title": "Hawes Water", "readers": [6097], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/guide_lakes_2001_librivox/guide_lakes_11_west_64kb.mp3", "duration": 396}, {"section": 12, "title": "Penrith", "readers": [6097], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/guide_lakes_2001_librivox/guide_lakes_12_west_64kb.mp3", "duration": 802}, {"section": 13, "title": "Kendal", "readers": [6097], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/guide_lakes_2001_librivox/guide_lakes_13_west_64kb.mp3", "duration": 949}, {"section": 14, "title": "Addenda", "readers": [6097], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/guide_lakes_2001_librivox/guide_lakes_14_west_64kb.mp3", "duration": 469}]}
