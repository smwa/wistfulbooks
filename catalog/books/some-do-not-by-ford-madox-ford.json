{"title": "Some Do Not...", "description": "Set immediately before and during the Great War, Some Do Not... is a tale of social cruelty among the English upper classes that pits real honour against shameless duplicity and subjects its principal characters to extremes of mental suffering that appear to be analogous to the (never directly described) physical horrors of the actual fighting. The plot revolves around the mores and desires of the intellectually brilliant but impossibly high-minded Christopher Tietjens, his icy wife Sylvia, and Valentine Wannop, a poor but well-educated young woman who loves Christopher, and is in many ways his moral and intellectual equal. In its time, the novel was unusual for its daring, often disorienting, use of flashbacks within scenes, for its scrambling together of interior and spoken dialog, and for the demand it places on the reader to interpret what is \"really\" taking place on the basis of slender and widely dispersed clues. As Julian Barnes has written \"It will be a very rare reader who does not intermittently look up from the page to ask, \u2018But did I know that? Have we been told that already or not?\u2019 \" Notwithstanding these difficulties, Malcolm Bradbury has described Parade's End, the tetralogy of which Some Do Not... forms the first part, as being, in toto, \"the greatest modern war novel from a British writer\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the text sometimes mentions persons' names out of context, the following list of characters is included to help the listener keep track of who is who:<br>\r\nChristopher Tietjens: intellectually brilliant youngest son of a wealthy landowner.<br>\r\nSylvia Tietjens, n\u00e9e Sattherthwaite: Christopher Tietjens' wife.<br>\r\nMrs Satterthwaite: Sylvia Tietjens' mother.<br>\r\nFather Consett: an Irish priest, friend of the Satterthwaites.<br>\r\nVincent Macmaster: a colleague and friend of Christopher Tietjens.<br>\r\nGeneral Campion: an old friend of Christopher Tietjens' father.<br>\r\nLady Claudine Sandbach: sister of General Campion.
