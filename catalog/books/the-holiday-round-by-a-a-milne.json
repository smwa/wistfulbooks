{"title": "Holiday Round", "description": "Alan Alexander Milne, popularly known as A. A. Milne, is best known \u2013 perhaps to most people only known \u2013 for his children\u2019s book, Winnie the Pooh. Yet he was an incredibly prolific author. He published dozens of successful plays, myriad humorous articles written for internationally prominent journals, a wide range of social, political, and other nonfiction works, and even a murder mystery.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThis collection is humorous throughout, but humorous in a particularly Milnesque way: he consciously and quite openly rejected the bitterness of satire in favor of a peculiarly gentle, often self-deprecating humor. Included here are dozens of short essays showing, among other things, Milne\u2019s extraordinary capacity to understand \u2013 and be understood by \u2013 children, and his special affinity for women, as friends and as lovers. - Summary by Kirsten Wever", "duration": 29821, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "1259", "name": "A.
