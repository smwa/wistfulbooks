{"title": "Raymond Lull: First Missionary to the Moslems", "description": "With his vast knowledge in a wide range of subjects, Raymond Lull was a Renaissance man before the time of the Renaissance. After encountering the living Christ, he desired to serve Him for the rest of his life. While the rest of the world sought to drive Muslims from the Holy Land by crusades with the sword, Lull waged his own personal crusade of love and logic to win Muslims to the gospel. As he advocated for schooling in oriental languages, undertook missionary journeys to North Africa, and eventually died a martyr's death, Raymond Lull made this his motto: he who loves not lives not; he who lives by the Life can not die.
