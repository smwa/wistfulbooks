{"title": "Crowd: A Study of the Popular Mind", "description": "\"Civilisations as yet have only been created and directed by a small intellectual aristocracy, never by crowds. Crowds are only powerful for destruction. Their rule is always tantamount to a barbarian phase. A civilisation involves fixed rules, discipline, a passing from the instinctive to the rational state, forethought for the future, an elevated degree of culture \u2014 all of them conditions that crowds, left to themselves, have invariably shown themselves incapable of realising. In consequence of the purely destructive nature of their power crowds act like those microbes which hasten the dissolution of enfeebled or dead bodies. When the structure of a civilisation is rotten, it is always the masses that bring about its downfall.\" - Gustave Le Bon, from Introduction", "duration": 21124, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "11790", "name": "Gustave Le Bon"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt13/thecrowd_1602.jpg", "copyright_year": "0", "genres": ["Psychology", "Social Science (Culture & Anthropology)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Oxenhandler"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Oxenhandler"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Annise"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "DaveC"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Preface, The Crowd: A Study of the Popular Mind", "readers": [7822], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/crowd_1602_librivox/crowd_00_lebon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 512}, {"section": 1, "title": "Introduction, The Era of Crowds", "readers": [7822], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/crowd_1602_librivox/crowd_01_lebon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 964}, {"section": 2, "title": "General Characteristics of Crowds\u2014 Psychological Law of Their Mental Unity", "readers": [7822], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/crowd_1602_librivox/crowd_02_lebon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1225}, {"section": 3, "title": "The Sentiments and Morality of Crowds", "readers": [7822], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/crowd_1602_librivox/crowd_03_lebon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2685}, {"section": 4, "title": "The Ideas, Reasoning Power and Imagination of Crowds", "readers": [7822], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/crowd_1602_librivox/crowd_04_lebon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1218}, {"section": 5, "title": "A Religious Shape Assumed by all the Convictions of Crowds", "readers": [7822], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/crowd_1602_librivox/crowd_05_lebon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 672}, {"section": 6, "title": "Remote Factors of the Opinions and Beliefs of Crowds", "readers": [7822], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/crowd_1602_librivox/crowd_06_lebon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2475}, {"section": 7, "title": "The Immediate Factors of the Opinions of Crowds", "readers": [7822], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/crowd_1602_librivox/crowd_07_lebon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1667}, {"section": 8, "title": "The Leaders of Crowds and their Means of Persuasion", "readers": [7822], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/crowd_1602_librivox/crowd_08_lebon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2555}, {"section": 9, "title": "Limitations of the Variability of the Beliefs and Opinions of Crowds", "readers": [7822], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/crowd_1602_librivox/crowd_09_lebon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1439}, {"section": 10, "title": "The Classification of Crowds", "readers": [7822], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/crowd_1602_librivox/crowd_10_lebon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 466}, {"section": 11, "title": "Crowds Termed Criminal Crowds", "readers": [7822], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/crowd_1602_librivox/crowd_11_lebon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 552}, {"section": 12, "title": "Criminal Juries", "readers": [7822], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/crowd_1602_librivox/crowd_12_lebon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 960}, {"section": 13, "title": "Electoral Crowds", "readers": [7822], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/crowd_1602_librivox/crowd_13_lebon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1162}, {"section": 14, "title": "Parliamentary Assemblies", "readers": [7822], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/crowd_1602_librivox/crowd_14_lebon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2572}]}
