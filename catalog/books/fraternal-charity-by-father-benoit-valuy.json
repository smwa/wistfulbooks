{"title": "Fraternal Charity", "description": "This short treatise comes from a work by the Roman Catholic priest Father Valuy, S.J., and bears an imprimatur. It was written for members of religious orders; yet, as the translator notes, it may be of interest to others, for \"love, the sunshine of existence, is wanted everywhere.\" The first five chapters cover the fundamentals of fraternal charity. Chapters 6 through 17 discuss twelve characteristics of fraternal charity. Chapters 18 and 19 show how God manifests the virtue of charity to us most perfectly. Chapters 20 through 30 list eleven ways to preserve charity in a community. Chapters 31 and 32 give advice on how to persevere in charity under difficult circumstances. The appendix includes a few points from the pen of Father Faber on the practice of fraternal charity and a list of the exemplary characteristics of religious members who manifest this important virtue.
