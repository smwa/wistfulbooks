His novels about boys who succeed under the tutelage of older mentors were hugely popular in their day.  This book, a true rags-to-riches novel, follows Grant, the oldest of three children that their mother, a widow is struggling to feed and clothe.  His determination to succeed is fierce and yet he never cheats or follows the easy path to success.   - Summary by Phil Chenevert", "duration": 18686, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "27", "name": "Horatio Alger, Jr."}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/helpinghimself_1410_librivox/helping_himself_or_grant_thorntons_ambition_1410.jpg", "copyright_year": "1886", "genres": ["General"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "pattymarie"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "THE MINISTER'S SON", "readers": [9393], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/helpinghimself_1410_librivox/helpinghimself_01_alger_64kb.mp3", "duration": 502}, {"section": 2, "title": "GRANT MAKES TWO BUSINESS CALLS", "readers": [9393], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/helpinghimself_1410_librivox/helpinghimself_02_alger_64kb.mp3", "duration": 515}, {"section": 3, "title": "GRANT WALKS TO SOMERSET", "readers": [9302], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/helpinghimself_1410_librivox/helpinghimself_03_alger_64kb.mp3", "duration": 578}, {"section": 4, "title": "A TIMELY RESCUE", "readers": [9087], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/helpinghimself_1410_librivox/helpinghimself_04_alger_64kb.mp3", "duration": 475}, {"section": 5, "title": "MRS.
