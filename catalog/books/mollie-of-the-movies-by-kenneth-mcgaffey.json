{"title": "Mollie of the Movies", "description": "This is a story of a girl who tries to make it big in the world of show business. McGaffey gives us the heroine's first-person account. He writes in an epistolary style and gives us a comic, slice-of-life look at a girl's attempts to become a film star. This was serialized in Photoplay Magazine, the premier fan magazine of the 1910s and 20s. Photoplay would go on to publish a wide array of fiction about the film industry. This was one of their first concerted efforts to create a long-form narrative about Hollywood.
