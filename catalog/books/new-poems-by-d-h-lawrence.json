{"title": "New Poems", "description": "This is an exceptional collection of superb and introspectively distinct poems from the pen of master author D. H. Lawrence. Never failing to both delight and amaze, Lawrence's poems exhibit an insight that elevates them to a level of splendid uniqueness. These are poems that come from the heart and mind of one who has watched the unspeakable destruction of war wreak havoc across Europe, one who has witnessed the devastation inflicted on his country by an immense power that must be overcome and defeated. This is a also a poet who knows that despite unimaginable privation, everyday life must and will continue, and everyday psychological trauma must and will continue - and as such both must and will be eternally etched by the poet in the literary record. <br><br>\r\n\r\nThese are poems of the present, of facets of human existence in all its diversity, of aspects of life revealed with an intensity fitting their urgency. The urgency and resilience of life - the determination to persevere in the face of adversity - ebbs and flows through these superb poems like the narrative of a river whose, \"invisible tide / Threads and thrills like ore that is wealth to the eye.\" And yet this pseudo-sentient river, this \"pouring measure / Of death-producing wine,\" solemnly comes with the poetic assurance of salvation, of elegiac deliverance, and with the promise, \"By heaven and earth and hellish stream / To break this sick and nauseous dream / We writhe and lust in, both.\"\r\n <br><br>\r\nIndeed, if a dream it is in which we \"writhe and lust,\" if \"souls of the dead / In stupor persist at the gates of life,\" it is a dream fully understood and clearly elucidated by this poet, this seer, this literary master.  <br>\r\n - Summary by Bruce Kachuk<br>", "duration": 4593, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "34", "name": "D.
