{"title": "Marriage of Heaven and Hell (version 2)", "description": "\"The road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom.\"<br><br>The Marriage of Heaven & Hell is William Blake\u2019s masterpiece \u2013 a piously blasphemous reimagining of the duality of good and evil as an eternal dance of equally essential polarities.<br><br>Good, in Blake\u2019s complex cosmology, is defined by a blind deference to the external, rational order embodied by the tyrant and the priest. Evil is the chaotic and revolutionary impulse that defies all reason and authority.<br><br>While Blake\u2019s sympathies are clearly with the Romantic revolutionary, he argues for the necessity of both sides, which create balance through their eternal opposition.
