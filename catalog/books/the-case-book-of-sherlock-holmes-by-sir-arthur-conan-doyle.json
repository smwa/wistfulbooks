{"title": "Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes", "description": "This final volume of detective stories was Doyle\u2019s effort to put his most famous creation behind him at long last. It includes a variety of tales, from widely separated periods in the protagonist\u2019s life, including his retirement, stories told from various points of view: Watson\u2019s, Holmes\u2019s, and an omniscient narrator\u2019s. Most, of course, illustrate the detective\u2019s famous \u201cdeduction,\u201d but not all; some of his successes call upon resources of character which we rarely associate with him. He demonstrates compassion and empathy, and more than once he laughs. His attitude toward Dr. Watson, although occasionally brusque, includes kindness, affection, and professional respect, revealing a deep and complex friendship that endears both men to the reader. (Summary by T. A. Copeland).
