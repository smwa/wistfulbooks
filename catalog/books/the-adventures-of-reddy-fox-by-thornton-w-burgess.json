In this story, Reddy and Granny Fox must outsmart Farmer Brown\u2019s Boy who is out to get Reddy for stealing his pet chicken. Along the way, Reddy encounters many of the citizens of the Green Meadows and the Green Forest and with him we learn little lessons about life such as: the perils of being a show off; the importance of using all of one\u2019s senses; that it is a fine thing to show sympathy and kindness to others \u2013 even our enemies; and that the value of a grandmother\u2019s wisdom is inestimable.<br /><br />We also learn that after you\u2019ve stolen a boy\u2019s pet chicken and he is coming your way with a gun, a shovel and a hound dog, it may be time to beat a hasty retreat.<br />(Summary by John Lieder)<br /><br /><a href=\"http://librivox.org/reader/2987\">AaronW</a> is a guest reader in Section 6.", "duration": 5901, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "282", "name": "Thornton W.
