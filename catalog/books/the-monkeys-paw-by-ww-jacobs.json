{"title": "Monkey's Paw", "description": "    The Monkey\u2019s Paw was written in 1902 by W.W. Jacobs. It\u2019s a dark brooding tale which promises from the start that the light you see at the end of the tunnel is actually an oncoming train. Mr and Mrs White of Laburnum Villas step out toward that light by taking up the three wishes granted to the owner of the Monkey\u2019s Paw. Terrible things have happened to previous owners of this artifact but surely the Whites will fare better than those who have gone before\u2026\n\n    (Summary by Jim Mowatt.)\n", "duration": 1529, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "924", "name": "W.
