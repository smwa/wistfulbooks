{"title": "Ghost Stories of an Antiquary", "description": "Montague Rhodes James (1862-1936) was a medieval scholar; Provost of King\u2019s College, Cambridge. He wrote many of his ghost stories to be read aloud in the long tradition of spooky Christmas Eve tales. His stories often use rural settings, with a quiet, scholarly protagonist getting caught up in the activities of supernatural forces. The details of horror are almost never explicit, the stories relying on a gentle, bucolic background to emphasise the awfulness of the otherworldly intrusions.<br /><br />\u201cGhost Stories of an Antiquary\u201d was written as two collections, presented here as two volumes in a single work. There is a short author\u2019s preface before the first story in each volume. (Summary by Peter Yearsley)", "duration": 36399, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "2959", "name": "M. R.
