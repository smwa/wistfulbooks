{"title": "Psalm Of Life", "description": "LibriVox volunteers bring you 22 recordings of A Psalm Of Life by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.<br>\nThis was the Fortnightly Poetry project for February 3, 2019.    <br> ------<br>\nThis poem was first published in the October 1838 issue of The Knickerbocker, a New York City magazine. It then appeared in Longfellow's first published book of poems, Voices Of The Night, in 1839. It is an upbeat psalmists answer to the biblical psalm that we are but dust heading for the grave, urging us instead to be heroic, to make the most of our lives, and set a good example for others to follow.
