{"title": "Thing in the Woods", "description": "Dr. Haverill is asked to fill in as local physician for the skittish Dr. Lennox in a small Pennsylvania town. The locals seem to be a superstitious bunch, prone to fearing traveling in the woods at night and with good reason. It seems a series of vicious attacks have occurred by what appears to be some kind of large animal. As the bodies begin to pile up, Dr. Haverill starts to question whether the responsible party could be something beyond humanity.<br><br>\r\nWriter Margery Williams Bianco (writing here under the pseudonym Harper Williams) is perhaps better known for writing the children's classic \"The Velveteen Rabbit\", but this dark slice of mystery horror fiction was found to be admired by none other than H. P. Lovecraft. Lovecraft scholars have noted in particular a distinct influence that this book had on his famous story \"The Dunwich Horror\".<br><br>\r\nAlso please note that this book is of its time and features racially insensitive language in the early chapters. Those who are concerned with such language should be advised.
