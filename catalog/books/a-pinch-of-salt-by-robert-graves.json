{"title": "Pinch of Salt", "description": "    LibriVox volunteers bring you 19 different recordings of A Pinch of Salt by Robert Graves.  This was the weekly poetry project for the week of June 3rd, 2007.<br /><br />\n\n    Perhaps now best known as the author whose book of the same name inspired the Masterpiece Theater series I, Claudius, Robert Graves wrote prolifically throughout his 90 years, concentrating on myth in a scholarly vein. Many of his works were academically controversial. And yet, first and foremost, he considered himself a poet. This poem, which first appeared in 1920, shows Graves to be not only a careful and cautious man, but also exceedingly passionate (Summary by Alan Davis-Drake).", "duration": 1420, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "1178", "name": "Robert Graves"}], "coverArt": "https://www.archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt4/Pinch_Salt_1109.jpg", "copyright_year": "1920", "genres": ["Poetry", "Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Alan Davis Drake (1945-2010)"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Karen Savage"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "A Pinch of Salt read by Alan Davis-Drake", "readers": [254], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/pinch_salt/pinch_of_salt_graves_add_64kb.mp3", "duration": 88}, {"section": 2, "title": "A Pinch of Salt read by Anastasia Lugo", "readers": [1539], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/pinch_salt/pinch_of_salt_graves_al_64kb.mp3", "duration": 68}, {"section": 3, "title": "A Pinch of Salt read by Ellen Tillson", "readers": [1546], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/pinch_salt/pinch_of_salt_graves_et_64kb.mp3", "duration": 81}, {"section": 4, "title": "A Pinch of Salt read by Ezwa", "readers": [123], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/pinch_salt/pinch_of_salt_graves_ezwa_64kb.mp3", "duration": 67}, {"section": 5, "title": "A Pinch of Salt read by JemmaBlythe", "readers": [77], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/pinch_salt/pinch_of_salt_graves_jb_64kb.mp3", "duration": 68}, {"section": 6, "title": "A Pinch of Salt read by Jc Guan", "readers": [1474], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/pinch_salt/pinch_of_salt_graves_jcg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 74}, {"section": 7, "title": "A Pinch of Salt read by Karen Savage", "readers": [103], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/pinch_salt/pinch_of_salt_graves_krs_64kb.mp3", "duration": 57}, {"section": 8, "title": "A Pinch of Salt read by Lee Ann Howlett", "readers": [1212], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/pinch_salt/pinch_of_salt_graves_lah_64kb.mp3", "duration": 68}, {"section": 9, "title": "A Pinch of Salt read by Lucy Burgoyne", "readers": [681], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/pinch_salt/pinch_of_salt_graves_lb_64kb.mp3", "duration": 78}, {"section": 10, "title": "A Pinch of Salt read by Laila J.
