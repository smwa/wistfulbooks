{"title": "Life in the Sick-room: Essays by an Invalid", "description": "Thinking she would be ill for the rest of her life, Harriet Martineau wrote these partly autobiographical essays about life in the sickroom. Considered ground breaking, it asserted that the sickroom is the sick person's place and not the doctor's. Sick people were able and willing to decide what is best for them. In England and abroad, people declared that \"a sick person cannot write a healthy book\" and that Harriet Martineau was definitely out of her senses. It would be interesting to see how much has changed. - Summary by Stav Nisser and Wikipedia.", "duration": 18941, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "1825", "name": "Harriet Martineau"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/lifeinsickroom_1805_librivox/life_sick_room_1805.jpg", "copyright_year": "1844", "genres": ["Essays & Short Works"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Stav Nisser"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Rapunzelina"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "DrPGould"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Essay 1", "readers": [3645], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/lifeinsickroom_1805_librivox/lifeinthesickroom_01_martineau_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1315}, {"section": 2, "title": "Essay 2", "readers": [10801], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/lifeinsickroom_1805_librivox/lifeinthesickroom_02_martineau_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2523}, {"section": 3, "title": "Essay 3", "readers": [10801], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/lifeinsickroom_1805_librivox/lifeinthesickroom_03_martineau_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1858}, {"section": 4, "title": "Essay 4", "readers": [12373], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/lifeinsickroom_1805_librivox/lifeinthesickroom_04_martineau_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2908}, {"section": 5, "title": "Essay 5", "readers": [11084], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/lifeinsickroom_1805_librivox/lifeinthesickroom_05_martineau_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1653}, {"section": 6, "title": "Essay 6", "readers": [10054], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/lifeinsickroom_1805_librivox/lifeinthesickroom_06_martineau_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2096}, {"section": 7, "title": "Essay 7", "readers": [10054], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/lifeinsickroom_1805_librivox/lifeinthesickroom_07_martineau_64kb.mp3", "duration": 894}, {"section": 8, "title": "Essay 8", "readers": [6670], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/lifeinsickroom_1805_librivox/lifeinthesickroom_08_martineau_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1853}, {"section": 9, "title": "Essay 9", "readers": [12293], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/lifeinsickroom_1805_librivox/lifeinthesickroom_09_martineau_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1643}, {"section": 10, "title": "Essay 10", "readers": [10801], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/lifeinsickroom_1805_librivox/lifeinthesickroom_10_martineau_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2198}]}
