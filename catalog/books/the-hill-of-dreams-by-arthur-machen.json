{"title": "Hill of Dreams", "description": "The novel recounts the life of a young man, Lucian Taylor, focusing on his dreamy childhood in rural Wales, in a town based on Caerleon. The Hill of Dreams of the title is an old Roman fort where Lucian has strange sensual visions, including ones of the town in the time of Roman Britain. Later it describes Lucian's attempts to make a living as an author in London, enduring poverty and suffering in the pursuit of art. Generally thought to be Machen's greatest work, it was little noticed on its publication in 1907 save in a glowing review by Alfred Douglas. It was actually written between 1895 and 1897 and has elements of the style of the decadent and aesthetic movement of the period, seen through Machen's own mystical preoccupations. - Summary by Wikipedia", "duration": 25561, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "2155", "name": "Arthur Machen"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/hill_of_dreams_1309_librivox/hill_of_dreams_0913.jpg", "copyright_year": "1907", "genres": ["Horror & Supernatural Fiction"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Mark Nelson"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Mark Nelson"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Ann Boulais"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Libby Gohn"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Chapter 1", "readers": [251], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/hill_of_dreams_1309_librivox/hillofdreams_1_machen_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3847}, {"section": 2, "title": "Chapter 2", "readers": [251], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/hill_of_dreams_1309_librivox/hillofdreams_2_machen_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3111}, {"section": 3, "title": "Chapter 3", "readers": [251], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/hill_of_dreams_1309_librivox/hillofdreams_3_machen_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3640}, {"section": 4, "title": "Chapter 4", "readers": [251], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/hill_of_dreams_1309_librivox/hillofdreams_4_machen_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3158}, {"section": 5, "title": "Chapter 5", "readers": [251], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/hill_of_dreams_1309_librivox/hillofdreams_5_machen_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3026}, {"section": 6, "title": "Chapter 6", "readers": [251], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/hill_of_dreams_1309_librivox/hillofdreams_6_machen_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3769}, {"section": 7, "title": "Chapter 7 Part 1", "readers": [251], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/hill_of_dreams_1309_librivox/hillofdreams_7_machen_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3211}, {"section": 8, "title": "Chapter 7 Part 2", "readers": [251], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/hill_of_dreams_1309_librivox/hillofdreams_8_machen_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1799}]}
