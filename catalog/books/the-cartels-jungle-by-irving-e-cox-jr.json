{"title": "Cartels Jungle", "description": "In most ideally conceived Utopias the world as it exists is depicted as a mushrooming horror of maladjustment, cruelty and crime.

Cox has a great deal more than a storyteller's magic to impart.", "duration": 6012, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "649", "name": "Irving E.
