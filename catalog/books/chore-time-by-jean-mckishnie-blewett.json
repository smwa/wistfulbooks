She used the pseudonym Katherine Kent for some of her writing.<br>\n\nAfter her death, fellow female journalist Bride Broder wrote in tribute:\n\"There is a simplicity about Mrs. Blewett's prose and verse that has made a wide appeal, and her gay-hearted attitude to life, the humorous twists she gave to little things, made her very welcome as a speaker at women's gatherings. In all her writings she touched on the things that appeal to women everywhere and, in doing so, won the admiration of men readers also.\" (Wikipedia)", "duration": 1430, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "9964", "name": "Jean McKishnie Blewett"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/chore_time_1602.poem_librivox/choretime_1602.jpg", "copyright_year": "1906", "genres": ["Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Chore Time - Read BK", "readers": [8786], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/chore_time_1602.poem_librivox/choretime_blewett_bk_64kb.mp3", "duration": 177}, {"section": 2, "title": "Chore Time - Read BSD", "readers": [10402], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/chore_time_1602.poem_librivox/choretime_blewett_bsd_64kb.mp3", "duration": 166}, {"section": 3, "title": "Chore Time - Read DL", "readers": [2911], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/chore_time_1602.poem_librivox/choretime_blewett_dl_64kb.mp3", "duration": 174}, {"section": 4, "title": "Chore Time - Read EL", "readers": [9872], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/chore_time_1602.poem_librivox/choretime_blewett_el_64kb.mp3", "duration": 167}, {"section": 5, "title": "Chore Time - Read GF", "readers": [10573], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/chore_time_1602.poem_librivox/choretime_blewett_gf_64kb.mp3", "duration": 202}, {"section": 6, "title": "Chore Time - Read GG", "readers": [8011], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/chore_time_1602.poem_librivox/choretime_blewett_gg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 177}, {"section": 7, "title": "Chore Time - Read LLW", "readers": [4738], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/chore_time_1602.poem_librivox/choretime_blewett_llw_64kb.mp3", "duration": 184}, {"section": 8, "title": "Chore Time - Read MK", "readers": [8051], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/chore_time_1602.poem_librivox/choretime_blewett_mk_64kb.mp3", "duration": 183}]}
