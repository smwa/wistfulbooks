{"title": "Sword Maker", "description": "Times are hard in Frankfort. Defeat in war, weak leadership, trade blockades and a starving population lead to a restive and unhappy citizenry. The one thing Frankfort does have is the best three sword-makers in the country, who form a guild to try and find solutions to the economic problems assailing the city. One day, a stranger appears: an instructor in swordsmanship and the craft of sword-making.  Despite not being licensed to carry a sword in the city, he promises the guild he can help them make their fortunes and lead the city out of the recession. - Summary by Lynne Thompson", "duration": 42290, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "811", "name": "Robert Barr"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/sword_maker_1907_librivox/swordmaker_1907.jpg", "copyright_year": "1910", "genres": ["Published 1900 onward"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Lynne T"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Lynne T"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Helen Z.
