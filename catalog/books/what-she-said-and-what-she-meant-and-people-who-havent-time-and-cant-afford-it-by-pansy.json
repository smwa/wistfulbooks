{"title": "What She Said and What She Meant, and People Who Haven't Time and Can't Afford It", "description": "Two short stories by Pansy. In \"What She Said and What She Meant,\" Mrs. Marks detests gossip and avoids it as much as she can. But what she <i>does</i> say is vague and suggestive. It is taken, added to, and passed on by others, so that it is no longer what she <i>meant</i>, and threatens to ruin people's reputations and lives in the process. In \"People Who Haven't Time and Can't Afford It,\" Mrs. Leymon is awakened to the needs of the abject poor in her town and works out how to help them. But will she find anyone able and willing to give of their time and money to help her with the scheme?
