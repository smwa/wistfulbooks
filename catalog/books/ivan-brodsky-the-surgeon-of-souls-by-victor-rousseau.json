{"title": "Ivan Brodsky, The Surgeon of Souls", "description": "Dr. Ivan Brodsky more than merely a traditional doctor. Rather than trafficking in the healing of human ailments by means of conventional medical science, Brodsky takes the cases that requires a more psychical solution to heal the human soul itself. Equipped with a vast knowledge of the supernatural, the power of hypnosis and various scientific devices that can bridge the world between the living and the dead, we witness Brodsky, through the eyes of his assistant, set free spiritual manifestations of anger and fear, fend off an animalistic poltergeist, resurrect an ancient Egyptian mummy, prevent murder committed by a wax figure of Admiral Nelson and much more!
