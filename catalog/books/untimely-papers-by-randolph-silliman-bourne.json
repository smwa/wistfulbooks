{"title": "Untimely Papers", "description": "This is a posthumous collection of essays by Randolph Bourne. Many originally appeared in the journal \"The Seven Arts,\" before the controversial end to its run. Also included is the unfinished manuscript of \"The State,\" the book Bourne worked on until his tragic death in December, 1918, at the hands of the Spanish flu pandemic. In the words of the book's editor, poet James Oppenheim, \"We have nothing else like this book in America. It is the only living record of the suppressed minority, and is, as so often the case, the prophecy of that minority's final triumph.\"  - Summary by Ben Adams", "duration": 18351, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "11495", "name": "Randolph Silliman Bourne"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt24/untimely_papers_1607.jpg", "copyright_year": "1919", "genres": ["War & Military", "Essays & Short Works", "Political Science"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Ben Adams"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Ben Adams"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Bev J Stevens"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Larry Wilson"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Editor's Foreward", "readers": [9372], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/untimelypapers_1607_librivox/untimelypapers_00_bourne_64kb.mp3", "duration": 339}, {"section": 1, "title": "Old Tyrannies", "readers": [9372], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/untimelypapers_1607_librivox/untimelypapers_01_bourne_64kb.mp3", "duration": 982}, {"section": 2, "title": "The War and the Intellectuals", "readers": [9372], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/untimelypapers_1607_librivox/untimelypapers_02_bourne_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2072}, {"section": 3, "title": "Below the Battle", "readers": [9372], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/untimelypapers_1607_librivox/untimelypapers_03_bourne_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1274}, {"section": 4, "title": "The Collapse of American Strategy", "readers": [9372], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/untimelypapers_1607_librivox/untimelypapers_04_bourne_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2279}, {"section": 5, "title": "A War Diary", "readers": [9372], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/untimelypapers_1607_librivox/untimelypapers_05_bourne_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2005}, {"section": 6, "title": "Twilight of Idols", "readers": [9372], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/untimelypapers_1607_librivox/untimelypapers_06_bourne_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2204}, {"section": 7, "title": "Unfinished Fragment on The State - Part 1", "readers": [9372], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/untimelypapers_1607_librivox/untimelypapers_07_bourne_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2565}, {"section": 8, "title": "Unfinished Fragment on The State - Part 2", "readers": [9372], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/untimelypapers_1607_librivox/untimelypapers_08_bourne_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2313}, {"section": 9, "title": "Unfinished Fragment on The State - Part 3", "readers": [9372], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/untimelypapers_1607_librivox/untimelypapers_09_bourne_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2318}]}
