{"title": "Blue Island", "description": "Ten years after the Titanic went down, W.T. Stead's daughter Estelle published The Blue Island: Experiences of a New Arrival Beyond the Veil, which purported to be a communication with Stead via a medium. In the book, Stead describes his death at sea and discusses the nature of the afterlife. The manuscript was produced using automatic writing, and Ms. Stead cited as proof of its authenticity the writer's habit of going back to cross \"t's\" and dot \"i's\" while proof-reading, which she said was characteristic of her father's writing technique in life.
