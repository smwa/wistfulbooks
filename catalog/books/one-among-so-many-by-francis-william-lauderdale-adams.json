{"title": "One Among So Many", "description": "Adams' energy and drive can be seen through his large output of written work in his short lifetime. He often wrote quickly and did little revision, living as he did on the proceeds of his own work rather than with the support of a family or sinecure. Songs of the Army of the Night has been reprinted in many editions, but the reputation of these poems ascends from their engagement with social issues, rather than their value as pure poetry for Adams was deeply sympathetic towards downtrodden races and men. - Summary by Wikipedia", "duration": 1760, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "12589", "name": "Francis William Lauderdale Adams"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/one_among_so_many_1703.poem_librivox/oneamongsomany_1703.jpg", "copyright_year": "0", "genres": ["Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "One Among So Many - Read by BK", "readers": [8786], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/one_among_so_many_1703.poem_librivox/somany_adams_bk_64kb.mp3", "duration": 286}, {"section": 2, "title": "One Among So Many - Read by ED", "readers": [11417], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/one_among_so_many_1703.poem_librivox/somany_adams_ed_64kb.mp3", "duration": 221}, {"section": 3, "title": "One Among So Many - Read by EL|ALP", "readers": [4705, 9872], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/one_among_so_many_1703.poem_librivox/somany_adams_el_alp_64kb.mp3", "duration": 211}, {"section": 4, "title": "One Among So Many - Read by GG", "readers": [8011], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/one_among_so_many_1703.poem_librivox/somany_adams_gg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 221}, {"section": 5, "title": "One Among So Many - Read by MK", "readers": [8051], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/one_among_so_many_1703.poem_librivox/somany_adams_mk_64kb.mp3", "duration": 210}, {"section": 6, "title": "One Among So Many - Read by MSD", "readers": [10891], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/one_among_so_many_1703.poem_librivox/somany_adams_msd_64kb.mp3", "duration": 212}, {"section": 7, "title": "One Among So Many - Read by PY", "readers": [167], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/one_among_so_many_1703.poem_librivox/somany_adams_py_64kb.mp3", "duration": 231}, {"section": 8, "title": "One Among So Many - Read by TA", "readers": [10289], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/one_among_so_many_1703.poem_librivox/somany_adams_ta_64kb.mp3", "duration": 168}]}
