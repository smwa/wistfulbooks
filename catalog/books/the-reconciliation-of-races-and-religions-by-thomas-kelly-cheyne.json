{"title": "Reconciliation of Races and Religions", "description": "\u201cThe primary aim of this work is twofold,\u201d writes Thomas K. Cheyne. \u201cIt would fain contribute to the cause of universal peace, and promote the better understanding of the various religions which really are but one religion. The union of religions must necessarily precede the union of races, which at present is so lamentably incomplete\u2026. I have endeavoured to study the various races and religions on their best side, and not to fetter myself to any individual teacher or party, for \u2018out of His fullness have all we received.\u2019 Max M\u00fcller was hardly right in advising the Brahmists to call themselves Christians, and it is a pity that we so habitually speak of Buddhists and Mohammedans. I venture to remark that the favourite name of the Bahais among themselves is \u2018Friends.\u2019\u2026 Wishing to get nearer to a \u2018human-catholic\u2019 religion I have sought the privilege of simultaneous membership of several brotherhoods of Friends of God. It is my wish to show that both these and other homes of spiritual life are, when studied from the inside, essentially one, and that religions necessarily issue in racial and world-wide unity.\u201d<br><br> Thomas Kelly Cheyne, D.Litt. D.D., was an English divine and Biblical critic. He was born in London and educated at Merchant Taylors\u2019 School, London and Oxford University. Subsequently he studied German theological methods at G\u00f6ttingen. He was ordained in 1864 and held a fellowship at Balliol College, Oxford, 1868-1882. He became Oriel Professor of the Interpretation of Holy Scripture in 1885, which post he resigned in 1908. Cheyne was the first person to meet \u2018Abdu\u2019l-Bah\u00e1, the leader of the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed Faith, on His arrival in Oxford on the 31st of December, 1912. \u2018Abdu\u2019l-Bah\u00e1 was impressed by Cheyne and gave him the epithet Ruh\u00e1n\u00ed (Spiritual) and addressed him as \u201cmy spiritual philosopher\u201d. By 1914, this renowned Christian scholar became a member of the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed Faith. He wrote the present work, The Reconciliation of Races and Religions, in that same year. The book consists mainly of B\u00e1b\u00ed and Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed historical and biographical notes. At the time, membership in the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed Faith did not require one to renounce membership in the church, so he remained a Christian minister. He was also interested in and had sympathies towards other religious teachings and movement such as the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers). (Introduction by Nicholas J.
