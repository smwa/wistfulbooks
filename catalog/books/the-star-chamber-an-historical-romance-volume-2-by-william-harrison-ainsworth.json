{"title": "Star-Chamber: An Historical Romance, Volume 2", "description": "The second volume of a romance with the backdrop of the notorious Star Chamber of the English legal system. The Chamber began as purely administrative, but gradually took on more of a judicial role, enforcing the monarch's will when the courts could or would not do so. As the mix of fact and fiction unfolds in this tale, the court is beginning to lose favor during the reign of James I as the church once again increased its power, while Parliament's power decreased as the monarch tried to rule without them.", "duration": 27414, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "926", "name": "William Harrison Ainsworth"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/star-chamber2_1904_librivox/star_chamber2_1904.jpg", "copyright_year": "1854", "genres": ["Romance"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Lynne T"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Lynne T"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Helen Z.
