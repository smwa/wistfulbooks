{"title": "Monitor and the Merrimac: Both sides of the story", "description": "The American Civil War lasted four years, from 1861 to 1865. It included some iconic battles that have maintained enough interest to merit recounting the events in countless books. One such seminal battle was that of the USS Monitor versus the USS Merrimack, two ironclad ships, repurposed and redesigned to have a defensive advantage against conventional wooden war ships of the 19th century. The Monitor and the Merrimack faced off in a duel in the harbor at Hampton Roads, Virginia. The event represented the beginning of a new era of naval warfare. \u201cThe Monitor and the Merrimac\u201d is a unique historical account of the first-hand experiences and perspectives of soldiers on each of the two ships. - Summary by Jeffery Smith", "duration": 4221, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "14099", "name": "Samuel Greene"}, {"id": "14100", "name": "H.
