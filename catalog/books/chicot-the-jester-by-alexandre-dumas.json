{"title": "Chicot the Jester", "description": "This sequel to Dumas' \u201cMarguerite de Valois\u201d begins four years after the sudden death of King Charles IX and succession of his brother Henry III. The reign of King Henry III was plagued with rebellion and political intrigue due to the War of the Three Henries, where his regency was challenged by King Henry of Navarre (leader of the Huguenots) and Henry I, Duke of Guise (leader of the Catholic League). Dumas weaves two main storylines through this turbulent backdrop: one of the love ignited between le Comte de Bussy and la Dame de Monsoreau, and another of the friendship between King Henry III and his truly unique jester, Chicot (Jean-Antoine d'Anglerais). - Summary by jvanstan", "duration": 55768, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "431", "name": "Alexandre Dumas"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/chicot_jester_1511_librivox/Chicot_1511.jpg", "copyright_year": "0", "genres": ["Fictional Biographies & Memoirs", "Historical Fiction", "Romance"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "John Van Stan"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "John Van Stan"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "pattymarie"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "The wedding of St. Luc", "readers": [9017], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/chicot_jester_1511_librivox/chicotthejester_01_dumas_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1486}, {"section": 2, "title": "How it is not always he who opens the door, who enters the house", "readers": [9017], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/chicot_jester_1511_librivox/chicotthejester_02_dumas_64kb.mp3", "duration": 840}, {"section": 3, "title": "How it is sometimes difficult to distinguish a dream from the reality", "readers": [9017], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/chicot_jester_1511_librivox/chicotthejester_03_dumas_64kb.mp3", "duration": 595}, {"section": 4, "title": "How Madame de St. Luc had passed the night", "readers": [9017], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/chicot_jester_1511_librivox/chicotthejester_04_dumas_64kb.mp3", "duration": 559}, {"section": 5, "title": "How Madame de St. Luc passed the second night of her marriage", "readers": [9017], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/chicot_jester_1511_librivox/chicotthejester_05_dumas_64kb.mp3", "duration": 596}, {"section": 6, "title": "Le petite coucher of Henri III", "readers": [9017], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/chicot_jester_1511_librivox/chicotthejester_06_dumas_64kb.mp3", "duration": 552}, {"section": 7, "title": "How, without anyone knowing why, the king was converted before the next day", "readers": [9017], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/chicot_jester_1511_librivox/chicotthejester_07_dumas_64kb.mp3", "duration": 577}, {"section": 8, "title": "How the king was afraid of being afraid", "readers": [9017], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/chicot_jester_1511_librivox/chicotthejester_08_dumas_64kb.mp3", "duration": 670}, {"section": 9, "title": "How the angel made a mistake and spoke to Chicot, thinking it was the king", "readers": [9017], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/chicot_jester_1511_librivox/chicotthejester_09_dumas_64kb.mp3", "duration": 541}, {"section": 10, "title": "How Bussy went to seek for the reality of his dream", "readers": [9017], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/chicot_jester_1511_librivox/chicotthejester_10_dumas_64kb.mp3", "duration": 802}, {"section": 11, "title": "M.
