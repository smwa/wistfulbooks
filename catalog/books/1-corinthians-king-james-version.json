{"title": "Bible (KJV) NT 07: 1 Corinthians", "description": "<i>The First Epistle of Paul to the Corinthians</i>, often referred to as First Corinthians (and written as 1 Corinthians), is the seventh book of the New Testament of the Bible. Paul of Tarsus composed this letter in Greek, to the Christians of Corinth, Greece. <br/><br/>\nCorinth was the meeting point of many nationalities because the main current of the trade between Asia and western Europe passed through its harbors. <br/><br/>\nPaul wrote 1 Corinthians to correct what he saw as erroneous views in the Corinthian church. Several sources informed Paul of conflicts within the church at Corinth. Paul then wrote this letter to the Corinthians, urging uniformity of belief (\"that ye all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you,\" 1:10) and expounding Christian doctrine.
