{"title": "History of St. Dominic: Founder of the Friars Preachers", "description": "\"The Saint who \u2018studied only in the book of charity,\u2019 who was \u2018the lover of souls,\u2019 because he was \u2018the friend of Jesus Christ,\u2019 who is invoked as \u2018the most kind Father, Dominic,\u2019 distinguished even among the saints for his \u2018matchless serenity,\u2019 and for the tender love that flowed from him as from \u2018a well-spring of sweetness,\u2019 hated heresy out of the very fulness of his love for souls; and the word VERITAS, which has become the motto of his Order, was in his eyes but another form of the yet sweeter word CHARITAS. This truth, dimmed though it may have become in our own age and country, is the real key to the character of St. Dominic, and of all other Saints in whom this enmity to that which opposes the truth is an integral portion of their love of God; a Divine instinct, marking their allegiance to His Supreme Sovereignty, and one which can alone explain both their heroic labours in defence of the faith, and the tears they wept over souls perishing in error.\u201d (Summary taken from the Preface)", "duration": 59322, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "14385", "name": "Augusta Theodosia Drane"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/history_of_st_dominic_2312_librivox/dominic_2312.jpg", "copyright_year": "1891", "genres": ["Christianity - Biographies"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Sonia"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Sonia"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Sonia"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Chapter I.
