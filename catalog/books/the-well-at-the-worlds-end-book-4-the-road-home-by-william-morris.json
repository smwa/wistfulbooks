{"title": "Well at the World's End: Book 4: The Road Home", "description": "In The Well at the World's End, Ralph of Upmeads, youngest son of the King of Upmeads, leaves home (where nothing exciting ever happens) without permission and sets out looking for adventure. When he hears rumors of a well that exudes water with magical properties, he is intrigued and begins his quest. Along the way, he travels through various towns and wildernesses and meets -- and is sometimes led astray by -- a host of interesting people including a mysterious knight, a beautiful woman who may be a goddess, a treacherous servant, a brave tavern wench, a barbarian warrior, a solitary sage, and a sadistic king. Book 4 finishes his adventure. - Summary by Kristingj", "duration": 19653, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "961", "name": "William Morris"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/well_at_the_worlds_end_bk4_1811_librivox/well_worlds_end4_1811.jpg", "copyright_year": "0", "genres": ["Action & Adventure Fiction", "Fantasy Fiction"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "K.G.Cross"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "DrPGould"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Ralph and Ursula Come Back Again Through the Great Mountains", "readers": [2911], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/well_at_the_worlds_end_bk4_1811_librivox/wellworldsendbook4_01_morris_64kb.mp3", "duration": 243}, {"section": 2, "title": "They Hear New Tidings of Utterbol", "readers": [11983], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/well_at_the_worlds_end_bk4_1811_librivox/wellworldsendbook4_02_morris_64kb.mp3", "duration": 466}, {"section": 3, "title": "They Winter With the Sage; and Thereafter Come Again to Vale Turris", "readers": [10526], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/well_at_the_worlds_end_bk4_1811_librivox/wellworldsendbook4_03_morris_64kb.mp3", "duration": 641}, {"section": 4, "title": "A Feast in the Red Pavilion", "readers": [10526], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/well_at_the_worlds_end_bk4_1811_librivox/wellworldsendbook4_04_morris_64kb.mp3", "duration": 359}, {"section": 5, "title": "Bull Telleth of His Winning of the Lordship of Utterbol", "readers": [10526], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/well_at_the_worlds_end_bk4_1811_librivox/wellworldsendbook4_05_morris_64kb.mp3", "duration": 803}, {"section": 6, "title": "They Ride From Vale Turris.
