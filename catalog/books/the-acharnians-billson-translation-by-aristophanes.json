{"title": "Acharnians (Billson Translation)", "description": "Loaded with cryptic, nearly indecipherable inside jokes and double entendres, this early comedy of Aristophanes has a simple, anti-war premise that resounds down the centuries. On flimsy pretexts, greedy politicians have embroiled the nation of Athens in war after war after war. Dic\u00e6opolis is Everyman, an ordinary, plain-speaking citizen fed up with the bumbling, belligerence, and insincerity of the professional leaders. He decides on a whim to make a separate peace with Sparta all by himself, returning with a treaty good for thirty years. Envious of the good deal he has made and of the profit he sees from it, other Athenians try to buy packets of his peace from him, with no success. Puffed up with his own cleverness, Dic\u00e6opolis spends the final scenes of the play ridiculing the muscle-brained neanderthal General Lamachus for faux patriotism and comic chest-beating heroism.<br /><br />\n\nThis translation is by Charles James Billson, who admits in his preface with obvious regret that the chilling effect of \u201cmodern Protestantism\u201d had forced him to prune out the more risque and bawdy bits of Aristophanes\u2019s lines, particularly most of the \u201cPhallic Hymn.\u201d He tries to make up for this unfortunate lack, however, by filling the play with rhyme patterns and slang borrowed from the \u201cburlesque\u201d halls of the 1880s, hoping to render the difficult Greek humor into the form of \u201ca lively acting play.\u201d\n( Expatriate)", "duration": 5752, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "1594", "name": " Aristophanes"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/acharnians_billson_translation_1506_librivox/acharnians_1506.jpg", "copyright_year": "1882", "genres": ["Classics (Greek & Latin Antiquity)", "Satire"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Expatriate"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Expatriate"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Ann Boulais"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "DaveC"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Preface & Introduction", "readers": [8713], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/acharnians_billson_translation_1506_librivox/acharnians_01_aristophanes_64kb.mp3", "duration": 793}, {"section": 2, "title": "Part I", "readers": [8713], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/acharnians_billson_translation_1506_librivox/acharnians_02_aristophanes_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1576}, {"section": 3, "title": "Part II", "readers": [8713], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/acharnians_billson_translation_1506_librivox/acharnians_03_aristophanes_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1837}, {"section": 4, "title": "Part III", "readers": [8713], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/acharnians_billson_translation_1506_librivox/acharnians_04_aristophanes_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1546}]}
