These three stories were all published in the 1960's and no matter what the by-line may look like, be assured they were all written by him in his quirky, imaginative and very entertaining style. The three here for your enjoyment are: With No Strings Attached; The Destroyers and In Case of Fire ", "duration": 8030, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "6276", "name": "Randall Garrett"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/randallgarrett3sfstories_1612_librivox/randall_1612.jpg", "copyright_year": "0", "genres": ["Science Fiction"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Linette Geisel"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "No Strings Attached", "readers": [5717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/randallgarrett3sfstories_1612_librivox/garrett3sfstories_01_garrett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2613}, {"section": 2, "title": "The Destroyers", "readers": [5717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/randallgarrett3sfstories_1612_librivox/garrett3sfstories_02_garrett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 4010}, {"section": 3, "title": "In Case of Fire", "readers": [5717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/randallgarrett3sfstories_1612_librivox/garrett3sfstories_03_garrett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1407}]}
