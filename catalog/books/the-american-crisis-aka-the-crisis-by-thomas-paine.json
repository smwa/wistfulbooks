{"title": "American Crisis aka \"The Crisis\"", "description": "A 13 pamphlet series by 18th century Enlightenment philosopher/author Thomas Paine, published between 1776 to 1783 during and immediately following the American Revolution, gathered into one volume in 1882 by Moncure D. Conway. Each essay, plus 2 inserts, bolstered the morale of the American colonists to fight hard for their independence, appealed to the English to support the colonist's cause, clarified the issues at stake, and denounced any type of negotiated peace. Replete with quotable quotes, the first pamphlet, Crisis I, begins with the now-familiar words \"THESE are the times that try men's souls. The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their country; but he that stands it now, deserves the love and thanks of man and woman.\" Paine, an Englishman living in the colonies, signed his pamphlets anonymously as \"Common Sense.\" ( Michele Fry)", "duration": 29954, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "2273", "name": "Thomas Paine"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/theamericancrisis_1406_librivox/american_crisis_1406.jpg", "copyright_year": "1894", "genres": ["*Non-fiction", "Political Science"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Michele Fry"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Editor's Preface", "readers": [8463], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/theamericancrisis_1406_librivox/theamericancrisis_00_paine_64kb.mp3", "duration": 114}, {"section": 1, "title": "Crisis I, These Are The Times That Try Men's Souls", "readers": [6311], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/theamericancrisis_1406_librivox/theamericancrisis_01_paine_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1391}, {"section": 2, "title": "Crisis II, To Lord Howe", "readers": [8463], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/theamericancrisis_1406_librivox/theamericancrisis_02_paine_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2474}, {"section": 3, "title": "Crisis III, Part I, In The Progress Of Politics", "readers": [9164], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/theamericancrisis_1406_librivox/theamericancrisis_03_paine_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2562}, {"section": 4, "title": "Crisis III, Part II, In The Progress Of Politics", "readers": [9164], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/theamericancrisis_1406_librivox/theamericancrisis_04_paine_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2109}, {"section": 5, "title": "Crisis IV, Those Who Expect To Reap The Blessings Of Freedom", "readers": [8463], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/theamericancrisis_1406_librivox/theamericancrisis_05_paine_64kb.mp3", "duration": 516}, {"section": 6, "title": "Crisis V, Part I, To Gen.
