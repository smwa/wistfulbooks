{"title": "Practice of Perfection and Christian Virtues - Second Treatise", "description": "This work is based on the material which Alphonsus Rodriguez (a Spanish Jesuit priest) collected from his spiritual exhortations to his brethren, and published at the request of his superiors. Although intended for use by his religious brethren, he modified it so it would also profit laypersons. It is a book of practical instructions on all the virtues which perfect the Christian life, whether lived in a monastery or in the world. It became popular at once, and more than 25 editions of the original Spanish have been issued, 60 editions in French, 20 in Italian, 10 in German, and 8 in Latin. This second treatise is on \"Of the perfection of ordinary actions.\" - Summary by Wikipedia (modified)", "duration": 5085, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "15140", "name": "Alphonsus Rodriguez"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/practiceperfectionchristianvirtues2_2501_librivox/practiceofperfection2_2501.jpg", "copyright_year": "1929", "genres": ["Christianity - Other"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "ancientchristian"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "ancientchristian"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Ann Boulais"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Ann Boulais"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Chapter 1: That our advancement and perfection consists in doing   ordinary actions extraordinarily well.", "readers": [14072], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/practiceperfectionchristianvirtues2_2501_librivox/practiceofperfection2_01_rodriguez_64kb.mp3", "duration": 578}, {"section": 2, "title": "Chapter 2: That it ought greatly to animate us to perfection, that   God has put it in something that is very easy.", "readers": [14072], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/practiceperfectionchristianvirtues2_2501_librivox/practiceofperfection2_02_rodriguez_64kb.mp3", "duration": 303}, {"section": 3, "title": "Chapter 3: In what the goodness and perfection of our actions   consists, and of some means to do them well.", "readers": [14072], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/practiceperfectionchristianvirtues2_2501_librivox/practiceofperfection2_03_rodriguez_64kb.mp3", "duration": 696}, {"section": 4, "title": "Chapter 4: Of another means to do our actions well, which is to do them as if we had nothing else to do.", "readers": [14072], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/practiceperfectionchristianvirtues2_2501_librivox/practiceofperfection2_04_rodriguez_64kb.mp3", "duration": 400}, {"section": 5, "title": "Chapter 5: Of another means, which is to do every action as if it were to be the last of our life.", "readers": [14072], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/practiceperfectionchristianvirtues2_2501_librivox/practiceofperfection2_05_rodriguez_64kb.mp3", "duration": 771}, {"section": 6, "title": "Chapter 6: Of another means of doing our actions well, which is to take no account of anything beyond today.", "readers": [14072], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/practiceperfectionchristianvirtues2_2501_librivox/practiceofperfection2_06_rodriguez_64kb.mp3", "duration": 444}, {"section": 7, "title": "Chapter 7: Of another means to do our actions well, which is to get into a way of so doing them.", "readers": [14072], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/practiceperfectionchristianvirtues2_2501_librivox/practiceofperfection2_07_rodriguez_64kb.mp3", "duration": 519}, {"section": 8, "title": "Chapter 8: Of how great importance it is for a Religious not to slow down in the way of virtue.", "readers": [14072], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/practiceperfectionchristianvirtues2_2501_librivox/practiceofperfection2_08_rodriguez_64kb.mp3", "duration": 448}, {"section": 9, "title": "Chapter 9: How important it is for novices to make progress  during the time of their noviciate, and accustom themselves to do the exercises of Religion well.", "readers": [14072], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/practiceperfectionchristianvirtues2_2501_librivox/practiceofperfection2_09_rodriguez_64kb.mp3", "duration": 926}]}
