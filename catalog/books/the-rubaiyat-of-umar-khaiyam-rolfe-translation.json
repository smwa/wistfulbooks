{"title": "Rubaiyat of Umar Khaiyam", "description": "In 1867 Jean Baptiste Nicolas (1814-1875), scholar and career diplomat, published the first major French translation of the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam. This version is in prose and the collection contains 464 verses.<br /><br />In Nicolas\u2019 view, Omar was no Epicurean reveler but rather a relentless spiritual seeker \u2013 his frequent allusions to wine and lovers are metaphors, expressive of a divine discontent that can only be resolved by union with a mystical beloved. However, most other translators and commentators regard Omar as a man who sampled and enjoyed both earthly and philosophical delights.<br /><br />In 1903 Frederic Rolfe, the self styled \u201cBaron Corvo\u201d, published an English translation of Nicolas\u2019 version. In the same year Robert Arnot published a collection of translations which also included an English version of Nicolas\u2019 text. While both these translations are in prose, Rolfe\u2019s version, with its heraldic and evocative verbiage, and its presentation of Omar as a more rounded personality than Nicolas\u2019 etiolated mystic, can be considered, as with Fitzgerald\u2019s celebrated translation, as an independent work of art.
