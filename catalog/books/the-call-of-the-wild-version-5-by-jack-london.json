{"title": "Call of the Wild (Version 5)", "description": "Buck, a magnificent mix of St. Bernard and Scotch shepherd dog, rules contentedly at Judge Miller\u2019s place in California\u2019s Santa Clara Valley. But 1897 brings the Klondike Gold Rush, and Buck is the perfect kind of dog to service sleds\u2014so he is stolen and spirited away to the Northland. There he learns a hard life at the hands of tough men and competing sled dogs, which sharpen his instincts and survival skills. Thousands of miles of grueling sled travel and toil nearly wear Buck out, until chance in the form of John Thornton saves him. This \u201cideal master\u201d proves the only man worthy of Buck\u2019s unconditional love.  Despite his newfound companionship, however, the growing lure of Buck\u2019s primitive ancestral heritage, the \u201csong of a younger world\u201d awakened by the wild harsh beauty of his environment, vies for that love. Only chance once again resolves the tension between love and nature\u2026 and allows Buck to fulfill his glorious, bittersweet destiny.<br /><br />\n\nA personal note from the reader: I think that my characterization of this book follows the way I found myself reading it.
