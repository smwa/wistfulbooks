The world over, every country subjected to foreign influence or subjugated to foreign control has their own story shaped by economics, civics, development, environment, culture, geography, diplomacy and people.\r\n\r\nThere is no single experience with imperialism, and yet I suspect most people would not judge Samoa\u2019s experience to be particularly exceptional either.\r\n\r\nRobert Louis Stephenson\u2019s <i>A Footnote to History</i> is a particularly engaging account for being a pedestrian\u2019s-eye view of imperialism at work. In Stephenson\u2019s own words, his story is largely \u201c. . . one of rapacity, intrigue and the triumphs of temper\u201d.  There is that. Cultures clash. Ordinary people are caught in the gears\u2014while others are simply spectators, swept along. There are schemers too. Those seeking to shape the world to their own designs. Those who wrought this Samoan Crisis. Many of them are caught in the gears too.  \r\n\r\nStephenson\u2019s treatment of many of the subjects who populate this account is penetrating and sympathetic\u2014be that the irascible Colonel Henry de Coetlogon, the savvy and resolute chief Mataafa or the upright but unbending Captain Eugen Brandeis to name but a few.\r\n\r\nWhy all this fuss? What great riches would bring industrial behemoths like the Germany and the United States to the brink of war? For what bounty do they contend in these islands, so far from their own shores?\r\n\r\nThey contend for the commercial production of copra\u2014dried coconut meat from which coconut oil can be extracted. Coconut oil is an ingredient which can be used in margarine. During the late 19th century, copra was produced across the region including in the Philippines, Tonga, the Dutch East Indies and New Guinea.\r\n\r\nLurking behind men like Heinrich Becker and Wilhelm Knappe, Richard Phillips Leary and Harold Marsh Sewall, ever-present are the interests of certain business groups as perhaps embodied on the ground by men like Theodor Weber (Misi Ueba), and Stevenson\u2019s own friend Harry Jay Moors (Misimoa)\u2014whom he described in a letter as the \u201cablest, wealthiest and best-informed trader in Samoa\u201d. From lobbying in Washington to smuggling in and directly supplying Mataafa\u2019s forces with ammunition, traders like Moors were no mere bystanders but power players.\r\n\r\nUltimately, for all the acquisitiveness and power games of man\u2014there is no more apt reminder of where in the schema of our world that true power lies than the first Samoan civil war. \r\n\r\n\u201cDo not let us weep,\u201d said one Samoan in 1887 before Laupepa\u2019s exile, \u201cWe have no cause for shame.  We do not yield to Tamasese, but to the invincible strangers.\u201d The strangers with their science and their industry would prove to be quite vincible, after all. Whenever Nature unleashes even a desultory shadow of shattering violence of which it is truly capable, even the mighty tremble and our contentions fall away. \r\n\r\nAt least for a time.
