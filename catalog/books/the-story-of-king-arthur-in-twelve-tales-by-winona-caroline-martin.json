{"title": "Story of King Arthur, in Twelve Tales", "description": "Of all the legends of bygone ages which we in the foremost ranks of time may call our own perhaps none have come to us so fraught with the spirit of lofty idealism as those which cluster about the figure of King Arthur of Britain and the mystic Quest of the Holy Grail. <br></br>In their devious wanderings down the centuries they have gradually been purified of all original coarseness while still retaining that wonderful charm and simplicity which belongs to the tales of the childhood of the race. Furthermore, upon the lips of many a bard, both ancient and modern, they have become literature, so that they are now the rightful heritage of the child of to-day and should, in one form or another, find a place in every class room as supplementary reading at least. <br></br>Because, for obvious reasons, in dealing with young children, the versions of the masters have not always proved practicable, the author has ventured to offer this little volume which grew out of a library story-hour trusting that it may be useful to mothers, teachers, children\u2019s librarians and others who are endeavouring to hold before the children of a materialistic age that vision without which the people perish.  - Summary by Winona Caroline Martin", "duration": 18329, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "13324", "name": "Winona Caroline Martin"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/librivoxcdcoverart34/kingarthur_1808.jpg", "copyright_year": "1915", "genres": ["Action & Adventure"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Crln Yldz Ksr"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Crln Yldz Ksr"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Scotty Smith"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Heroes, by Gertrude C.
