{"title": "Strangers at Lisconnel", "description": "Strangers at Lisconnel is a sequel to Jane Barlow\u2019s Irish Idylls. The locations and most of the characters are common to both. There is great humor and concomitantly a certain melancholy in most of these stories of the most rural of rural places in Ireland. Although of a higher social class than her characters, Our Jane seems to have a touch of softness in her heart for their utter simplicity, abject poverty and naivet\u00e9. From the following brief example of dialogue, can be seen that Ms Barlow could only have come to write these words after having heard them countless times in person: Mrs. Kilfoyle: \"I declare, now, you'd whiles think things knew what you was manin' in your mind, and riz themselves up agin it a' purpose to prevint you, they happen that conthr\u00e1ry.\" Although Jane Barlow did not consider her poetry worthwhile, the rythmn and music of her prose is magical to the ear.
