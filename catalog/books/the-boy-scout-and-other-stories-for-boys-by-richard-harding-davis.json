{"title": "Boy Scout And Other Stories For Boys", "description": "RICHARD HARDING DAVIS, as a friend and fellow author has written of him, was \u201cyouth incarnate,\u201d and there is probably nothing that he wrote of which a boy would not some day come to feel the appeal. But there are certain of his stories that go with especial directness to a boy\u2019s heart and sympathies and make for him quite unforgettable literature. A few of these were made some years ago into a volume, \u201cStories for Boys,\u201d and found a large and enthusiastic special public in addition to Davis\u2019s general readers; and the present collection from stories more recently published is issued with the same motive. This book takes its title from \u201cThe Boy Scout,\u201d the first of its tales; and it includes \u201cThe Boy Who Cried Wolf,\u201d \u201cBlood Will Tell,\u201d the immortal \u201cGallegher,\u201d and \u201cThe Bar Sinister,\u201d Davis\u2019s famous dog story. It is a fresh volume added to what Augustus Thomas calls \u201csafe stuff to give to a young fellow who likes to take off his hat and dilate his nostrils and feel the wind in his face.\u201d (Summary by Publisher's Note in book)", "duration": 17826, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "812", "name": "Richard Harding Davis"}], "coverArt": " http://archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt18/boy_scout_1206.jpg", "copyright_year": "1891", "genres": ["Children's Fiction", "Action & Adventure", "Short works"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "David Wales"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "David Wales"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "TriciaG"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "midgecoates"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Publisher's Note", "readers": [6454], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/boy_scout_dw_librivox/boyscout_00_davis_64kb.mp3", "duration": 116}, {"section": 1, "title": "The Boy Scout", "readers": [6454], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/boy_scout_dw_librivox/boyscout_01_davis_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2348}, {"section": 2, "title": "The Boy Who Cried Wolf", "readers": [6454], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/boy_scout_dw_librivox/boyscout_02_davis_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2453}, {"section": 3, "title": "Gallegher, A Newspaper Story, Part 1", "readers": [6454], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/boy_scout_dw_librivox/boyscout_03_davis_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2116}, {"section": 4, "title": "Gallegher, A Newspaper Story, Part 2", "readers": [6454], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/boy_scout_dw_librivox/boyscout_04_davis_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2324}, {"section": 5, "title": "Blood Will Tell, Part 1", "readers": [6454], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/boy_scout_dw_librivox/boyscout_05_davis_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1695}, {"section": 6, "title": "Blood Will Tell, Part 2", "readers": [6454], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/boy_scout_dw_librivox/boyscout_06_davis_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1606}, {"section": 7, "title": "The Bar Sinister, Part 1", "readers": [6454], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/boy_scout_dw_librivox/boyscout_07_davis_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2868}, {"section": 8, "title": "The Bar Sinister, Part 2", "readers": [6454], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/boy_scout_dw_librivox/boyscout_08_davis_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2300}]}
