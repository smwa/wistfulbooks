{"title": "Brain and the Voice in Speech and Song", "description": "From the Preface: \"The contents of this little book formed the subject of three lectures delivered at the Royal Institution \"On the Mechanism of the Human Voice\" and three London University lectures at King's College on \"The Brain in relation to Speech and Song.\" I have endeavoured to place this subject before my readers in as simple language as scientific accuracy and requirements permit. Where I have been obliged to use technical anatomical and physiological terms I have either explained their meaning in the text, aided by diagrams and figures, or I have given in brackets the English equivalents of the terms used. I trust my attempt to give a sketch of the mechanism of the human voice, and how it is produced in speech and song, may prove of interest to the general public, and I even hope that teachers of voice production may find some of the pages dealing with the brain mechanism not unworthy of their attention.\" ", "duration": 8594, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "15632", "name": "Frederick Walker Mott"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/brainandvoice_2105_librivox/brainvoice_2105.jpg", "copyright_year": "1910", "genres": ["Life Sciences"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Marya James"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Marya James"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "J.
