{"title": "Life is a Dream", "description": "Of all Calderon's works, \"Life is a Dream\" may be regarded as the most universal in its theme. It seeks to teach a lesson that may be learned from the philosophers and religious thinkers of many ages\u2014that the world of our senses is a mere shadow, and that the only reality is to be found in the invisible and eternal. The story which forms its basis is Oriental in origin, and in the form of the legend of \"Barlaam and Josaphat\" was familiar in all the literatures of the Middle Ages. Combined with this in the plot is the tale of Abou Hassan from the \"Arabian Nights,\" the main situations in which are turned to farcical purposes in the Induction to the Shakespearean \"Taming of the Shrew.\" But with Calderon the theme is lifted altogether out of the atmosphere of comedy, and is worked up with poetic sentiment and a touch of mysticism into a symbolic drama of profound and universal philosophical significance. \n - Summary by The Translator <br> <br>\nWe also have this in the original Spanish: https://librivox.org/la-vida-es-sueno-by-pedro-calderon-de-la-barca/ \n<BR><BR>Cast list:<BR>\nBasilio, King of Poland: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/4705\">Algy Pug</a><br>\nSegismund, his Son: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/13738\">Seaquill</a><br>\nAstolfo, his Nephew: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/5635\">Matthew Reece</a><br>\nEstrella, his Niece: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/14141\">Christine</a><br>\nClotaldo, a General in Basilio's Service: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/7170\">Alan Mapstone</a><br>\nRosaura, a Muscovite Lady: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/4174\">Availle</a><br>\nFife, her Attendant: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/8879\">Son of the Exiles</a><br>\nChamberlain: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/14426\">Andrew James</a><br>\nLord in Waiting: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/6754\">ToddHW</a><br>\nCaptain: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/14337\">ambsweet13</a><br>\nSoldier 1: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/6754\">ToddHW</a><br>\nSoldier 2: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/10179\">Sonia</a><br>\nStage Directions: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/13577\">Adrian Stephens</a><br>\nEditing: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/6754\">ToddHW</a>", "duration": 7644, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "5858", "name": " Pedro Calder\u00f3n de la Barca"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/lifeisadream_2009_librivox/life_is_a_dream_2009.jpg", "copyright_year": "1865", "genres": ["Drama"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "ToddHW"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "ToddHW"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "cadastra"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Act 1", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/lifeisadream_2009_librivox/lifeisadream_1_calderon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2746}, {"section": 2, "title": "Act 2", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/lifeisadream_2009_librivox/lifeisadream_2_calderon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2250}, {"section": 3, "title": "Act 3", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/lifeisadream_2009_librivox/lifeisadream_3_calderon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1964}, {"section": 4, "title": "Act 4", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/lifeisadream_2009_librivox/lifeisadream_4_calderon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 684}]}
