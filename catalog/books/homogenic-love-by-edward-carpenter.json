{"title": "Homogenic Love and Its Place in a Free Society", "description": "This pamphlet by LGBT pioneer and philosopher Edward Carpenter was originally intended to form part of his work \"Love's Coming of Age\", but was removed following public discourse on the Oscar Wilde trials of 1895. It was subsequently published privately and circulated among his inner circle. This is Carpenter's first publication on the subject of homosexuality, and displays his typical forward-thinking and utopian sentiments. It seeks to make clear that homosexuality is innate, is more widespread than generally accepted, and even implies that degress of bisexuality may be universal.  - Summary by Jake Malizia", "duration": 4506, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "8424", "name": "Edward Carpenter"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/homogenic_love_2112_librivox/homogenic_love_2112.jpg", "copyright_year": "1894", "genres": ["Essays & Short Works"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Jake Malizia"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Jake Malizia"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Sonia"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Verla Viera"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Section 1", "readers": [16463], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/homogenic_love_2112_librivox/homogeniclove_1_carpenter_64kb.mp3", "duration": 918}, {"section": 2, "title": "Section 2", "readers": [16463], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/homogenic_love_2112_librivox/homogeniclove_2_carpenter_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1111}, {"section": 3, "title": "Section 3", "readers": [16463], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/homogenic_love_2112_librivox/homogeniclove_3_carpenter_64kb.mp3", "duration": 964}, {"section": 4, "title": "Section 4", "readers": [16463], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/homogenic_love_2112_librivox/homogeniclove_4_carpenter_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1513}]}
