{"title": "Just So Stories (version 2)", "description": "The stories, first published in 1902, are fantastic accounts of how various natural phenomena came about. The original editions of Just So Stories were illustrated with woodcuts by Kipling himself.  Read along online and see the illustrations at <a href=\"http://www.mainlesson.com/display.php?author=kipling&book=just&story=_contents\">mainlesson.com</a>. Each story is accompanied by a poem, in a somewhat ballad style. Many of the stories are addressed to \"Best Beloved\" (they were first written for Kipling's eldest daughter, Josephine, who had died during an outbreak of influenza in 1899), and throughout they use a comically elevated style inspired by the formal speech of India, full of long and improbable-sounding words, some of them made up. As a result, it is a delight to read them aloud, and easy to memorise passages from them.
