{"title": "Canadian Summer Evening", "description": "From this imperfect sketch of Mrs. Leprohon\u2019s literary life it will be seen that she was no sluggard. But we would leave a wrong impression if we gave it to be understood that all her time was passed in the writing of either poems or tales. Far from it. They constituted but one phase in a life nobly, yet unostentatiously, consecrated to the duties of home, of society, of charity and of religion. Mrs. Leprohon was much more than either a poet or a novelist\u2014she was, also, in the highest sense, a woman, a lady. Had she never written a verse of poetry or a page of prose, she would still have been lovingly remembered for what she was as wife, as mother, as friend.

Mullins))", "duration": 1325, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "9920", "name": "Rosanna Eleanor Leprohon"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/a_canadian_summer_evening_1708.poem_librivox/canadiansummerevening_1708.jpg", "copyright_year": "1881", "genres": ["Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "A Canadian Summer Evening - Read by ALP", "readers": [4705], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/a_canadian_summer_evening_1708.poem_librivox/summerevening_leprohon_alp_64kb.mp3", "duration": 117}, {"section": 2, "title": "A Canadian Summer Evening - Read by BK", "readers": [8786], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/a_canadian_summer_evening_1708.poem_librivox/summerevening_leprohon_bk_64kb.mp3", "duration": 127}, {"section": 3, "title": "A Canadian Summer Evening - Read by CM", "readers": [11918], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/a_canadian_summer_evening_1708.poem_librivox/summerevening_leprohon_cm_64kb.mp3", "duration": 92}, {"section": 4, "title": "A Canadian Summer Evening - Read by DL", "readers": [2911], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/a_canadian_summer_evening_1708.poem_librivox/summerevening_leprohon_dl_64kb.mp3", "duration": 114}, {"section": 5, "title": "A Canadian Summer Evening - Read by EL", "readers": [9872], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/a_canadian_summer_evening_1708.poem_librivox/summerevening_leprohon_el_64kb.mp3", "duration": 143}, {"section": 6, "title": "A Canadian Summer Evening - Read by EMP", "readers": [11783], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/a_canadian_summer_evening_1708.poem_librivox/summerevening_leprohon_emp_64kb.mp3", "duration": 123}, {"section": 7, "title": "A Canadian Summer Evening - Read by GB", "readers": [4969], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/a_canadian_summer_evening_1708.poem_librivox/summerevening_leprohon_gb_64kb.mp3", "duration": 124}, {"section": 8, "title": "A Canadian Summer Evening - Read by LAH", "readers": [1212], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/a_canadian_summer_evening_1708.poem_librivox/summerevening_leprohon_lah_64kb.mp3", "duration": 121}, {"section": 9, "title": "A Canadian Summer Evening - Read by PS", "readers": [8576], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/a_canadian_summer_evening_1708.poem_librivox/summerevening_leprohon_ps_64kb.mp3", "duration": 101}, {"section": 10, "title": "A Canadian Summer Evening - Read by TP", "readers": [10789], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/a_canadian_summer_evening_1708.poem_librivox/summerevening_leprohon_tp_64kb.mp3", "duration": 128}, {"section": 11, "title": "A Canadian Summer Evening - Read by VB", "readers": [8169], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/a_canadian_summer_evening_1708.poem_librivox/summerevening_leprohon_vb_64kb.mp3", "duration": 135}]}
