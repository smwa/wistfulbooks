{"title": "Primary Reader: Old-time Stories, Fairy Tales and Myths Retold by Children (Version 2)", "description": "\"This book originated in a series of little reading lessons prepared for the first grade pupils in the Santa Rosa public schools. The object of the lessons was three-fold: to provide reading matter for the little ones who had only a small vocabulary of sight-words; to acquaint them early with the heroes who have come down to us in song and story; and to create a desire for literature...Various stories were given to the pupils; discussions followed. After a time the story was produced orally by the children. Notes were made on expressions used and points of interest dwelt upon. Later the story was either written on the blackboard or mimeographed and put into the pupils' hands to read...Hoping these stories will interest other children as they have interested those who helped build them, I send them forth.\" - Summary by E.
