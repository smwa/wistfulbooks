She was a great poet who composed A Legend of Northland which is a very beautiful poem. The sisters co-published poems in 1849, and then each went on to publish volumes of their own. After their deaths in 1871, joint anthologies of the sisters' unpublished poems were also compiled.  - Summary by Wikipedia", "duration": 2804, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "1758", "name": "Phoebe Cary"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/they_didnt_think_2302.poem_librivox/they_didnt_think_2303.jpg", "copyright_year": "1881", "genres": ["Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "redrun"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "redrun"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "They Didn't Think - Read by APS", "readers": [13577], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/they_didnt_think_2302.poem_librivox/theydidntthink_cary_aps_64kb.mp3", "duration": 161}, {"section": 2, "title": "They Didn't Think - Read by AT", "readers": [15866], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/they_didnt_think_2302.poem_librivox/theydidntthink_cary_at_64kb.mp3", "duration": 129}, {"section": 3, "title": "They Didn't Think - Read by BC", "readers": [14624], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/they_didnt_think_2302.poem_librivox/theydidntthink_cary_bc_64kb.mp3", "duration": 137}, {"section": 4, "title": "They Didn't Think - Read by BK", "readers": [8786], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/they_didnt_think_2302.poem_librivox/theydidntthink_cary_bk_64kb.mp3", "duration": 178}, {"section": 5, "title": "They Didn't Think - Read by BM", "readers": [4570], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/they_didnt_think_2302.poem_librivox/theydidntthink_cary_bm_64kb.mp3", "duration": 177}, {"section": 6, "title": "They Didn't Think - Read by DC", "readers": [16764], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/they_didnt_think_2302.poem_librivox/theydidntthink_cary_dc_64kb.mp3", "duration": 134}, {"section": 7, "title": "They Didn't Think - Read by DK", "readers": [18347], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/they_didnt_think_2302.poem_librivox/theydidntthink_cary_dk_64kb.mp3", "duration": 138}, {"section": 8, "title": "They Didn't Think - Read by EN", "readers": [18344], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/they_didnt_think_2302.poem_librivox/theydidntthink_cary_en_64kb.mp3", "duration": 153}, {"section": 9, "title": "They Didn't Think - Read by IKL", "readers": [17662], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/they_didnt_think_2302.poem_librivox/theydidntthink_cary_ikl_64kb.mp3", "duration": 113}, {"section": 10, "title": "They Didn't Think - Read by JBW", "readers": [10159], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/they_didnt_think_2302.poem_librivox/theydidntthink_cary_jbw_64kb.mp3", "duration": 165}, {"section": 11, "title": "They Didn't Think - Read by LCW", "readers": [8425], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/they_didnt_think_2302.poem_librivox/theydidntthink_cary_lcw_64kb.mp3", "duration": 148}, {"section": 12, "title": "They Didn't Think - Read by LS", "readers": [15365], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/they_didnt_think_2302.poem_librivox/theydidntthink_cary_ls_64kb.mp3", "duration": 151}, {"section": 13, "title": "They Didn't Think - Read by MLM", "readers": [14499], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/they_didnt_think_2302.poem_librivox/theydidntthink_cary_mlm_64kb.mp3", "duration": 170}, {"section": 14, "title": "They Didn't Think - Read by NB", "readers": [7146], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/they_didnt_think_2302.poem_librivox/theydidntthink_cary_nb_64kb.mp3", "duration": 177}, {"section": 15, "title": "They Didn't Think - Read by QTN", "readers": [18128], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/they_didnt_think_2302.poem_librivox/theydidntthink_cary_qtn_64kb.mp3", "duration": 149}, {"section": 16, "title": "They Didn't Think - Read by RR", "readers": [17752], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/they_didnt_think_2302.poem_librivox/theydidntthink_cary_rr_64kb.mp3", "duration": 170}, {"section": 17, "title": "They Didn't Think - Read by TM", "readers": [7997], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/they_didnt_think_2302.poem_librivox/theydidntthink_cary_tm_64kb.mp3", "duration": 207}, {"section": 18, "title": "They Didn't Think - Read by WA", "readers": [17246], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/they_didnt_think_2302.poem_librivox/theydidntthink_cary_wa_64kb.mp3", "duration": 147}]}
