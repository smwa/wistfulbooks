{"title": "Manfred (Version 2)", "description": "Manfred is a Dramatic Poem written by Lord Byron in 1816-7 after he left England for the last time and shortly after the famous ghost story telling session at the Villa Diordati by Lake Geneva involving Byron, Percy and Mary Shelley and John Polidori which also led to the writing of Frankenstein and The Vampyre. It contains many of the supernatural elements of Gothic Fiction but also describes the internal torment of the central character caused by guilt at unspecified actions in his past life which may have resulted in the death of his beloved. The poem explores issues of morality, guilt, religion and the human condition. Many people think that this work is Byron's attempt to come to terms with his own guilt at some of the immoral and illegal actions which forced him to flee England.\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough never intended for the stage it was performed at Covent Garden Theatre in London in 1834. It also inspired musical works by Schumann and Tchaikovsky.
