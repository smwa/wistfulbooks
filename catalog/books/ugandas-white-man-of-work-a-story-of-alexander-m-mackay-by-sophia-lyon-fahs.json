{"title": "Uganda's White Man of Work: A Story of Alexander M. Mackay", "description": "When Henry Stanley (the famous journalist who went to find David Livingstone) was in Africa , he met a king named Mutesa. This king had started believing his tribe's Ugandan traditions about spirits and devils. Then some Arabs came through and Mutesa converted to Islam. When Mr. Stanley came and told Mutesa about God, Mutesa became a Christian and asked Mr. Stanley to get the English to send back missionaries so he and his tribe could learn more about God. Alexander Mackay was one of those courageous men who answered the call.
