{"title": "Offences Against One's Self: Paederasty", "description": "Jeremy Bentham (1748-1832) was an English jurist, philosopher, and legal and social reformer. He was a political radical and a leading theorist in Anglo-American philosophy of law. He is best known as an early advocate of utilitarianism and animal rights who influenced the development of liberalism. <br /><br />The essay Offences Against One's Self (c. 1785), argued for the liberalisation of laws prohibiting homosexuality.
