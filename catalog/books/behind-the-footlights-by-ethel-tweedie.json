{"title": "Behind the Footlights", "description": "In this collection of essays the author gives us an opportunity to peek into the mysterious life of the theatre; she recalls her numerous conversations with and anecdotes about the \"stage folk\", such as actors, actresses, playwrights, stage directors or managers. However, her portrayal of theatrical life doesn't aim at glamorising the profession and the day-to-day life of those connected with the stage. On the contrary, if there's one overarching theme to her stories it is the repeated assurance that it's a hard and precarious existence, even for those at the top of the profession, let alone those who play minor parts and are rarely mentioned.
