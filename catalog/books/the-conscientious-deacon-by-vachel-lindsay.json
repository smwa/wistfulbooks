{"title": "Conscientious Deacon", "description": "LibriVox volunteers bring you 14 recordings of <i>The Conscientious Deacon</i> by Vachel Lindsay. This was the Weekly Poetry project for May 5th, 2013.<br /><br />Vachel Lindsay described this poem as \"a song to be syncopated as you please\". According to Wikipedia he is considered the father of modern singing poetry (as he referred to it) in which verses are meant to be sung or chanted. His extensive correspondence with the poet Yeats details his intentions to revive the musical qualities in poetry as had been practised by the ancient Greeks.
