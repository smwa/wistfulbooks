{"title": "Measure for Measure (version 3)", "description": "<i>Measure for Measure</i> is one of William Shakespeare's more enigmatic works. As one of the so-called \"problem plays,\" it mixes a dark plot with light overtones, without resolving the tensions inherent in either. Its central conflict is spurred on when the Duke of Vienna, Vincentio, confers his powers on the law-abiding judge Angelo before leaving on a diplomatic mission. In reality, Vincentio has merely disguised himself as a lowly friar to watch Angelo's rule from afar\u2014a rule that is quickly characterized by its overzealous cruelty and harshness. When Angelo has a man condemned to death for fornication, the man's sister, a pious novitiate named Isabella, intercedes on his behalf and begs Angelo for leniency. It is through this encounter that Angelo's true self emerges, as well as the play's presiding themes of moral justice, civil corruption, and the neverending conflict between the powers of sin and virtue. Can Isabella thwart Angelo's wicked intentions? Will the Duke restore peace and sanity in Vienna? Will compassion prevail? Take a listen, for all will be revealed.<br><br>And to perform it all?
