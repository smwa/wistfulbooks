{"title": "Where We Got the Bible: Our Debt to the Catholic Church", "description": "In \"Where We Got the Bible\", the author, himself a convert from Calvinism, explains how the Catholic Church compiled the sacred text, how medieval monks preserved it, and how Catholic scholars first gave Christians the Bible in their own languages.<br><br>\nThis little book about the Bible grew out of lectures which the writer delivered on the subject to mixed audiences. The lectures were afterwards expanded, and appeared in a series of articles in the Catholic press 1908-9, and are now with slight alterations reprinted. Their origin will sufficiently account for the colloquial style employed throughout. <br><br>\n\nThere is, therefore, no pretense either of profound scholarship or of eloquent language; all that is attempted is a popular and, as far as possible, accurate exposition along familiar lines of the Catholic claim historically in regard to the Bible. It is candidly controversial without, however, let us hope, being uncharitable or unfair.
