{"title": "Diaries of Adam and Eve", "description": "Mark Twain wrote these two diaries, or rather as he insists, 'translated them from the original manuscripts', late in his writing career.  The freshness, wonder and excitement of exploring a new world permeates Eve's thoughts as she takes great joy in her very existence and loves everything about it.  To me this is obviously a posthumous love-letter to Twain's wife Olivia Langdon Clemens, or Livy, who died in June 1904, but others may disagree.  Adam's diary is different and he comes across as a somewhat surly person who just wants to be alone and think his thoughts.  he is also not very bright.  How the two finally come together is what makes these stories so wonderful and expresses the love between a husband and wife.  They were written as two separate works but fit together so well I have combined them into one here.      - Summary by phil chenevert", "duration": 4510, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "9", "name": "Mark Twain"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/thediariesofadamandeve_1809_librivox/adam_eve_diary_1809.jpg", "copyright_year": "0", "genres": ["Humorous Fiction"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Linette Geisel"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Eve's Diary", "readers": [5717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/thediariesofadamandeve_1809_librivox/diariesofadamandeve_01_twain_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2699}, {"section": 2, "title": "Extract from Adam's Diary", "readers": [5717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/thediariesofadamandeve_1809_librivox/diariesofadamandeve_02_twain_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1811}]}
