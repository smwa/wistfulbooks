{"title": "Booklover and His Books", "description": "This book about books was written by Harry Lyman Koopman, who served as the head librarian for Brown University from 1893 to 1930. Published in 1917, the volume is dedicated \u201cTo the authors and their printers who have given us the books that we love.\u201d\r\n\r\nA collection of essays about many different aspects of books, Koopman describes it this way in the preface: \u201cThe following chapters were written during a series of years as one aspect after another of the Book engaged the writer's attention. As they are now brought together, the result is not a systematic treatise, but rather a succession of views of one many-sided subject.\u201d\r\n\r\nAny booklover will enjoy browsing this wide variety of essays that range from a discussion of the value and privilege of reading, to spelling reform, to aspects of the book as a physical object and a work of art. - Summary by Verla Viera", "duration": 20073, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "17448", "name": "Henry Lyman Koopman"}], "coverArt": null, "copyright_year": "1917", "genres": ["Essays & Short Works"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Verla Viera"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "J.
