{"title": "Airship Boys in the Great War", "description": "Little did Alan, Ned and Buck suspect what they were getting themselves in for when they approached the editor of The Herald with their plan to re-employ the Ocean Flyer, flying it back across the Atlantic Ocean to rescue their friend and the newspaper\u2019s reporter, Bob Russell, from the clutches of the German military, who had taken him prisoner, accused him of spying, and, possibly, might condemn him to face a firing squad in the early days of \u201cThe Great War\u201d in Europe during 1914. All they knew was they had to do something to help Bob and, hopefully, Mr. Latimer, managing editor of The Herald, would help.
