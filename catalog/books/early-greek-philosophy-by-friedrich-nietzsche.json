{"title": "Early Greek Philosophy and Other Essays", "description": "The essays contained in this volume treat of various subjects. With the exception of perhaps one we must consider all these papers as fragments. Written during the early Seventies, and intended mostly as prefaces, they are extremely interesting, since traces of Nietzsche's later tenets \u2014 like Slave and Master morality, the Superman \u2014 can be found everywhere.
