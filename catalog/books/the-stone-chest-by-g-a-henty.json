{"title": "Stone Chest", "description": "When the\u00a0ship, Bluebell,\u00a0went down, Captain Cromwell and Ruel Gross escaped on a raft, and after several days of suffering, finally reached Cedar Island.\r\nThey found a stone chest, and Captain Cromwell was captured by savages. Gross managed to escape gravely injured, but before expiring, told Mrs. Cromwell and son, Bob, that their husband and father was still alive when he escaped. Bob resolved immediately he must try to rescue his father if that was so, because everyone believes he is dead. But the long journey won't be easy. He and his mom manage to get passage on the Dart, but there will be terrible weather and potentially fatal icebergs to fight, a madman, savages, and a host of other events that will put everyone's lives in danger. And is Captain Cromwell still alive; will he be rescued? Will a Stone Chest be found, and if so, what is in that Stone Chest? Mystery and Adventure awaits!
