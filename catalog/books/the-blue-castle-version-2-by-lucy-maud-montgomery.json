{"title": "Blue Castle (Version 2)", "description": "\"The Blue Castle\" by L. M. Montgomery tells the story of Valancy Stirling, a repressed and timid woman living under the control of her overbearing family in the small town of Deerwood. With her health being a constant concern and her life devoid of joy, Valancy finds solace in her dreams and imaginations. However, everything changes when she receives a shocking medical diagnosis, which prompts her to break free from her constrained existence.\r\n\r\nDetermined to live life on her own terms, Valancy decides to seize the opportunity to experience the world beyond the confines of Deerwood. She accepts an invitation from Barney Snaith, a mysterious and unconventional man, to join him in the remote Blue Castle. In this picturesque setting, Valancy discovers love, freedom, and the courage to be herself.\r\n\r\nAs Valancy explores her newfound independence, she learns to confront societal expectations and embrace her true desires. With Barney by her side, she finds companionship and a sense of belonging that she had never known before. Together, they embark on a journey of self-discovery, defying convention and embracing the beauty of life's possibilities.\r\n\r\n\"The Blue Castle\" is a heartwarming tale of transformation, resilience, and the pursuit of happiness in the face of adversity. Through Valancy's journey, Montgomery celebrates the power of love, imagination, and the human spirit to overcome life's challenges and find fulfillment. - Summary by Bryn Roberts", "duration": 28381, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "75", "name": "Lucy Maud Montgomery"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/bluecastle_2406_librivox/bluecastle_2406.jpg", "copyright_year": "1926", "genres": ["Romance"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Bryn Roberts"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Bryn Roberts"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "TriciaG"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "mleigh"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Ch 1", "readers": [18007], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/bluecastle_2406_librivox/bluecastle_01_montgomery_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1402}, {"section": 2, "title": "Ch 2 & 3", "readers": [18007], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/bluecastle_2406_librivox/bluecastle_02_montgomery_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1181}, {"section": 3, "title": "Ch 4 & 5", "readers": [18007], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/bluecastle_2406_librivox/bluecastle_03_montgomery_64kb.mp3", "duration": 909}, {"section": 4, "title": "Ch 6 & 7", "readers": [18007], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/bluecastle_2406_librivox/bluecastle_04_montgomery_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1494}, {"section": 5, "title": "Ch 8", "readers": [18007], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/bluecastle_2406_librivox/bluecastle_05_montgomery_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1296}, {"section": 6, "title": "Ch 9 & 10", "readers": [18007], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/bluecastle_2406_librivox/bluecastle_06_montgomery_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1371}, {"section": 7, "title": "Ch 11", "readers": [18007], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/bluecastle_2406_librivox/bluecastle_07_montgomery_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1616}, {"section": 8, "title": "Ch 12-14", "readers": [18007], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/bluecastle_2406_librivox/bluecastle_08_montgomery_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1372}, {"section": 9, "title": "Ch 15-17", "readers": [18007], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/bluecastle_2406_librivox/bluecastle_09_montgomery_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1230}, {"section": 10, "title": "Ch 18 & 19", "readers": [18007], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/bluecastle_2406_librivox/bluecastle_10_montgomery_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1538}, {"section": 11, "title": "Ch 20", "readers": [18007], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/bluecastle_2406_librivox/bluecastle_11_montgomery_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1127}, {"section": 12, "title": "Ch 21 & 22", "readers": [18007], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/bluecastle_2406_librivox/bluecastle_12_montgomery_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1140}, {"section": 13, "title": "Ch 23-25", "readers": [18007], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/bluecastle_2406_librivox/bluecastle_13_montgomery_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1444}, {"section": 14, "title": "Ch 26", "readers": [18007], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/bluecastle_2406_librivox/bluecastle_14_montgomery_64kb.mp3", "duration": 658}, {"section": 15, "title": "Ch 27", "readers": [18007], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/bluecastle_2406_librivox/bluecastle_15_montgomery_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1415}, {"section": 16, "title": "Ch 28-30", "readers": [18007], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/bluecastle_2406_librivox/bluecastle_16_montgomery_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1515}, {"section": 17, "title": "Ch 31 & 32", "readers": [18007], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/bluecastle_2406_librivox/bluecastle_17_montgomery_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1495}, {"section": 18, "title": "Ch 33-35", "readers": [18007], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/bluecastle_2406_librivox/bluecastle_18_montgomery_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1254}, {"section": 19, "title": "Ch 36 & 37", "readers": [18007], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/bluecastle_2406_librivox/bluecastle_19_montgomery_64kb.mp3", "duration": 641}, {"section": 20, "title": "Ch 38", "readers": [18007], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/bluecastle_2406_librivox/bluecastle_20_montgomery_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1246}, {"section": 21, "title": "Ch 39 & 40", "readers": [18007], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/bluecastle_2406_librivox/bluecastle_21_montgomery_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1188}, {"section": 22, "title": "Ch 41 & 42", "readers": [18007], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/bluecastle_2406_librivox/bluecastle_22_montgomery_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1424}, {"section": 23, "title": "Ch 43-45", "readers": [18007], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/bluecastle_2406_librivox/bluecastle_23_montgomery_64kb.mp3", "duration": 425}]}
