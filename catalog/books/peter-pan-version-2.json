{"title": "Peter Pan (version 2)", "description": "In both the play and the novel, Peter often visits the \"real world\" of London to listen in on bedtime stories told by Mary Darling to her children. One night, Peter is spotted, and while trying to escape, he loses his shadow. On returning to claim his shadow, he wakes Mary's daughter, Wendy Darling. When Wendy succeeds in re-attaching his shadow to him, Peter takes a fancy to her and invites her to Neverland to be a mother to his gang of Lost Boys, the children who are lost in Kensington Gardens. Wendy agrees, and her brothers John and Michael go along. The dangerous and magical flight to Neverland is followed by many adventures. \n<BR><BR>\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_and_Wendy#Copyright_status\">Information about copyright status.</a>", "duration": 17441, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "1860", "name": "J.
