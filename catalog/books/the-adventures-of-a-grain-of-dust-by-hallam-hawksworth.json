{"title": "Adventures of a Grain of Dust", "description": "This charming book for children is full of interesting facts about all sorts of plants, insects, birds and animals and how they all help to enrich the soil for farmers - each in its own special way.  Join our narrator, The Grain of Dust on a fascinating journey around the planet to meet them. <br /><br /> \"I don't want you to think that I'm boasting, but I do believe I'm one of the greatest travellers that ever was; and if anybody, living or dead, has ever gone through with more than I have I'd like to hear about it. Not that I've personally been in all the places or taken part in all the things I tell in this book\u2014I don't mean to say that\u2014but I do ask you to remember how long it is possible for a grain of dust to last, and how many other far-travelled and much-adventured dust grains it must meet and mix with in the course of its life. ...Finally, if what we call flesh and blood can think and talk, why not a grain of dust? In fact, what is flesh and blood but dust come back to life? Says the poet\u2014and the poets know:\n<br /><br />\n'The very dust that blows along the street Once whispered to its love that life is sweet.'\n<br /><br />\nYou see it's as likely a thing as could happen\u2014this whole story.\" <br /><br />Summary by J.
