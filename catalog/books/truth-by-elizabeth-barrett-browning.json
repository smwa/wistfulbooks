{"title": "Truth", "description": "Elizabeth Barrett Browning was an English poet of the Victorian era, popular in Britain and the United States during her lifetime.\n\nElizabeth Barrett wrote poetry from about the age of six. Her mother's collection of her poems forms one of the largest extant collections of juvenilia by any English writer. At 15 she became ill, suffering intense head and spinal pain for the rest of her life. Later in life she also developed lung problems, possibly tuberculosis. She took laudanum for the pain from an early age, which is likely to have contributed to her frail health.
