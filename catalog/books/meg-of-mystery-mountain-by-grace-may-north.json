{"title": "Meg of Mystery Mountain", "description": "Jane Abbott, tall, graceful and languidly beautiful, passed through the bevy of girls on the wharf below Highacres Seminary with scarcely a nod for any of them. Closely following her came three other girls, each carrying a satchel and wearing a tailored gown of the latest cut. Although Esther Ballard and Barbara Morris called gaily to many of their friends, it was around Marion Starr that all of the girls crowded until her passage way to the small boat, even then getting up steam, was completely blocked. Jane, when she had crossed the gang plank, turned to find only Esther and Barbara at her side. A slight sneer curled her lips as she watched the adulation which Merry was receiving. Then, with a shrug of her slender shoulders that was more eloquent than words, the proud girl seated herself in one of the reclining deck chairs and imperiously motioned her friends to do likewise. \u201cIt\u2019s so silly of Merry to make such a fuss over all those girls. She\u2019ll miss the boat if she doesn\u2019t hurry.\u201d Marion had evidently thought of the same thing, for she laughingly ran up the gang plank, her arms filled with candy boxes, bouquets and magazines, gifts of her admiring friends. Depositing these on a chair, she leaned over the rail to call: \u201cGood-bye, girls! Of course I\u2019ll write to you, Sally, reams and reams; a sort of a round-robin letter to be sent to the whole crowd.\u201d (Summary by Grace May North)", "duration": 23212, "language": "English",
