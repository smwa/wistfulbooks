{"title": "Thralls of the Endless Night", "description": "This is a classic story from the early days of science fiction pulp magazines.  Leigh Brackett, a female author who stood with the best of them during the period, always has a quirky way of examining human behavior whether on earth or a distant planet.  A \"tribe\" composed of Hans, Officers and a Captain have been marooned on a strange place, out of touch with other humans for many generations.  They have to eke out a living with great difficulties in a difficult and hostile environment. Does this sound sort of familiar? There are also really neat 'Piruts' in the story who always try to get the supposed benefit of living close to the Ship.  I liked it and the ending is cool too.  - Summary by phil c", "duration": 5203, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "1359", "name": "Leigh Douglass Brackett"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/thrallsoftheendlessnight_2012_librivox/thralls_endless_night_2101.jpg", "copyright_year": "0", "genres": ["Science Fiction"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Linette Geisel"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Part 1", "readers": [5717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/thrallsoftheendlessnight_2012_librivox/thrallsoftheendlessnight_01_brackett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1424}, {"section": 2, "title": "Part 2", "readers": [5717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/thrallsoftheendlessnight_2012_librivox/thrallsoftheendlessnight_02_brackett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1318}, {"section": 3, "title": "Part 3", "readers": [5717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/thrallsoftheendlessnight_2012_librivox/thrallsoftheendlessnight_03_brackett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1517}, {"section": 4, "title": "Part 4", "readers": [5717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/thrallsoftheendlessnight_2012_librivox/thrallsoftheendlessnight_04_brackett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 944}]}
