{"title": "Old Ladies", "description": "\u201cQuite a number of years ago there was an old rickety building on the rock above Seatown in Polchester, and it was one of a number in an old grass-grown square known as Pontippy Square.  In this house at one time or another lived three old ladies,\u2026  It was a windy, creaky, rain-bitten dwelling-place for three old ladies\u2026.\u201d  (excerpt from the book)  During the mid 1920s Walpole produced two of his best-known novels in the macabre vein that he drew on from time to time, exploring the fascination of fear and cruelty. The Old Ladies (1924) is a study of a timid elderly spinster exploited and eventually frightened to death by a predatory widow.", "duration": 21507, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "3387", "name": "Hugh Walpole"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/librivoxcdcoverart36/oldladies_2001.jpg", "copyright_year": "1924", "genres": ["Crime & Mystery Fiction", "Published 1900 onward"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "David Wales"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "David Wales"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "DaveC"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "DaveC"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Mrs. Amorest Pays A Visit", "readers": [6454], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/the_old_ladies_2001_librivox/oldladies_01_walpole_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1756}, {"section": 2, "title": "Evening In The House - Agatha Payne", "readers": [6454], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/the_old_ladies_2001_librivox/oldladies_02_walpole_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1582}, {"section": 3, "title": "Life Of May Beringer", "readers": [6454], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/the_old_ladies_2001_librivox/oldladies_03_walpole_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1696}, {"section": 4, "title": "Red Amber", "readers": [6454], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/the_old_ladies_2001_librivox/oldladies_04_walpole_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2205}, {"section": 5, "title": "Christmas Eve", "readers": [6454], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/the_old_ladies_2001_librivox/oldladies_05_walpole_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2253}, {"section": 6, "title": "Agatha Secretly...", "readers": [6454], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/the_old_ladies_2001_librivox/oldladies_06_walpole_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1631}, {"section": 7, "title": "Death Of Hopes", "readers": [6454], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/the_old_ladies_2001_librivox/oldladies_07_walpole_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1667}, {"section": 8, "title": "May Beringer Tries To Escape", "readers": [6454], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/the_old_ladies_2001_librivox/oldladies_08_walpole_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1958}, {"section": 9, "title": "The Sense Of Danger", "readers": [6454], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/the_old_ladies_2001_librivox/oldladies_09_walpole_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1697}, {"section": 10, "title": "Death Of May Beringer", "readers": [6454], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/the_old_ladies_2001_librivox/oldladies_10_walpole_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1778}, {"section": 11, "title": "Mrs. Amorest Shows Courage", "readers": [6454], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/the_old_ladies_2001_librivox/oldladies_11_walpole_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1723}, {"section": 12, "title": "The House Is Abandoned", "readers": [6454], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/the_old_ladies_2001_librivox/oldladies_12_walpole_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1561}]}
