{"title": "Ursula", "description": "\u201cUrsula,\u201d first published in French in 1841 as \u201cUrsule Mirou\u00ebt,\u201d is part of Balzac\u2019s great suite of novels, collectively titled \u201cThe Human Comedy.\u201d \r\n\r\nA wealthy, elderly doctor has raised as his goddaughter a child who is the daughter of his deceased brother-in-law \u2014 a man who was himself illegitimate by birth. The doctor retires to a provincial town that is filled with his relatives by birth and inter-marriage. By French inheritance laws of the time, these relatives have a right to expect at least a share of the doctor\u2019s wealth upon his death. In contrast, the beloved goddaughter \u2014 who is legally not \u201crelated\u201d to him \u2014 has no automatic claim to inheritance. This sets up a situation in which the crass and materialistic relatives frantically try to lay hands on the whole of the doctor\u2019s inheritance.\r\n\r\nThere is also in the novel a strand of occult spiritualism. Balzac was fascinated by paranormal and mystical experience. Here we see evidence of his interest in Franz Mesmer\u2019s theories (\u201cmesmerism\u201d prefiguring the later science of hypnotism) and the ideas of the Swedish mystical theologian Emanuel Swedenborg. Modern readers \u2014 who may think of Balzac as one of the founders of realism in fiction \u2014 probably scoff at and discount the brief episodes of seances and occultism. In truth, however, Balzac\u2019s interest in these fields was shared by many European intellectuals and artists of his time. However improbable these elements may seem to us today, for Balzac, the spiritual and the material worlds were not contradictory exclusions, but realities that reach into each other\u2019s realms.\r\n\r\nBalzac himself considered this novel to be the very best that he had written up to this point in his career. - Summary by Bruce Pirie", "duration": 39175, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "86", "name": "Honor\u00e9 de Balzac"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/ursula_2409_librivox/ursula_2409.jpg", "copyright_year": "1891", "genres": ["Literary Fiction", "Published 1800 -1900"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Bruce Pirie"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Bruce Pirie"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "DaveC"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Winnifred Assmann"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "The frightened heirs", "readers": [3699], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ursula_2409_librivox/ursula_01_balzac_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2183}, {"section": 2, "title": "The rich uncle", "readers": [3699], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ursula_2409_librivox/ursula_02_balzac_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2037}, {"section": 3, "title": "The doctor's friends", "readers": [3699], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ursula_2409_librivox/ursula_03_balzac_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2008}, {"section": 4, "title": "Z\u00e9lie", "readers": [3699], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ursula_2409_librivox/ursula_04_balzac_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1758}, {"section": 5, "title": "Ursula", "readers": [3699], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ursula_2409_librivox/ursula_05_balzac_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1811}, {"section": 6, "title": "A treatise on mesmerism", "readers": [3699], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ursula_2409_librivox/ursula_06_balzac_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2520}, {"section": 7, "title": "A two-fold conversion", "readers": [3699], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ursula_2409_librivox/ursula_07_balzac_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1287}, {"section": 8, "title": "The conference", "readers": [3699], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ursula_2409_librivox/ursula_08_balzac_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1474}, {"section": 9, "title": "A first confidence", "readers": [3699], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ursula_2409_librivox/ursula_09_balzac_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1810}, {"section": 10, "title": "The family of Portendu\u00e8re", "readers": [3699], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ursula_2409_librivox/ursula_10_balzac_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1785}, {"section": 11, "title": "Savinien saved", "readers": [3699], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ursula_2409_librivox/ursula_11_balzac_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2340}, {"section": 12, "title": "Obstacles to young love", "readers": [3699], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ursula_2409_librivox/ursula_12_balzac_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1486}, {"section": 13, "title": "Betrothal of hearts", "readers": [3699], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ursula_2409_librivox/ursula_13_balzac_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2446}, {"section": 14, "title": "Ursula again orphaned", "readers": [3699], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ursula_2409_librivox/ursula_14_balzac_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1351}, {"section": 15, "title": "The doctor's will", "readers": [3699], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ursula_2409_librivox/ursula_15_balzac_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2315}, {"section": 16, "title": "The two adversaries", "readers": [3699], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ursula_2409_librivox/ursula_16_balzac_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1288}, {"section": 17, "title": "The malignity of provincial minds", "readers": [3699], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ursula_2409_librivox/ursula_17_balzac_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2168}, {"section": 18, "title": "A two-fold vengeance", "readers": [3699], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ursula_2409_librivox/ursula_18_balzac_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1915}, {"section": 19, "title": "Apparitions", "readers": [3699], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ursula_2409_librivox/ursula_19_balzac_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2428}, {"section": 20, "title": "Remorse", "readers": [3699], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ursula_2409_librivox/ursula_20_balzac_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1144}, {"section": 21, "title": "Showing how difficult it is to steal that which seems very easily stolen", "readers": [3699], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ursula_2409_librivox/ursula_21_balzac_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1621}]}
