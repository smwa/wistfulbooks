{"title": "How the Codex Was Found", "description": "\"The narrative of these two journeys is of special interest, because the first one, that made by my twin sister, Mrs. Lewis, and myself, in 1892, led to the discovery of an early and important codex of ancient Syriac gospels... while that made by us this year in company with [more Cambridge scholars and their wives] was undertaken for the purpose of deciphering the precious manuscript to which we have alluded.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\"Abler pens than mine will write about these Syriac gospels... yet on me devolves the task of telling how the codex was found. Many inaccurate statements have been made by too hasty writers in our public prints, and it has occurred to me that the best means of removing misconceptions on the subject is to reprint my sister's journal of our trips to Sinai in 1892 and 1893.\" - Margaret Dunlop Gibson ", "duration": 8868, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "16172", "name": "Margaret Dunlop Gibson"}, {"id": "13831", "name": "Agnes Smith Lewis"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/howthecodexwasfound_2112_librivox/howcodexwasfound_2112.jpg", "copyright_year": "1893", "genres": ["Christianity - Other", "Exploration"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Hannah Mary"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Hannah Mary"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Devorah Allen"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Larry Wilson"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "First Visit to Sinai - Part 1", "readers": [10594], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/howthecodexwasfound_2112_librivox/howthecodexwasfound_01_gibson_64kb.mp3", "duration": 346}, {"section": 2, "title": "First Visit to Sinai - Part 2", "readers": [10594], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/howthecodexwasfound_2112_librivox/howthecodexwasfound_02_gibson_64kb.mp3", "duration": 474}, {"section": 3, "title": "First Visit to Sinai - Part 3", "readers": [10594], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/howthecodexwasfound_2112_librivox/howthecodexwasfound_03_gibson_64kb.mp3", "duration": 763}, {"section": 4, "title": "First Visit to Sinai - Part 4", "readers": [10594], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/howthecodexwasfound_2112_librivox/howthecodexwasfound_04_gibson_64kb.mp3", "duration": 636}, {"section": 5, "title": "First Visit to Sinai - Part 5", "readers": [10594], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/howthecodexwasfound_2112_librivox/howthecodexwasfound_05_gibson_64kb.mp3", "duration": 768}, {"section": 6, "title": "First Visit to Sinai - Part 6", "readers": [10594], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/howthecodexwasfound_2112_librivox/howthecodexwasfound_06_gibson_64kb.mp3", "duration": 997}, {"section": 7, "title": "Identification of the Codex", "readers": [10594], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/howthecodexwasfound_2112_librivox/howthecodexwasfound_07_gibson_64kb.mp3", "duration": 718}, {"section": 8, "title": "A Greek Description of Sinai - Part 1", "readers": [10594], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/howthecodexwasfound_2112_librivox/howthecodexwasfound_08_gibson_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1394}, {"section": 9, "title": "A Greek Description of Sinai - Part 2", "readers": [10594], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/howthecodexwasfound_2112_librivox/howthecodexwasfound_09_gibson_64kb.mp3", "duration": 662}, {"section": 10, "title": "St. Sylvia of Aquitaine", "readers": [10594], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/howthecodexwasfound_2112_librivox/howthecodexwasfound_10_gibson_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1132}, {"section": 11, "title": "Second Visit to Sinai", "readers": [10594], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/howthecodexwasfound_2112_librivox/howthecodexwasfound_11_gibson_64kb.mp3", "duration": 978}]}
