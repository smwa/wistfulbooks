{"title": "Lonesome Land", "description": "Val had come to Montana to marry a cowboy named Manley, envisioning a life of wedded bliss, freedom, and was anticipating happiness in her adopted part of the country.  She would soon learn that the winters could be cruel and lonesome for a woman living on a ranch which was situated miles from the nearest neighbor.  She would learn that her husband spent most of his time drinking.  And she would learn that everybody has their own methods of dealing with the harshness and loneliness of the land she has come to call home.  Val is determined to re-invent her notions about men and women, her new duties in life, and life as it existed in the relatively new West.  At every turn, her will and her strength are tested.  Would she find the strength within herself to overcome the hardships, or would she succumb to the reality of her surroundings?    - Summary by Roger Melin", "duration": 31233, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "1778", "name": "B.
