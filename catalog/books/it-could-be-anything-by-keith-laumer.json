{"title": "It Could Be Anything", "description": "A science fiction story by the great Keith Laumer - what more needs to be said?  -  But I will say more nevertheless.  A young man sets out from his rural town to see the world for himself.  What is really over the next hill?  What does a big city look like? Is there really an ocean?  After all, we only have the testimony of others that tell us about these things.   Full confidence and belief in himself, he boards the local train, falls asleep and then ..... finds himself alone, the three cars abandoned .... the engine is gone and the tracks; well, the tracks just end in the middle of a grain field.  What is going on?  What kind of reality is this?   Or is what we 'know' just illusions and in fact, It Could Be Anything!!!
