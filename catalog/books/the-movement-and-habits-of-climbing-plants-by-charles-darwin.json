{"title": "Movement and Habits of Climbing Plants", "description": "A technical report of the experiments and observations performed on various species of twining, tendril-climbing, root-climbing, and leaf-climbing plants, with some review of past literature and an emphasis on taking measurements to allow the quantitative comparison of sensitivity and speed of reactions across different genera and species. Conclusions and hypotheses on the fitness advantages, progressive adaptations, and evolutionary relatedness of different species are included.", "duration": 21241, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "166", "name": "Charles Darwin"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/climbing_plants_2112_librivox/habits_climbing_plants_2201.jpg", "copyright_year": "1906", "genres": ["Earth Sciences"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "allegro200Hz"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "allegro200Hz"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Lynne T"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Chapter 1", "readers": [16632], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/climbing_plants_2112_librivox/climbingplants_01_darwin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 4696}, {"section": 2, "title": "Chapter 2", "readers": [16632], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/climbing_plants_2112_librivox/climbingplants_02_darwin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 5331}, {"section": 3, "title": "Chapter 3", "readers": [16632], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/climbing_plants_2112_librivox/climbingplants_03_darwin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3837}, {"section": 4, "title": "Chapter 4", "readers": [16632], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/climbing_plants_2112_librivox/climbingplants_04_darwin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 5149}, {"section": 5, "title": "Chapter 5", "readers": [16632], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/climbing_plants_2112_librivox/climbingplants_05_darwin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2228}]}
