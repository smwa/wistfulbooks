{"title": "Venus Boy", "description": "If you ever make a trip to the green planet of Venus, the first thing you'll see will be the fifty-foot high statue of Venus' greatest hero. It stands on the very top of towering New Plymouth Rock at the edge of the old colony of New Plymouth. Even from the rocket cradle, anyone can tell that the statue is of a twelve-year-old boy smiling up at the Venusian jewel bear perched on his shoulder. Cut into the huge rock below the statue are the words,\n<br><br>\n\"Virgil Dare (Johnny) Watson\nAnd the Marva, Baba.\nMay their Friendship Endure!\"\n<br><br>\nVirgil Dare Watson, called Johnny by his friends, was the first human being born on Venus. He was named after Virginia Dare, the first pioneer child born in North America, and for a long time he was the only child on all Venus. And that would have been a lonely thing to be if it had not been for Baba. Baba, the bear, was not only Johnny's pet, but his best friend, too, and the only one who knew about his three secrets.\n<br><br>\nBecause of these secrets, Johnny got himself, his jewel bear, Baba, and the whole colony of New Plymouth into desperate trouble. And because of these secrets, he also became a hero worthy of a statue\u2014Venus' greatest hero. - Summary by Preface", "duration": 21012, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "13557", "name": "Lee Sutton"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/venus_boy_rb_1809_librivox/venusboy_1809.jpg", "copyright_year": "1955", "genres": ["Science Fiction"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Shasta"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Ann Boulais"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Ann Boulais"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Ann Boulais"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Introduction", "readers": [11555], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/venus_boy_rb_1809_librivox/venusboy_00_sutton_64kb.mp3", "duration": 168}, {"section": 1, "title": "The First Two Secrets", "readers": [11555], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/venus_boy_rb_1809_librivox/venusboy_01_sutton_64kb.mp3", "duration": 966}, {"section": 2, "title": "The Treasure of Venus", "readers": [11555], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/venus_boy_rb_1809_librivox/venusboy_02_sutton_64kb.mp3", "duration": 970}, {"section": 3, "title": "A Dangerous Target", "readers": [11555], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/venus_boy_rb_1809_librivox/venusboy_03_sutton_64kb.mp3", "duration": 900}, {"section": 4, "title": "The Third Secret", "readers": [11555], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/venus_boy_rb_1809_librivox/venusboy_04_sutton_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1071}, {"section": 5, "title": "A Mystery Indeed!", "readers": [11555], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/venus_boy_rb_1809_librivox/venusboy_05_sutton_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1368}, {"section": 6, "title": "Inside New Plymouth", "readers": [11555], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/venus_boy_rb_1809_librivox/venusboy_06_sutton_64kb.mp3", "duration": 900}, {"section": 7, "title": "The Rhinosaur Stampede", "readers": [11555], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/venus_boy_rb_1809_librivox/venusboy_07_sutton_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1283}, {"section": 8, "title": "One Secret is Revealed!", "readers": [11555], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/venus_boy_rb_1809_librivox/venusboy_08_sutton_64kb.mp3", "duration": 551}, {"section": 9, "title": "The Price of a Brother", "readers": [11555], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/venus_boy_rb_1809_librivox/venusboy_09_sutton_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1179}, {"section": 10, "title": "Alone in the Jungle", "readers": [11555], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/venus_boy_rb_1809_librivox/venusboy_10_sutton_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1948}, {"section": 11, "title": "The Friends are Separated", "readers": [11555], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/venus_boy_rb_1809_librivox/venusboy_11_sutton_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1075}, {"section": 12, "title": "The Price of a Boy", "readers": [11555], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/venus_boy_rb_1809_librivox/venusboy_12_sutton_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1016}, {"section": 13, "title": "Outwitting the Outlaws", "readers": [11555], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/venus_boy_rb_1809_librivox/venusboy_13_sutton_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1434}, {"section": 14, "title": "Captured!", "readers": [11555], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/venus_boy_rb_1809_librivox/venusboy_14_sutton_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1221}, {"section": 15, "title": "A City in the Trees", "readers": [11555], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/venus_boy_rb_1809_librivox/venusboy_15_sutton_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1751}, {"section": 16, "title": "The Thunder of Rhinosaur Hooves", "readers": [11555], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/venus_boy_rb_1809_librivox/venusboy_16_sutton_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1953}, {"section": 17, "title": "Teachers Can't Play Hookie", "readers": [11555], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/venus_boy_rb_1809_librivox/venusboy_17_sutton_64kb.mp3", "duration": 671}, {"section": 18, "title": "Facts About Venus", "readers": [11555], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/venus_boy_rb_1809_librivox/venusboy_18_sutton_64kb.mp3", "duration": 587}]}
