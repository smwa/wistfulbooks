{"title": "Spirit of the Cure\u0301 of Ars", "description": "St. Jean-Baptiste Marie Vianney (known in English as St. John Vianney), was a French priest that lived from 1786-1859. He would later become famous as the Cur\u00e9 of Ars. Despite notoriously little formal education, he inspired an untold number to convert to the Catholic Faith, through the way that he spoke both passionately and simply, and the way that he lived his life.  This book presents some of his catechisms, sermons, exhortations, and thoughts. It offers some of the most passionate pleas to the faithful, allowing him to inspire another generation from beyond the grave. - Summary by Sarah Cain", "duration": 22572, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "17655", "name": "Alfred Monnin"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/spirit_cure_ars_sc_2306_librivox/spirit_cure_ars_2306.jpg", "copyright_year": "1865", "genres": ["Philosophy", "Early Modern", "Christianity - Commentary"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Sarah Cain"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Sarah Cain"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Ann Boulais"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Ann Boulais"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Preface", "readers": [18619], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/spirit_cure_ars_sc_2306_librivox/spiritofthecureofars_00_monnin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 309}, {"section": 1, "title": "The Cure of Ars in His Catechisms", "readers": [18619], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/spirit_cure_ars_sc_2306_librivox/spiritofthecureofars_01_monnin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2762}, {"section": 2, "title": "Catechisms 1-10", "readers": [18619], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/spirit_cure_ars_sc_2306_librivox/spiritofthecureofars_02_monnin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3203}, {"section": 3, "title": "Catechisms 11-21", "readers": [18619], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/spirit_cure_ars_sc_2306_librivox/spiritofthecureofars_03_monnin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3589}, {"section": 4, "title": "The Cure of Ars in His Homilies", "readers": [18619], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/spirit_cure_ars_sc_2306_librivox/spiritofthecureofars_04_monnin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2228}, {"section": 5, "title": "The Cure of Ars in His Conversation", "readers": [18619], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/spirit_cure_ars_sc_2306_librivox/spiritofthecureofars_05_monnin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1889}, {"section": 6, "title": "Characteristics of John Vianney", "readers": [18619], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/spirit_cure_ars_sc_2306_librivox/spiritofthecureofars_06_monnin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3286}, {"section": 7, "title": "17 Exhortations: 1-9", "readers": [18619], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/spirit_cure_ars_sc_2306_librivox/spiritofthecureofars_07_monnin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2447}, {"section": 8, "title": "17 Exhortations: 10-17", "readers": [18619], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/spirit_cure_ars_sc_2306_librivox/spiritofthecureofars_08_monnin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2859}]}
