{"title": "Early History of the Airplane", "description": "The Brothers Orville and Wilbur Wright made the first controlled, powered and sustained heavier-than-air flight, on 17th December 1903. They were not the first to build and fly aircraft, but they invented the controls that were necessary for a pilot to steer the aircraft, which made fixed wing powered flight possible. The Early History of the Airplane consists of three short essays about the beginnings of human flight. The second essay retells the first flight: <em>This flight lasted only 12 seconds, but it was nevertheless the first in the history of the world in which a machine carrying a man had raised itself by its own power into the air in full flight, had sailed forward without reduction of speed and had finally landed at a point as high as that from which it started.</em> (Introduction by Availle)", "duration": 5592, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "682", "name": "Orville Wright"}, {"id": "683", "name": "Wilbur Wright"}], "coverArt": "https://www.archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt/early_history_airplane_1003.jpg", "copyright_year": "1922", "genres": ["Essays & Short Works", "Technology & Engineering", "Memoirs"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Availle"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Availle"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Barry Eads"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Neeru Iyer"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "The Wright Brother's Aeroplane", "readers": [4174], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/early_history_airplane_1003_librivox/earlyhistoryairplane_1_wright_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1981}, {"section": 2, "title": "How We Made the First Flight", "readers": [4174], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/early_history_airplane_1003_librivox/earlyhistoryairplane_2_wright_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1567}, {"section": 3, "title": "Some Aeronautical Experiments", "readers": [4174], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/early_history_airplane_1003_librivox/earlyhistoryairplane_3_wright_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2044}]}
