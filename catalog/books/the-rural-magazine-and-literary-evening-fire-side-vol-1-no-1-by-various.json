{"title": "Rural Magazine and Literary Evening Fire-Side Vol 1 No 1", "description": "This is the first issue of a monthly agricultural magazine for the year 1820.  From the introduction: \"A leading object of the Rural Magazine will be to furnish correct views of the science of Agriculture, and the various improvements which are daily made or suggested in it. For this purpose the best and most recent European works on the subject will be consulted, and selections made from the American newspapers that are devoted or friendly to the cause. The best information on the subject will thus be condensed in a form less unwieldy than a newspaper, and more popular than in scientific books. We also expect original papers from our agricultural friends, being confident that there is much in the farming of our neighbouring counties, well worthy of being widely known and imitated.\" - Summary by Magazine Editors", "duration": 9543, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "18", "name": " Various"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/ruralmagazinevol1no1_2007_librivox/rural_magazine1_2007.jpg", "copyright_year": "1820", "genres": ["Earth Sciences"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Larry Wilson"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "TriciaG"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Rapunzelina"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Introduction", "readers": [8425], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ruralmagazinevol1no1_2007_librivox/ruralmagazinevol1no1_01_various_64kb.mp3", "duration": 346}, {"section": 2, "title": "To the Editors", "readers": [14045], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ruralmagazinevol1no1_2007_librivox/ruralmagazinevol1no1_02_various_64kb.mp3", "duration": 477}, {"section": 3, "title": "Letters of a Citizen to his Friends in the Country No. 1", "readers": [14308], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ruralmagazinevol1no1_2007_librivox/ruralmagazinevol1no1_03_various_64kb.mp3", "duration": 363}, {"section": 4, "title": "Extension of Slavery", "readers": [13661], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ruralmagazinevol1no1_2007_librivox/ruralmagazinevol1no1_04_various_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1100}, {"section": 5, "title": "Familiar Letters: From an Englishman in this Country to His Friend at Home", "readers": [9642], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ruralmagazinevol1no1_2007_librivox/ruralmagazinevol1no1_05_various_64kb.mp3", "duration": 450}, {"section": 6, "title": "Treatise on Agriculture.Section 1.On the Rise and Progress of Agriculture.", "readers": [11715], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ruralmagazinevol1no1_2007_librivox/ruralmagazinevol1no1_06_various_64kb.mp3", "duration": 380}, {"section": 7, "title": "The Moral Plough Boy", "readers": [8425], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ruralmagazinevol1no1_2007_librivox/ruralmagazinevol1no1_07_various_64kb.mp3", "duration": 380}, {"section": 8, "title": "Mr. Nicholson's Prize Essay", "readers": [10261], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ruralmagazinevol1no1_2007_librivox/ruralmagazinevol1no1_08_various_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1581}, {"section": 9, "title": "Cotton, Rice, Tobacco, Sugar, Wine", "readers": [10261], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ruralmagazinevol1no1_2007_librivox/ruralmagazinevol1no1_09_various_64kb.mp3", "duration": 442}, {"section": 10, "title": "Notes and Remarks - By the Editor of the Register", "readers": [14190], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ruralmagazinevol1no1_2007_librivox/ruralmagazinevol1no1_10_various_64kb.mp3", "duration": 549}, {"section": 11, "title": "Vine Dressing near Vevay/Political Economics", "readers": [13278], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ruralmagazinevol1no1_2007_librivox/ruralmagazinevol1no1_11_various_64kb.mp3", "duration": 433}, {"section": 12, "title": "From Humboldt's Personal Narrative .", "readers": [10244], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ruralmagazinevol1no1_2007_librivox/ruralmagazinevol1no1_12_various_64kb.mp3", "duration": 541}, {"section": 13, "title": "Singular effect of Peruvian Bark/Oil of Pumpkin Seed", "readers": [13278], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ruralmagazinevol1no1_2007_librivox/ruralmagazinevol1no1_13_various_64kb.mp3", "duration": 297}, {"section": 14, "title": "Disease among Horses - The Arabian Horse", "readers": [11715], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ruralmagazinevol1no1_2007_librivox/ruralmagazinevol1no1_14_various_64kb.mp3", "duration": 416}, {"section": 15, "title": "James Watt", "readers": [14190], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ruralmagazinevol1no1_2007_librivox/ruralmagazinevol1no1_15_various_64kb.mp3", "duration": 990}, {"section": 16, "title": "Light without Heat or Combustion/Whale Fisheries", "readers": [10244], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ruralmagazinevol1no1_2007_librivox/ruralmagazinevol1no1_16_various_64kb.mp3", "duration": 297}, {"section": 17, "title": "Fire-Places", "readers": [8425], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ruralmagazinevol1no1_2007_librivox/ruralmagazinevol1no1_17_various_64kb.mp3", "duration": 501}]}
