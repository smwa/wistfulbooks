{"title": "My Lady of the Chinese Courtyard", "description": "\"I hope that this book, based on letters shown me many years after they were written, will give a faint idea of the life of a Chinese lady.  The story is told in two series of letters conceived to be written by Kwei-li, the wife of a very high Chinese official, [the first series were written] to her husband when he accompanied his master, Prince Chung, on his trip around the world.\"  The second series of letters were written 25 years later to Kwei-li's mother-in-law as China faces revolution and political intrigue.  \"They are, therefore, the letters of the present-day Chinese woman of the old school, a woman who had by education and environment exceptional opportunities to learn of the modern world, but who, like every Eastern woman, clings with almost desperate tenacity to the traditions and customs of her race.\"  (Summary by MaryAnn with material from the Preface)", "duration": 18138, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "11750", "name": "Elizabeth Cooper"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/librivoxcdcoverart34/mylady_1602.jpg", "copyright_year": "0", "genres": ["Epistolary Fiction", "Family Life"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "MaryAnn"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "MaryAnn"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "MaryAnn"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Availle"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Author's Note and Preface", "readers": [3645], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/mylady_1602_librivox/mylady_00_cooper_64kb.mp3", "duration": 439}, {"section": 1, "title": "Part 1 Letters 1 - 5", "readers": [3645], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/mylady_1602_librivox/mylady_01_cooper_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1121}, {"section": 2, "title": "Part 1 Letters 6 - 10", "readers": [3645], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/mylady_1602_librivox/mylady_02_cooper_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1449}, {"section": 3, "title": "Part 1 Letters 11 - 16", "readers": [3645], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/mylady_1602_librivox/mylady_03_cooper_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1370}, {"section": 4, "title": "Part 1 Letters 17 - 25", "readers": [3645], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/mylady_1602_librivox/mylady_04_cooper_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1025}, {"section": 5, "title": "Part 1 Letters 26 - 39", "readers": [3645], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/mylady_1602_librivox/mylady_05_cooper_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1251}, {"section": 6, "title": "Part 2 Preface and Letters 1 - 2", "readers": [3645], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/mylady_1602_librivox/mylady_06_cooper_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1315}, {"section": 7, "title": "Part 2 Letters 3 - 5", "readers": [3645], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/mylady_1602_librivox/mylady_07_cooper_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1621}, {"section": 8, "title": "Part 2 Letters 6 - 9", "readers": [3645], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/mylady_1602_librivox/mylady_08_cooper_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1799}, {"section": 9, "title": "Part 2 Letters 10 - 11", "readers": [3645], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/mylady_1602_librivox/mylady_09_cooper_64kb.mp3", "duration": 896}, {"section": 10, "title": "Part 2 Letters 12 - 13", "readers": [3645], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/mylady_1602_librivox/mylady_10_cooper_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1138}, {"section": 11, "title": "Part 2 Letters 14 - 15", "readers": [3645], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/mylady_1602_librivox/mylady_11_cooper_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1177}, {"section": 12, "title": "Part 2 Letters 16 - 17", "readers": [3645], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/mylady_1602_librivox/mylady_12_cooper_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1061}, {"section": 13, "title": "Part 2 Letters 18 - 20", "readers": [3645], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/mylady_1602_librivox/mylady_13_cooper_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1079}, {"section": 14, "title": "Part 2 Letters 21 - 32", "readers": [3645], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/mylady_1602_librivox/mylady_14_cooper_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1397}]}
