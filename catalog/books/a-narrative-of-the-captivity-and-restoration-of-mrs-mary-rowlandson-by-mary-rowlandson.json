{"title": "Narrative of the Captivity and Restoration of Mrs. Mary Rowlandson", "description": "This is the story of Mary Rowlandson\u2019s capture by American Indians in 1675. It is a blunt, frightening, and detailed work with several moments of off-color humor. Mary, the wife of a minister, was captured by Natives during King Philip's War while living in a Lancaster town, most of which was decimated, and the people murdered. See through her eyes, which depict Indians as the instruments of Satan. Her accounts were a best-seller of the era, and a seminal work, being one of the first captivity narratives ever published by a woman. Without works such as hers, there would likely not be many modern works inspired by similar themes, such as The Searchers, starring John Wayne.(Summary by Matthew Scott Surprenant)", "duration": 6731, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "158", "name": "Mary White Rowlandson"}], "coverArt": "https://www.archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt/Narrative_of_the_Captivity_and_Restoration_of_Mrs_Mary_Rowlandson_1002.jpg", "copyright_year": "1682", "genres": ["*Non-fiction", "History", "Memoirs"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Matthew Scott Surprenant"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Matthew Scott Surprenant"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Annise"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "mim@can (1949-2017)"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "01 - part 1", "readers": [4406], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/captivity_restoration_rowlandson_0912_librivox/captivity_01_rowlandson_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1840}, {"section": 2, "title": "02 - part 2", "readers": [4406], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/captivity_restoration_rowlandson_0912_librivox/captivity_02_rowlandson_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2327}, {"section": 3, "title": "03 - part 3", "readers": [4406], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/captivity_restoration_rowlandson_0912_librivox/captivity_03_rowlandson_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2564}]}
