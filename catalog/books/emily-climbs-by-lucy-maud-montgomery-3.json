{"title": "Emily Climbs, Version 3", "description": "Teenage orphan Emily Starr of New Moon has always wanted to be a great writer. But her old-fashioned aunt, who has never liked Emily\u2019s writing, refuses to let Emily go to high school unless she stops! Shrewsbury brings new friends, new adventures, and new enemies, and the town is scandalized by some of Emily\u2019s exploits. Perhaps the hardest trial is having to board with her Aunt Ruth. Or is it her promise to Aunt Elizabeth? But Emily\u2019s troubles are only the beginning of her climb to success \u2026 and perhaps romance. - Summary by Rachel\r\nThis recording was originally published on Legamus.eu and was later released
