{"title": "Treaty with China", "description": "\"A good candidate for 'the most under-appreciated work by Mark Twain' would be 'The Treaty With China,' which he published in the New York Tribune in 1868. This piece, which is an early statement of Twain's opposition to imperialism and which conveys his vision of how the U.S. ought to behave on the global stage, has not been reprinted since its original publication until now.\" (the online, open-access \"Journal of Transnational American Studies\" published it in the spring, 2010).
