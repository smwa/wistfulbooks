{"title": "Love and Freindship (Dramatic Reading)", "description": "Love and Freindship [sic] is a melodramatic epistolary novelette written by Jane Austen when she was fourteen years old. Although the novels Austen became known for were not published until she was in her thirties, she was an active writer from the age of twelve, frequently composing epistolary works such as Love and Freindship. Austen eventually compiled 29 of her early writings in three notebooks that became known as the Juvenilia and that she called \u201cVolume the First\u201d, \u201cVolume the Second\u201d, and \u201cVolume the Third\u201d, including Love and Freindship in \u201cVolume the Second\u201d.\r\n\r\nLove and Freindship is set contemporaneously to Austen\u2019s writing and consists of a series of fifteen letters, most of which are written from the perspective of the protagonist, Laura, who recounts her extraordinary personal history to her friend Isabel\u2019s daughter. The novel satirizes sentimental novels, which were a popular genre at the time. Austen\u2019s early works are frequently published with the original spelling errors unaltered, a practice that is particularly conspicuous in the case of Love and Freindship because of the spelling error in the title. Austen dedicated this novelette to her cousin Eliza de Feuillide, who is believed by literary critics to have inspired multiple characters in Austen\u2019s writings, including the titular character in the novel Lady Susan. In 2016, Lady Susan was adapted into a film that borrowed the title Love & Friendship, albeit with the spelling corrected. - Summary by David Purdy\r\n<BR><BR>Cast List:<BR><BR>\r\nLaura: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/17841\">Irene Rubio</a><br>\r\nSophia: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/11084\">Devorah Allen</a><br>\r\nEdward Lindsay: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/8425\">Larry Wilson</a><br>\r\nIsabel: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/17928\">rosefiasco</a><br>\r\nAugusta: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/13140\">Jenn Broda</a><br>\r\nGustavus: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/10789\">Tomas Peter</a><br>\r\nPolydore: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/10542\">David Purdy</a><br>\r\nClaudia: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/15644\">Michelle Purdy</a><br>\r\nSir Edward: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/13577\">Adrian Stephens</a><br>\r\nAugustus: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/17752\">redrun</a><br>\r\nPhilippa: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/18293\">Norah Nelson</a><br>\r\nLord St. Clair: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/4705\">Algy Pug</a><br>\r\nJanetta: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/17923\">deaspoke</a><br>\r\nMacDonald: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/6754\">ToddHW</a><br>\r\nServant: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/8011\">Greg Giordano</a><br>\r\nPostilion: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/11395\">Rich Brown</a><br>\r\nInnkeeper: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/15042\">John Payton</a><br>\r\nNarrator: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/16205\">James R.
