{"title": "Mendelssohn And Certain Masterworks", "description": "In the compass of the present pamphlet it is impossible to give more than a cursory survey of Mendelssohn\u2019s happy but extraordinarily crowded life. He was only slightly less prolific a composer than such masters as Bach, Mozart or Schubert, even if he did not reach the altitude of their supreme heights.
