{"title": "Hope and Have; Fanny Grant Among the Indians", "description": "The fifth volume of the Woodville stories contains the experience of Fanny Grant, who from a very naughty girl became a very good one, by the influence of a pure and beautiful example. The story is not an illustration of the \"pleasures of hope;\" but an attempt to show the young reader that what we most desire, in moral and spiritual, as well as worldly things, we labor the hardest to obtain\u2014a truism adopted by the heroine in the form of the principal title of the volume, Hope and Have.  Previous book in the series is Noddy Newman on a Cruise.  The 6th and final book of the series is Haste and Waste. - Summary by Scarlett Martin from book preface<br /><br />\n<b>Woodville Series:</b><br />\n<a href=\"https://librivox.org/rich-and-humble-by-william-taylor-adams/\" target=\"_blank\">Rich and Humble;
