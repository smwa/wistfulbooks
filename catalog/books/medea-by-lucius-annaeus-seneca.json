{"title": "Medea (Version 2)", "description": "Medea is a fabula crepidata (Roman play with Greek subject) of about 1000 lines of verse written by Seneca the Younger. It was written around 50 CE and is generally considered to be the strongest of his plays.\r\n<BR><BR>\r\nThe play details the vengeance of Medea against her betraying husband Jason by killing his children and also against King Creon for arranging Jason's marriage to his own daughter. Medea herself speaks more than half the lines in the play. The play addresses many themes, one being that the title character represents redress for human transgression of natural laws, she is sent by the Gods to punish Jason for his sins. Another theme is her powerful voice which cannot be silenced, even by King Creon.\r\n - Summary by Alan Mapstone\r\n<BR><BR>Cast list for Medea<BR><BR>\r\n\r\nMedea: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/15373\">WendyKatzHiller</a><br>\r\nJason: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/6754\">ToddHW</a><br>\r\nCreon: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/18171\">Mathias Thorndal</a><br>\r\nNurse: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/13257\">Elsie Selwyn</a><br>\r\nMessenger: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/12623\">Stefan Von Blon</a><br>\r\nChorus of Corinthian Women: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/10179\">Sonia</a><br>\r\nStage Directions: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/7170\">Alan Mapstone</a><br>", "duration": 4439, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "257", "name": "Lucius Annaeus Seneca"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/medea_2303_librivox/Medea_2303.jpg", "copyright_year": "1899", "genres": ["Plays"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Alan Mapstone"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "ToddHW"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Alan Mapstone"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Act 1", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/medea_2303_librivox/medea_1_seneca_64kb.mp3", "duration": 546}, {"section": 2, "title": "Act 2", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/medea_2303_librivox/medea_2_seneca_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1047}, {"section": 3, "title": "Act 3", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/medea_2303_librivox/medea_3_seneca_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1237}, {"section": 4, "title": "Act 4", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/medea_2303_librivox/medea_4_seneca_64kb.mp3", "duration": 790}, {"section": 5, "title": "Act 5", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/medea_2303_librivox/medea_5_seneca_64kb.mp3", "duration": 819}]}
