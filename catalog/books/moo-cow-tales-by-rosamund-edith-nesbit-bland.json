{"title": "Moo Cow Tales", "description": "Moo Cow Tales is a collection of four children's short stories written during the 1890's by young author Rosamund Edith Nesbit Bland. In 1904, Rosamund co-authored another book of children's stories, Cat Tales, with her adoptive mother, Edith Nesbit. Rosamund Edith Nesbit Bland also wrote the 1934 novel, The Man in the Stone House, about a young woman's relationship with her parents. Each story in Moo Cow Tale uses the literary device of personification. The book from which this recording is made has many fine illustrations by Evelyn Stuart Hardy (1866-1935), an artist whose work graced so many publications including children's books that featured pop-ups and moveable pictures.\r\n(Summary by Brian Fullen)", "duration": 1893, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "17339", "name": "Rosamund Edith Nesbit Bland"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/moo_cow_tales_2301_librivox/moocow_tales_2301.jpg", "copyright_year": "1899", "genres": ["Genre(s):"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Brian Fullen"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Amy Gramour"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Laurie Banza"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "THE LITTLE BULL-CALF AND THE POPPY", "readers": [18132], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/moo_cow_tales_2301_librivox/moocowtales_01_bland_64kb.mp3", "duration": 437}, {"section": 2, "title": "THE SACRED BULL", "readers": [18051], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/moo_cow_tales_2301_librivox/moocowtales_02_bland_64kb.mp3", "duration": 530}, {"section": 3, "title": "OUR COW'S COW FIGHT", "readers": [4570], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/moo_cow_tales_2301_librivox/moocowtales_03_bland_64kb.mp3", "duration": 534}, {"section": 4, "title": "PANSY'S FORTUNE", "readers": [17662], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/moo_cow_tales_2301_librivox/moocowtales_04_bland_64kb.mp3", "duration": 392}]}
