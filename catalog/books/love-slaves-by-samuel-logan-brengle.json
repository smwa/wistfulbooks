{"title": "Love Slaves", "description": "Samuel Logan Brengle was a commissioner in the Salvation Army. His books are known for the practicality, joyfulness and authenticity. His life was spent working with people on the streets, so his insights into the work of the Holy Spirit are relevant to everyday life. His holiness was that of the street, the kitchen, and everyday life. His stories are of men and women living their daily lives. In this book, Brengle explores how to live the Christian life so that we are walking in the centre of God's Will and daily showing His Love to the world around us. From the Preface by General Bramwell Booth: Here are words to clear the thought, as well as to guide the Will and strengthen the Heart.
