Our hero, Ben Bailey, shows that true worth comes from richness of character. Though a grocer's assistant in the small town of Rivermouth, Ben befriends an older gentleman who seemingly has little to offer, but becomes the source of a successful life to Ben. Ben shows his courage in physical and financial danger and reaps the benefits of the opportunities that come his way.
