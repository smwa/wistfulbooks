{"title": "Second Home", "description": "This novella was first published in French in 1830, with the title \u201cLa femme vertueuse\u201d (\u201cThe virtuous woman\u201d). In an 1842 edition, the title was changed to \u201cUne double famille\u201d (\u201cA double family\u201d).\r\n<br><br>\r\nFor Balzac, success in marital relations depended on partners being well matched both in temperament and in social class. In this story, a young lawyer marries a childhood friend, only to discover too late that she has become narrow-mindedly religious. She is described as a \u201cbigot.\u201d (In French, the word specifically suggests religious prudery more than it does in English.) To escape the sanctimonious chill of this marital home, the lawyer sets up an impoverished seamstress as his mistress. The story explores the plight of women and the pathology of marriage. - Summary by Bruce Pirie", "duration": 12133, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "86", "name": "Honor\u00e9 de Balzac"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/secondhome_2505_librivox/second_home_2505.jpg", "copyright_year": "1897", "genres": ["Literary Fiction", "Published 1800 -1900"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Bruce Pirie"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Bruce Pirie"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Ann Boulais"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Winnifred Assmann"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Section 1", "readers": [3699], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/secondhome_2505_librivox/secondhome_01_balzac_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3096}, {"section": 2, "title": "Section 2", "readers": [3699], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/secondhome_2505_librivox/secondhome_02_balzac_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2212}, {"section": 3, "title": "Section 3", "readers": [3699], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/secondhome_2505_librivox/secondhome_03_balzac_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2139}, {"section": 4, "title": "Section 4", "readers": [3699], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/secondhome_2505_librivox/secondhome_04_balzac_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2051}, {"section": 5, "title": "Section 5", "readers": [3699], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/secondhome_2505_librivox/secondhome_05_balzac_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2635}]}
