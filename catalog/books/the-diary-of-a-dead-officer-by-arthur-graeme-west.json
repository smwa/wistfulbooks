{"title": "Diary of a Dead Officer", "description": "Published posthumously in 1919, this collection of diary entries presents a scathing picture of army life and is said to be one of the most vivid accounts of daily life in the trenches. It chronicles West's increasing disillusion with war and his move toward pacifist and atheist beliefs. The final part consists of his powerful war poems, including <i>God, How I Hate You, You Young Cheerful Men</i>, and <i>Night Patrol</i>. West was killed by a sniper in 1917. In view of some of his poems, one wonders if death was not unwelcome.
