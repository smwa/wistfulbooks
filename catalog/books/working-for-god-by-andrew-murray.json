{"title": "Working for God", "description": "Andrew Murray wrote \u201cWorking for God\u201d, a book of daily meditations for a month, as a sequel to \u201cWaiting on God\u201d.  The object of the book is, in Murray\u2019s own words, to remind all Christian workers of the greatness and the glory of the work in which God gives a share.  It is the work of bringing people back to God \u2013 but it must be done in God\u2019s way and in God\u2019s power.  It is spiritual work, to be done by spiritual people.  In this book we find valuable insights into the calling that all Christians have, to work for the Lord in some capacity or other.  We also find how God\u2019s grace is sufficient, and that He can and will enable us to have fruitful lives; we really can trust God to show us how we can work effectively in His kingdom, perhaps in ways and with resources that we have not yet imagined! -
