{"title": "Practical Mysticism (Version 2)", "description": "I write only for the larger class which, repelled by the formidable appearance of more elaborate works on the subject, would yet like to know what is meant by mysticism, and what it has to offer to the average man: how it helps to solve his problems, how it harmonises with the duties and ideals of his active life. For this reason, I presuppose in my readers no knowledge whatever of the subject, either upon the philosophic, religious, or historical side. Nor, since I wish my appeal to be general, do I urge the special claim of any one theological system, any one metaphysical school. I have merely attempted to put the view of the universe and man's place in it which is common to all mystics in plain and untechnical language: and to suggest the practical conditions under which ordinary persons may participate in their experience. Therefore the abnormal states of consciousness which sometimes appear in connection with mystical genius are not discussed: my business being confined to the description of a faculty which all men possess in a greater or less degree. - Summary by the author's preface", "duration": 14853, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "2806", "name": "Evelyn Underhill"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/practicalmysticism_2403_librivox/mysticism2_2403.jpg", "copyright_year": "1915", "genres": ["Psychology", "Religion", "Modern"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Owlivia"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Owlivia"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Christine Rottger"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Larry Wilson"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Preface", "readers": [14439], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/practicalmysticism_2403_librivox/practicalmysticism_00_underhill_64kb.mp3", "duration": 557}, {"section": 1, "title": "Chapter 1", "readers": [14439], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/practicalmysticism_2403_librivox/practicalmysticism_01_underhill_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1040}, {"section": 2, "title": "Chapter2", "readers": [14439], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/practicalmysticism_2403_librivox/practicalmysticism_02_underhill_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1317}, {"section": 3, "title": "Chapter 3", "readers": [14439], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/practicalmysticism_2403_librivox/practicalmysticism_03_underhill_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1428}, {"section": 4, "title": "Chapter 4", "readers": [14439], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/practicalmysticism_2403_librivox/practicalmysticism_04_underhill_64kb.mp3", "duration": 835}, {"section": 5, "title": "Chapter 5", "readers": [14439], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/practicalmysticism_2403_librivox/practicalmysticism_05_underhill_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1593}, {"section": 6, "title": "Chapter 6", "readers": [14439], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/practicalmysticism_2403_librivox/practicalmysticism_06_underhill_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1154}, {"section": 7, "title": "Chapter 7", "readers": [14439], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/practicalmysticism_2403_librivox/practicalmysticism_07_underhill_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1455}, {"section": 8, "title": "Chapter 8", "readers": [14439], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/practicalmysticism_2403_librivox/practicalmysticism_08_underhill_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1715}, {"section": 9, "title": "Chapter 9", "readers": [14439], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/practicalmysticism_2403_librivox/practicalmysticism_09_underhill_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1897}, {"section": 10, "title": "Chapter 10", "readers": [14439], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/practicalmysticism_2403_librivox/practicalmysticism_10_underhill_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1862}]}
