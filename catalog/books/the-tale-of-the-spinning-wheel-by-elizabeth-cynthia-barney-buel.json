{"title": "Tale of the Spinning Wheel", "description": "Adapted from a talk given for various New England historical societies and chapters of the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR), this short book elaborates on the importance of of the spinning wheel as a technology of independence and a symbol of women's labor throughout the centuries, but especially during the American Revolution. The work of spinning is described in thorough detail, along with the processes of preparing flax, wool, and cotton fibers, with a closing call to readers that we should be grateful for (and emulate in our own time) the examples our foremothers set of determination and sacrifice.
