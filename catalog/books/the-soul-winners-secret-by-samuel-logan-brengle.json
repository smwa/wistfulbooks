{"title": "Soul Winner's Secret", "description": "Samuel Logan Brengle was a commissioner in the Salvation Army. His books are known for the practicality, joyfulness and authenticity. His life was spent working with people on the streets, so his insights into the work of the Holy Spirit are relevant to everyday life. His holiness was that of the street, the kitchen, and everyday life. His stories are of men and women living their daily lives. In this book, Brengle explores how to live the Christian life so that we are full of contagious joy; how to walk with Our Saviour in such close fellowship that our heart for others is as a flame of fire to flood the world with joy!<br><br>\n\nFrom the Preface by Commissioner Frederick Booth-Tucker: Many will be inspired by these pages to rise up and make a new start. There is not a piece of advice in the whole book that will tempt the weakest saint to despair, no fancied heights which will be beyond their reach. Certainly none can read the book without getting a new impetus to do and dare for God and souls, and none who carry out these instructions can fail to become in the highest, noblest and most lasting sense, successful soul-winners.
