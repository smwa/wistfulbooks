{"title": "Travels of Sir John Mandeville", "description": "This is an Elizabethan translation of a 14th century travelogue, allegedly composed by one Sir John Mandeville. According to the book, John de Mandeville crossed the sea in 1322 and travelled through Turkey, Tartary, Persia, Syria, Arabia, Egypt, Libya, Ethiopia, Chaldea, Amazonia, India and many countries about India. In his day, he was considered the foremost travel authority, but much of the imaginative accounts were debunked during the later ages of travel. While much of the information within the book is of a fantastic and unreliable nature, it has been a source of inspiration for poets and mined by scholars throughout the centuries. - Summary by Daniel Davison and TriciaG<br><br>\r\n\r\nProof-listeners: kathrinee and TriciaG", "duration": 32033, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "12974", "name": "Sir John Mandeville"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/travels_sir_john_mandeville_2303_librivox/mandeville_2303.jpg", "copyright_year": "1900", "genres": ["Culture & Heritage Fiction", "Travel Fiction"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "TriciaG"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "TriciaG"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "The Prologue", "readers": [14233], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/travels_sir_john_mandeville_2303_librivox/travelsofsirjohn_00_mandeville_64kb.mp3", "duration": 481}, {"section": 1, "title": "Chapter 1: To Teach you the Way out of England to Constantinople", "readers": [14233], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/travels_sir_john_mandeville_2303_librivox/travelsofsirjohn_01_mandeville_64kb.mp3", "duration": 262}, {"section": 2, "title": "Chapter 2: Of the Cross and Crown of our Lord Jesu Christ", "readers": [14233], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/travels_sir_john_mandeville_2303_librivox/travelsofsirjohn_02_mandeville_64kb.mp3", "duration": 525}, {"section": 3, "title": "Chapter 3: Of the City of Constantinople, and the Faith of the Greeks", "readers": [14233], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/travels_sir_john_mandeville_2303_librivox/travelsofsirjohn_03_mandeville_64kb.mp3", "duration": 601}, {"section": 4, "title": "Chapter 4: [Of the Way from Constantinople to Jerusalem] Of Saint John the Evangelist.
