{"title": "John Donne's Satires", "description": "Donne\u2019s Style<br>\nIn John Donne\u2019s day, a satire was such a poem as a satyr might compose.  Satyrs were rough, savage creatures in Greek mythology, human to the waist but goat from there down.  That is the reason that Donne\u2019s style in these poems exceeds his normal difficulty in syntax, vocabulary, thought, and meter.  His age enjoyed untangling such puzzles, and some poets cultivated obscurity as an art, called asprezza.  Wordplay like \u201cwhile bellows pant below\u201d (Satyre 2), where the same syllables, stressed differently, produce two different words almost side by side, entertained them.<br>\n\nAn acoustical analogue to obscurity, Donne\u2019s rhymes are often deliberately lame, while his rhythms nearly defy scansion and yet refuse to become mere prose.  By keeping the drum beat just barely audible, he makes us feel that we are stumbling, out of step\u2014neither marching nor merely walking.<br>\n\nWhy was this abuse of the reader enjoyable?  Perhaps for the same reason that grafitti appeals to some people.  At first glance Donne appears lax, but in fact he is naughty; not undisciplined but rebellious; he does not fail to abide by the rules but rather gives the impression of breaking them.<br>\n\nMetempsychosis<br>\nThe poem appears to be incomplete, its \u201cFirst Song\u201d having no counterpart, no \u201cSecond Song.\u201d  Similarly its promise to end by identifying what celebrity the soul in question now inhabits is never fulfilled.  On the contrary, the poem\u2019s initial epic pretentions founder at the second generation of mankind rather than tracing human history from the Garden of Eden to modern England, as was proposed.  In view of the author\u2019s mock-heroic tone, however, the poem\u2019s apparent incompletion may be part of the satire, so it does no harm to suppose it as complete as necessary to accomplish its purpose.<br>\n\nWhat it accomplishes is to demonstrate, by means of the Pythagorean doctrine of the transmigration of souls, the depravity of the object of the satire (identity unknown but perhaps easily guessed by Donne\u2019s audience).  According to this doctrine, also called metempsychosis, the various guises that a soul takes in its travels are rewards or punishments for its conduct in each of its incarnations.  It is debatable whether this process always leads to purification.  In this poem it appears rather to be simple unfolding, dilation, the full realization of the soul\u2019s potential.  This soul has an appalling capacity for evil, beginning ominously as the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge and never rising higher than the moral neutrality of a fish.  (A modern reader unfamiliar with The Bhagavad Gita may rely on Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde as background to the concept of the dilation and degradation of a soul.)<br>\n\nThe style of the poem reflects the theme of shape-changing, for Donne loves to employ words\u2019 multiple senses in close proximity:  <br>\n. . . Make my darke heavy Po\u00ebm light, and light . . . [not dark + not heavy]<br>\n. . . to heare / Whose story, with long patience you will long . . . [adjective + verb]<br>\n. . . Her, her fates threw . . . [object of verb + possessive]<br>\n. . . Her sinne had now brought in infirmities . . . [verbal particle + prefix]<br>\n. . . Ill steward of himself, himselfe in three yeares ends. . . . [object of preposition + object of verb]<br>\n. . . Yet them all these unkinde kinds feed upon . . . [adjective + noun]<br>\nSuch wordplay is common in Donne\u2019s satires, but in a poem chronicling the exploits of fishes, a sparrow, a wolf, and a mouse\u2014all being the same individual in different forms\u2014it seems especially appropriate. - Summary by Thomas Copeland", "duration": 4972, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "742", "name": "John Donne"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/librivoxcdcoverart34/johndonnessatires_2002.jpg", "copyright_year": "1912", "genres": ["Poetry", "Satire"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Thomas A.
