{"title": "Revolutions of Civilization", "description": "British archaeologist & Egyptologist, Flinders Petrie, discusses the history of civilization in Egypt, Greece, Rome & medieval Europe & correlates contemporary events in different countries. A measure of the quality of civilisation is proposed by a comparison of artisan skill and effort judged in art, sculpture, and architecture between the timelines of radically different cultures. A special focus on Egypt presents evidence in a series of phases of art skill, rather than the leadership of a dynasty.
