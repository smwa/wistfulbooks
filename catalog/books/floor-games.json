{"title": "Floor Games", "description": "H.G. Wells had so much fun playing with his children on the floor of their playroom, he decided to write a jovial little book to inspire other parents in their pursuit of quality time with the kids. While the raw materials available from hobby stores of his day were woefully short of the variety and quality of what can be bought easily now, he and his sons created their own worlds to rule. This short work describes two games of imagination played out upon the floor of his home - an archipelago of islands, and a thoroughly integrated city, conveniently organized with two mayoral positions for his sons \u201cG.P.W.\u201d and \u201cF.R.W.\u201d While the toy people appearing in their worlds were often of martial nature, Wells decided to leave description of military games to a later book: \u201cLittle Wars.\u201d", "duration": 2713, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "146", "name": "H.
