{"title": "Liberation: Marines in the Recapture of Guam", "description": "Guam became a territorial possession of the United States with the signing of the Treaty of Paris in 1899, ending the Spanish-American War. Earlier, on 21 June 1898, First Lieutenant John Twiggs \u201cHandsome Jack\u201d Myers had led a party of Marines ashore from the protected cruiser Charleston to accept the surrender of the Spanish authorities. Thus began a long Marine presence on Guam. The island, southernmost of the Marianas chain, was discovered by Ferdinand Magellan in 1521, but not occupied until 1688 when a small mission was established there by a Spanish priest and soldiers. When control of the rest of the Mariana Islands was given to Japan as a mandate power in 1919, Guam became an isolated and highly vulnerable American outpost in a Japanese sea. This American territory, 35 miles long, nine miles at its widest and four at its narrowest, shaped like a peanut fell quickly and easily in the early morning of 10 December 1941. With the opening of a two-hour, ever-increasing bombardment by six battleships, nine cruisers, a host of destroyers and rocket ships, laying their wrath on the wrinkled black hills, rice paddies, cliffs, and caves that faced the attacking fleet on the west side of the island, liberation day for Guam began at 0530, 21 July 1944. - Summary by Cyril J.
