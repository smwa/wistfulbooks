{"title": "Commentary on the Epistle to the Philippians", "description": "That the Expository Treatises of Calvin on Paul's Epistles should be considered by the most eminent critics to be peculiarly successful is the more remarkable, when we take into view the disadvantageous circumstances under which most, if not all, of them were prepared. His Commentaries on six of Paul's Epistles were written by him (as we are informed by Beza, in his Life of Calvin) in 1548, a year of most harassing conflict with the enemies of the truth. His correspondence, however, at this period, clearly shews that his devout mind found tranquility in an assurance of Divine support. In writing to Brentius, who was then living in exile at Basle, he says: \u201c Amidst all these calamities one consideration supports and refreshes my mind: I assure myself that God, in commencing the wonderful restoration of his Church, which we have witnessed, has not held out a vain and transient hope to us, but has begun a work that he will not fail to accomplish in spite of the malice of men and the opposition of Satan. In the meantime let us patiently undergo the purification which is necessary for us.\" - Summary by the translator", "duration": 14798, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "571", "name": "John Calvin"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/commentary_philippians_2304_librivox/commentaryphilippians_2304.jpg", "copyright_year": "1851", "genres": ["Christianity - Commentary"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "David Ronald"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "David Ronald"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "TriciaG"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "InTheDesert"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "The Argument", "readers": [14683], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/commentary_philippians_2304_librivox/philippians_01_calvin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 273}, {"section": 2, "title": "Chapter 1, verses 1-6", "readers": [14683], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/commentary_philippians_2304_librivox/philippians_02_calvin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 629}, {"section": 3, "title": "Verses 7-11", "readers": [14683], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/commentary_philippians_2304_librivox/philippians_03_calvin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 793}, {"section": 4, "title": "Verses 12-17", "readers": [14683], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/commentary_philippians_2304_librivox/philippians_04_calvin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 520}, {"section": 5, "title": "Verses 18-21", "readers": [14683], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/commentary_philippians_2304_librivox/philippians_05_calvin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 526}, {"section": 6, "title": "Verses 22-26", "readers": [14683], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/commentary_philippians_2304_librivox/philippians_06_calvin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 509}, {"section": 7, "title": "Verses 27-30", "readers": [14683], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/commentary_philippians_2304_librivox/philippians_07_calvin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 670}, {"section": 8, "title": "Chapter 2, verses 1-4", "readers": [14683], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/commentary_philippians_2304_librivox/philippians_08_calvin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 495}, {"section": 9, "title": "Verses 5-11", "readers": [14683], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/commentary_philippians_2304_librivox/philippians_09_calvin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1417}, {"section": 10, "title": "Verses 12-16", "readers": [14683], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/commentary_philippians_2304_librivox/philippians_10_calvin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1375}, {"section": 11, "title": "Verses 17-24", "readers": [14683], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/commentary_philippians_2304_librivox/philippians_11_calvin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 832}, {"section": 12, "title": "Verses 25-30", "readers": [14683], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/commentary_philippians_2304_librivox/philippians_12_calvin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 749}, {"section": 13, "title": "Chapter 3, verses 1-6", "readers": [14683], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/commentary_philippians_2304_librivox/philippians_13_calvin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1034}, {"section": 14, "title": "Verses 7-11", "readers": [14683], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/commentary_philippians_2304_librivox/philippians_14_calvin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1014}, {"section": 15, "title": "Verses 12-17", "readers": [14683], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/commentary_philippians_2304_librivox/philippians_15_calvin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 872}, {"section": 16, "title": "Verses 18-21", "readers": [14683], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/commentary_philippians_2304_librivox/philippians_16_calvin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 793}, {"section": 17, "title": "Chapter 4, verses 1-3", "readers": [14683], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/commentary_philippians_2304_librivox/philippians_17_calvin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 480}, {"section": 18, "title": "Verses 4-9", "readers": [14683], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/commentary_philippians_2304_librivox/philippians_18_calvin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 908}, {"section": 19, "title": "Verses 10-14", "readers": [14683], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/commentary_philippians_2304_librivox/philippians_19_calvin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 371}, {"section": 20, "title": "Verses 15-23", "readers": [14683], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/commentary_philippians_2304_librivox/philippians_20_calvin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 538}]}
