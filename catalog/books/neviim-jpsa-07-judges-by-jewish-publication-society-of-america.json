{"title": "Nevi\u2019im (JPSA) 07: Judges", "description": "The Book of Judges (Shoftim) is the second of the former prophets within Nevi\u2019im.  The book of Judges covers the time between the conquest described in the Book of Joshua and the establishment of a kingdom in the Books of Samuel, during which Biblical judges served as temporary leaders.\nJudges, tell of the struggle of the people to possess the land.  When the people are unfaithful, G_d delivers them into the hands of their enemies; once the people repent, mercy is given, a Judge delivers them from oppression until the cycle repeats.  \nJudges concludes with two appendices (17:1\u201321:25), giving two stories set in the time of the Judges, but not discussing the Judges themselves. - Summary by Wikipedia and Linette Geisel", "duration": 7506, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "5601", "name": " Jewish Publication Society of America"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/neviim_jpsa_07_judges_1810_librivox/nevi-im07_judges_1810.jpg", "copyright_year": "1917", "genres": ["Bibles"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Linette Geisel"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "TriciaG"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Linette Geisel"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Summary of the book of Joshua and introduction to Judges (Chapters 1-2)", "readers": [8425], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/neviim_jpsa_07_judges_1810_librivox/holyscripturesjudges_01_jpsa_64kb.mp3", "duration": 617}, {"section": 2, "title": "Othniel, Ehud, the minor judge Shamgar, and prophetess Deborah (Chapters 3-5)", "readers": [11715], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/neviim_jpsa_07_judges_1810_librivox/holyscripturesjudges_02_jpsa_64kb.mp3", "duration": 884}, {"section": 3, "title": "Gideon (Chapters 6-8)", "readers": [11039], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/neviim_jpsa_07_judges_1810_librivox/holyscripturesjudges_03_jpsa_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1305}, {"section": 4, "title": "King Abimelech and minor judges Tola and Jair (Chapters 9-10)", "readers": [12693], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/neviim_jpsa_07_judges_1810_librivox/holyscripturesjudges_04_jpsa_64kb.mp3", "duration": 967}, {"section": 5, "title": "Jephthah and minor judges Ibzan, Elon, and Abdon (Chapters 11-12)", "readers": [12672], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/neviim_jpsa_07_judges_1810_librivox/holyscripturesjudges_05_jpsa_64kb.mp3", "duration": 621}, {"section": 6, "title": "Samson (Chapters 13-16)", "readers": [2149], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/neviim_jpsa_07_judges_1810_librivox/holyscripturesjudges_06_jpsa_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1201}, {"section": 7, "title": "Michah\u2019s Idol, how the tribe of Dan conquers its territory in the north (Chapters 17-18)", "readers": [12672], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/neviim_jpsa_07_judges_1810_librivox/holyscripturesjudges_07_jpsa_64kb.mp3", "duration": 539}, {"section": 8, "title": "Battle of Gibeah, a war between Benjamin and the other tribes (Chapters 19-21)", "readers": [12693], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/neviim_jpsa_07_judges_1810_librivox/holyscripturesjudges_08_jpsa_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1372}]}
