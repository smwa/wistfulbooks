{"title": "Assault on Mount Everest, 1922", "description": "Personal narratives of climbing Mount Everest in 1922-1923. The expeditions did not reach the summit.  The northern approach to the mountain was discovered by George Mallory and Guy Bullock on the initial 1921 British Reconnaissance Expedition. It was an exploratory expedition not equipped for a serious attempt to climb the mountain. With Mallory leading (and thus becoming the first European to set foot on Everest's flanks) they climbed the North Col to an altitude of 7,005 metres (22,982 ft). From there, Mallory espied a route to the top, but the party was unprepared for the great task of climbing any further and descended. The British returned for a 1922 expedition. George Finch climbed using oxygen for the first time. He ascended at a remarkable speed\u2014290 metres (951 ft) per hour, and reached an altitude of 8,320 m (27,300 ft), the first time a human reported to climb higher than 8,000 m. Mallory and Col. Felix Norton made a second unsuccessful attempt. Mallory was faulted for leading a group down from the North Col which got caught in an avalanche. Mallory was pulled down too but survived. Seven native porters were killed.  - Summary by Wikipedia ", "duration": 34388, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "14684", "name": "Charles Granville Bruce"}, {"id": "14960", "name": "George Ingle Finch"}, {"id": "14961", "name": "Tom Longstaff"}, {"id": "13005", "name": "George Mallory"}, {"id": "14962", "name": "T.
