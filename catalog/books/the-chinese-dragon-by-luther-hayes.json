{"title": "Chinese Dragon", "description": "The subject of this little book [1923] is of general interest to people who are acquainted with things Chinese. The dragon has played a large part in Chinese thought through four thousand and more years\u2026.  The author is peculiarly fitted to undertake this piece of work. He was born in China and speaks the Chinese language as a native. Thus, he has had the first-hand knowledge and the language to help him in his study. He has been studying on the subject of the dragon for fourteen years. In this time, he has traveled over more than one half the number of provinces of China\u2026.  The author\u2019s acquaintance with the people and the language of China have made it possible for him to go to original sources and to study the subject from every angle.
