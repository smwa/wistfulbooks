{"title": "Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals", "description": "David Hume, an eminent Scottish philosopher, historian, and essayist, explores the nature and foundation of Morals in this book, which was written as a popular summary of Book III in A Treatise of Human Nature. Hume states: \u201cThere has been a controversy started of late, much better worth examination, concerning the general foundation of Morals; whether they be derived from Reason, or from Sentiment; whether we attain the knowledge of them by a chain of argument and induction, or by an immediate feeling and finer internal sense; whether, like all sound judgement of truth and falsehood, they should be the same to every rational intelligent being; or whether, like the perception of beauty and deformity, they be founded entirely on the particular fabric and constitution of the human species.\u201d (Excerpted from Section I \u2013 Of the General Principles of Morals) (Summary from the text and adapted from Wikipedia by lubee930)", "duration": 20762, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "70", "name": "David Hume"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt33/Enquiry_Concerning_Principles_Morals_1310.jpg", "copyright_year": "1751", "genres": ["Philosophy"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Lucretia B."}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Ruth Golding"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Jill Engle"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Section I.
