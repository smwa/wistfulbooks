{"title": "Legends of Saints and Sinners", "description": "\"I have called the present volume \"Legends of Saints and Sinners,\" which to a certain extent it is; but I mean it for a book of Irish Christian folk-lore. My idea in compiling it has been to give for the first time a collection of genuine Irish folk-lore which might be called \"Christian.\" By this I mean folk-stories and folk-poems which are either entirely founded upon Christian conceptions, or else are so far coloured by them, that they could never have been told\u2014at least in their present shape\u2014had not Christianity established itself in Ireland. Every one of these stories conforms fairly to this standard, except one or two, which I give as necessary corollaries. They are all translations from the Irish. I have found hardly any such stories in English. They were mostly collected by myself from the mouths of native speakers, but three or four of them I have taken from Irish MSS. in my own possession, and a few more were given me by my friends. Not one of these stories was ever translated into English before, with the exception of those which I have taken from my own \"Religious Songs of Connacht.\" - Summary by From The Introduction", "duration": 29191, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "14798", "name": "Douglas Hyde "}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/legends_of_saints_2008_librivox/saintsandsinners_2008.jpg", "copyright_year": "0", "genres": ["Culture & Heritage Fiction", "Myths", "Legends & Fairy Tales"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Stav Nisser"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Amy Gramour"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Helen Z.
