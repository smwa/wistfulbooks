{"title": "Tracts for the Times, Volume 1", "description": "Published between 1833 and 1841, the 90 Tracts were written by various members of \"The Oxford Movement\". They cover various aspects of Anglo-Catholic doctrine and other theological matters. The lead was taken by John Henry Newman (who made the largest contribution), but several other churchmen associated with Oxford University were also involved, among them John Keble, Hurrell Froude, and Edward Pusey. Among the newly written tracts were also re-prints of works from previous generations. The Tracts are of various lengths, ranging from a few pages to book-length works. The format and cheap prices, meant that the Tracts were widely disseminated. Volumes 1 and 2 also had new translations of the works of the early Fathers of the church appended to the end.<br><br>\r\n\r\nVolume 1 contains Tracts 1 to 46, along with 18 \"Records of the Church\". These last include all the extant epistles of St. Ignatius, alongside works by Justin Martyr, Iren\u00e6us, Clement of Alexandria, and Tertullian. Four accounts of martyrdoms and a tale of St. John round out the collection.
