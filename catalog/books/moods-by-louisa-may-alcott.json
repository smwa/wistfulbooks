{"title": "Moods", "description": "\"Life is a train of moods like a string of beads; and as we pass through them they prove to be many colored lenses, which paint the world their own hue,\nand each shows us only what lies in its own focus.\" Emerson. This quote opens the story of Sylvia, an intelligent and \"unreasonable\" 19th century young woman, who has to choose between the two men who love her. But every choice has consequences. This is the first serious book for adults by the author of the best-selling \"Little Women\". It is as lively and sharp. Perfect for the same fans, and for fans of George Eliot who wrote much about the same topics.  - Summary by Stav Nisser.", "duration": 35748, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "93", "name": "Louisa May Alcott"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/moods_1805_librivox/moods_1805.jpg", "copyright_year": "1864", "genres": ["Humorous Fiction"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Stav Nisser"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Amy Gramour"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Arlene Joyce"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "CHAPTER I.
