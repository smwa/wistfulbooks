{"title": "Pragmatism", "description": "'Pragmatism' contains a series of public lectures held by William James in Boston 1906\u20137. James provides a popularizing outline of his view of philosophical pragmatism while making highly rhetorical and entertaining lashes towards rationalism and other competing schools of thought. James is especially concerned with the pragmatic view of truth. True beliefs should be defined as, according to James, beliefs that can successfully assist people in their everyday life. This is claimed to not be relativism. That reality exists is argued to be a fact true beyond the human subject. James argues, nevertheless, that people select which parts of reality are made relevant and how they are understood to relate to each other. Charles Sanders Peirce, widely considered to be the founder of pragmatism, eventually chose to separate himself intellectually from James, renaming his own theory to \u2018pragmaticism\u2019.", "duration": 23571, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "942", "name": "William James"}], "coverArt": "http://archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt26/pragmatism_1301.jpg", "copyright_year": "1907", "genres": ["*Non-fiction", "Essays & Short Works", "Philosophy"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Fredrik Karlsson"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Fredrik Karlsson"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Bart de Leeuw"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Leni"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Preface", "readers": [3955], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/pragmatism_1006_librivox/pragmatism_00_james_64kb.mp3", "duration": 221}, {"section": 1, "title": "Lecture 1: The Present Dilemma in Philosophy, part 1", "readers": [3955], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/pragmatism_1006_librivox/pragmatism_01_james_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1622}, {"section": 2, "title": "Lecture 1: The Present Dilemma in Philosophy, part 2", "readers": [3955], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/pragmatism_1006_librivox/pragmatism_02_james_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1599}, {"section": 3, "title": "Lecture 2: What Pragmatism Means, part 1", "readers": [3955], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/pragmatism_1006_librivox/pragmatism_03_james_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1723}, {"section": 4, "title": "Lecture 2: What Pragmatism Means, part 2", "readers": [3955], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/pragmatism_1006_librivox/pragmatism_04_james_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1463}, {"section": 5, "title": "Lecture 3: Some Metaphysical Problems Pragmatically Considered, part 1", "readers": [3955], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/pragmatism_1006_librivox/pragmatism_05_james_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1509}, {"section": 6, "title": "Lecture 3: Some Metaphysical Problems Pragmatically Considered, part 2", "readers": [3955], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/pragmatism_1006_librivox/pragmatism_06_james_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1656}, {"section": 7, "title": "Lecture 4: The One and the Many, part 1", "readers": [3955], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/pragmatism_1006_librivox/pragmatism_07_james_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1530}, {"section": 8, "title": "Lecture 4: The One and the Many, part 2", "readers": [3955], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/pragmatism_1006_librivox/pragmatism_08_james_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1414}, {"section": 9, "title": "Lecture 5: Pragmatism and Common Sense, part 1", "readers": [3955], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/pragmatism_1006_librivox/pragmatism_09_james_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1114}, {"section": 10, "title": "Lecture 5: Pragmatism and Common Sense, part 2", "readers": [3955], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/pragmatism_1006_librivox/pragmatism_10_james_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1323}, {"section": 11, "title": "Lecture 6: Pragmatism's Conception of Truth. part 1", "readers": [3955], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/pragmatism_1006_librivox/pragmatism_11_james_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1640}, {"section": 12, "title": "Lecture 6: Pragmatism's Conception of Truth. part 2", "readers": [3955], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/pragmatism_1006_librivox/pragmatism_12_james_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1761}, {"section": 13, "title": "Lecture 7: Pragmatism and Humanism, part 1", "readers": [3955], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/pragmatism_1006_librivox/pragmatism_13_james_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1323}, {"section": 14, "title": "Lecture 7: Pragmatism and Humanism, part 2", "readers": [3955], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/pragmatism_1006_librivox/pragmatism_14_james_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1330}, {"section": 15, "title": "Lecture 8: Pragmatism and Religion, part 1", "readers": [3955], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/pragmatism_1006_librivox/pragmatism_15_james_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1136}, {"section": 16, "title": "Lecture 8: Pragmatism and Religion, part 2", "readers": [3955], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/pragmatism_1006_librivox/pragmatism_16_james_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1207}]}
