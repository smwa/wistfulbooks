{"title": "Short Nonfiction Collection, Vol. 098", "description": "\"The moment a man attempts to tell the truth as he not only thinks but feels it, what he says becomes charged with that man himself.\" This gem is from Walter de la Mare's Some Thoughts on Reading. That \"truth\" often varies by viewpoint is shown in many of the reader-chosen selections in vol. 098: Scotland Trading to Africa and the West Indies; A Letter on the Arrival at Darien; Loving v. Virginia; Cremation versus Earth Burial; The Covenant of the League of Nations; When the Sea-Asp Stings; Death in the Black Hole at Calcutta; City Boys vs. Country Boys; Birthplaces and Heredity; Locke's Essay on Human Understanding; Plato's Ion; The State of the British Nation (1710); Second Memory from Memories; and Twelve Medieval Ghost Stories. Other selections portray small town and country life: Blessed be the Horse; Story of Broomcorn; Provincetown and Petrified Fish; while literary insights round out the volume: The Man Merriwell; and Style in English.
