{"title": "Bear Family at Home", "description": "THE BEAR FAMILY AT HOME -And How the Circus Came to Visit Them\nOnce a little cub bear was caught in a big log trap, and taken on a train to a circus. He lived in the circus a long, long while, and every day a great many people came to see the bear, and the lions, and the tigers, and the leopards, and the elephants, and the camels, and the other animals. \nEvery night the animals would all be put in the wagons made for them, then the wagons would be rolled on the flat-cars of a railroad train. The train would go all night to another town, where a great many people would come to see the animals and the men and women in the circus. The Cub Bear saw a great many wonderful and strange things while he was in the circus and while traveling on the trains. Once he crossed the ocean in a great ship, and came back again in another ship. The first story tells How the Little Bear got free from the circus and back in the woods again. : - Summary by the author", "duration": 13002, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "14384", "name": "Curtis D.
