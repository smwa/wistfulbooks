{"title": "Seven Who Were Hanged", "description": "\"I am very glad that \"The Story of the Seven Who Were Hanged\" will be read in English. The misfortune of us all is that we know so little, even nothing, about one another\u2014neither about the soul, nor the life, the sufferings, the habits, the inclinations, the aspirations of one another. Literature, which I have the honor to serve, is dear to me just because the noblest task it sets before itself is that of wiping out boundaries and distances.\"\n-- Leonid Andreyev, in a letter to Herman Bernstein", "duration": 13034, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "231", "name": "Leonid Nikolayevich Andreyev"}], "coverArt": "http://archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt19/seven_hanged_1206.jpg", "copyright_year": "1909", "genres": ["General Fiction"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Crln Yldz Ksr"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Crln Yldz Ksr"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Crln Yldz Ksr"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Piotr Nater"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "00 - Dedication, Foreword and Introduction", "readers": [5244], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/seven_hanged_1202_librivox/sevenhanged_00_andreyev_64kb.mp3", "duration": 541}, {"section": 1, "title": "01 - At One O'Clock, Your Excellency!", "readers": [5244], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/seven_hanged_1202_librivox/sevenhanged_01_andreyev_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1062}, {"section": 2, "title": "02 - Condemned to be Hanged", "readers": [5244], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/seven_hanged_1202_librivox/sevenhanged_02_andreyev_64kb.mp3", "duration": 901}, {"section": 3, "title": "03 - Why Should I be Hanged?", "readers": [5244], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/seven_hanged_1202_librivox/sevenhanged_03_andreyev_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1807}, {"section": 4, "title": "04 - We Come from Oryol", "readers": [5244], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/seven_hanged_1202_librivox/sevenhanged_04_andreyev_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1040}, {"section": 5, "title": "05 - Kiss - And Say Nothing", "readers": [5244], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/seven_hanged_1202_librivox/sevenhanged_05_andreyev_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1127}, {"section": 6, "title": "06 - The Hours are Rushing", "readers": [5244], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/seven_hanged_1202_librivox/sevenhanged_06_andreyev_64kb.mp3", "duration": 256}, {"section": 7, "title": "07 - There is no Death", "readers": [5244], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/seven_hanged_1202_librivox/sevenhanged_07_andreyev_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1225}, {"section": 8, "title": "08 - There is Death as well as Life", "readers": [5244], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/seven_hanged_1202_librivox/sevenhanged_08_andreyev_64kb.mp3", "duration": 839}, {"section": 9, "title": "09 - Dreadful Solitude", "readers": [5244], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/seven_hanged_1202_librivox/sevenhanged_09_andreyev_64kb.mp3", "duration": 871}, {"section": 10, "title": "10 - The Walls are Falling", "readers": [5244], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/seven_hanged_1202_librivox/sevenhanged_10_andreyev_64kb.mp3", "duration": 810}, {"section": 11, "title": "11 - On the Way to the Scaffold", "readers": [5244], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/seven_hanged_1202_librivox/sevenhanged_11_andreyev_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2555}]}
