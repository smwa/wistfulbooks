{"title": "Supreme Cases from 1803-2018", "description": "These cases involved questions that came before the Supreme Court that needed answers. The questions in order of appearance in this project are as follows.\nDoes Congress have the power to pass laws that override the Constitution? What shall we do about the international slave trade? In what respect does the right of an author differ from that of an individual who has invented a most useful and valuable machine? Is there any difference between property in slaves and other property? Can the House of Representatives impeach the President? Why were women excluded from suffrage in nearly all the states by the express provision of their constitutions and laws? Is a tomato a fruit or a vegetable? What is double jeopardy? What shall we do about a child born in the United States who has parents who are subjects of a different nation? Are lotteries legal? Should motion pictures be censured? Is speech protected under the First Amendment during wartime? Why did we stop saying the pledge of allegiance? Where does the idea of \"one person, one vote\" come from? How does the First Amendment protect us from a claim of defamation or libel? Is electronic eavesdropping legal? Why are churches tax free institutions? How was the decision to allow abortions made?
