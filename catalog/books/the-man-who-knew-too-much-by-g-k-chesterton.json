{"title": "Man Who Knew Too Much", "description": "Gilbert Keith Chesterton (1874-1936) was an influential and prolific English writer of the early 20th century. He was a journalist, a poet and a novelist. He wrote 80 books and 200 short stories in addition to his other work. He is perhaps best remembered for his \u2018Father Brown\u2019 stories; two collections of which are available at Librivox.org.<br /><br />\n\u2018The Man Who Knew Too Much\u2019 has some similarities to the Father Brown stories: Horne Fisher the eponymous hero is connected and indeed related to many of the high-ranking politicians of his age and thus \u2018knows too much\u2019 about the background of the mysteries in which he becomes embroiled and which he unravels.
