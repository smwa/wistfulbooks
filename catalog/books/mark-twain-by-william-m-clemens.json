{"title": "Mark Twain; his life and work. A biographical sketch", "description": "As far as anyone has been able to establish, Will Clemens was NOT related to Sam Clemens (Mark Twain), though they did become acquaintances. The 200-page biography Will Clemens wrote and published himself may have been the earliest full-length study of MT. It was published July 1,1892 as \"No. 1\" in a paperback series called \"The Pacific Library,\" price 25\u00a2, and did well enough to be republished in 1894 by a publisher in Chicago. Throughout the book Clemens relies mainly on other writers' previously published work.
