{"title": "Harper's Young People, Vol. 01, Issue 21, March 23, 1880", "description": "Harper's Young People, an illustrated weekly publication for children, includes serialized and one-off short stories, tales from history, poetry, puzzles, and other fun. This 21st issue of the serial, published on March 23, 1880, transports readers to steep mountain sides in Switzerland where wild chamois play, to a kingdom with a vengeful wolf searching for the tailor who wronged him, to a busy barnyard where a boy's creative thinking saves his friend, and to many more real and fantastical places. This periodical was published by Harper & Brothers, known today for their other publications Harper's Bazaar and Harper's Magazine.
