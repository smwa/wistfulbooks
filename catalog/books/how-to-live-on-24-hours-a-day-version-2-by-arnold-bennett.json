{"title": "How to Live on 24 Hours a Day (version 2)", "description": "Are you really 'living', or just existing?  Do you want to improve yourself or just continue to muddle through?  Do you use the time given you each day, or just throw most of it away?  These questions Bennett asks each of us and for those who want to really live and learn, offers very valuable advice.<br /><br />\n\nTime is the most precious of commodities, states Bennett in this book. Many books have been written on how to live on a certain amount of money each day. And he added that the old adage \"time is money\" understates the matter, as time can often produce money, but money cannot produce more time. Time is extremely limited, and Bennett urged others to make the best of the time remaining in their lives.    Which of us lives on twenty-four hours a day? And when I say \"lives,\" I do not mean exists, nor \"muddles through.\" Which of us is free from that uneasy feeling that the \"great spending departments\" of his daily life are not managed as they ought to be? [...] Which of us is not saying to himself -- which of us has not been saying to himself all his life: \"I shall alter that when I have a little more time\"? We never shall have any more time. We have, and we have always had, all the time there is. - Summary from the author's preface and the reader.", "duration": 5783, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "263", "name": "Arnold Bennett"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/howtoliveon24hoursaday_1504_librivox/howtolive_1504.jpg", "copyright_year": "0", "genres": ["Business & Economics", "Self-Help"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Ann Boulais"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "PREFACE", "readers": [5717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/howtoliveon24hoursaday_1504_librivox/howtoliveon24hoursaday_00_bennett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 677}, {"section": 1, "title": "THE DAILY MIRACLE", "readers": [5717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/howtoliveon24hoursaday_1504_librivox/howtoliveon24hoursaday_01_bennett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 450}, {"section": 2, "title": "THE DESIRE TO EXCEED ONE'S PROGRAMME", "readers": [5717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/howtoliveon24hoursaday_1504_librivox/howtoliveon24hoursaday_02_bennett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 424}, {"section": 3, "title": "PRECAUTIONS BEFORE BEGINNING", "readers": [5717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/howtoliveon24hoursaday_1504_librivox/howtoliveon24hoursaday_03_bennett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 437}, {"section": 4, "title": "THE CAUSE OF THE TROUBLE", "readers": [5717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/howtoliveon24hoursaday_1504_librivox/howtoliveon24hoursaday_04_bennett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 430}, {"section": 5, "title": "TENNIS AND THE IMMORTAL SOUL", "readers": [5717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/howtoliveon24hoursaday_1504_librivox/howtoliveon24hoursaday_05_bennett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 461}, {"section": 6, "title": "REMEMBER HUMAN NATURE", "readers": [5717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/howtoliveon24hoursaday_1504_librivox/howtoliveon24hoursaday_06_bennett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 387}, {"section": 7, "title": "CONTROLLING THE MIND", "readers": [5717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/howtoliveon24hoursaday_1504_librivox/howtoliveon24hoursaday_07_bennett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 406}, {"section": 8, "title": "THE REFLECTIVE MOOD", "readers": [5717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/howtoliveon24hoursaday_1504_librivox/howtoliveon24hoursaday_08_bennett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 434}, {"section": 9, "title": "INTEREST IN THE ARTS", "readers": [5717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/howtoliveon24hoursaday_1504_librivox/howtoliveon24hoursaday_09_bennett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 409}, {"section": 10, "title": "NOTHING IN LIFE IS HUMDRUM", "readers": [5717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/howtoliveon24hoursaday_1504_librivox/howtoliveon24hoursaday_10_bennett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 404}, {"section": 11, "title": "SERIOUS READING", "readers": [5717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/howtoliveon24hoursaday_1504_librivox/howtoliveon24hoursaday_11_bennett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 435}, {"section": 12, "title": "DANGERS TO AVOID", "readers": [5717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/howtoliveon24hoursaday_1504_librivox/howtoliveon24hoursaday_12_bennett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 429}]}
