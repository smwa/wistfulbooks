{"title": "Sick Man's Comfort Book", "description": "Amongst the many wonderful truths which are spoken of God in the Bible, one of the most wonderful and beautiful is that He is a \"God of comfort.\"<br><br> \"Comfort\" is such a soothing word in itself, that, the moment we hear of it in connection with God we are led to expect great things; some cheering, some lifting up, some refreshment, some ease, some lightening of our trouble, something very good.<br><br>O Thou most worthy judge eternal, we have no comfort in ourselves, and unless Thou hadst revealed Thyself as a comforting God we could have had none in Thee.  Show Thyself to us, as Thou art in Thy word.  Comfort us with the kindness that there is in Thyself; and speak peace to all the readers of this book, for the sake of The Great Peacemaker, -- the Prince of peace, Jesus Christ Himself -- Amen.
