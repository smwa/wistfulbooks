{"title": "Song of the Chattahoochee", "description": "Sidney Clopton Lanier was an American musician, poet and author. He served in the Confederate army, worked on a blockade running ship for which he was imprisoned (resulting in his catching tuberculosis), taught, worked at a hotel where he gave musical performances, was a church organist, and worked as a lawyer. As a poet he used dialects. He became a flautist and sold poems to publications. He eventually became a university professor and is known for his adaptation of musical meter to poetry. Many schools, other structures and two lakes are named for him.", "duration": 1855, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "3020", "name": "Sidney Lanier"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/song_of_the_chattahoochee_1505.poem_librivox/song_of_the_chattahoochee_1505.jpg", "copyright_year": "0", "genres": ["Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "The Song of the Chattahoochee. - Read by ALP", "readers": [4705], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/song_of_the_chattahoochee_1505.poem_librivox/chattahoochee_lanier_alp_64kb.mp3", "duration": 165}, {"section": 2, "title": "The Song of the Chattahoochee. - Read by CB", "readers": [9862], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/song_of_the_chattahoochee_1505.poem_librivox/chattahoochee_lanier_cb_64kb.mp3", "duration": 133}, {"section": 3, "title": "The Song of the Chattahoochee. - Read by CCS", "readers": [8337], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/song_of_the_chattahoochee_1505.poem_librivox/chattahoochee_lanier_ccs_64kb.mp3", "duration": 210}, {"section": 4, "title": "The Song of the Chattahoochee. - Read by CLP", "readers": [9642], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/song_of_the_chattahoochee_1505.poem_librivox/chattahoochee_lanier_clp_64kb.mp3", "duration": 140}, {"section": 5, "title": "The Song of the Chattahoochee. - Read by DCC", "readers": [10038], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/song_of_the_chattahoochee_1505.poem_librivox/chattahoochee_lanier_dcc_64kb.mp3", "duration": 176}, {"section": 6, "title": "The Song of the Chattahoochee. - Read by DL", "readers": [2911], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/song_of_the_chattahoochee_1505.poem_librivox/chattahoochee_lanier_dl_64kb.mp3", "duration": 183}, {"section": 7, "title": "The Song of the Chattahoochee. - Read by EL", "readers": [9872], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/song_of_the_chattahoochee_1505.poem_librivox/chattahoochee_lanier_el_64kb.mp3", "duration": 135}, {"section": 8, "title": "The Song of the Chattahoochee. - Read by GG", "readers": [8011], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/song_of_the_chattahoochee_1505.poem_librivox/chattahoochee_lanier_gg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 189}, {"section": 9, "title": "The Song of the Chattahoochee. - Read by LCW", "readers": [8425], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/song_of_the_chattahoochee_1505.poem_librivox/chattahoochee_lanier_lcw_64kb.mp3", "duration": 161}, {"section": 10, "title": "The Song of the Chattahoochee. - Read by LLW", "readers": [4738], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/song_of_the_chattahoochee_1505.poem_librivox/chattahoochee_lanier_llw_64kb.mp3", "duration": 191}, {"section": 11, "title": "The Song of the Chattahoochee. - Read by NB", "readers": [6965], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/song_of_the_chattahoochee_1505.poem_librivox/chattahoochee_lanier_nb_64kb.mp3", "duration": 172}]}
