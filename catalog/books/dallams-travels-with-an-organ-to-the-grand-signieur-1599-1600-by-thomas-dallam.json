{"title": "Dallam's Travels with an Organ to the Grand Signieur, 1599-1600", "description": "Queen Elizabeth the First of England,  the Grand Turk at Constantinople, and  an organ builder named Thomas Dallam\u2014quite a trio.  In 1599, Elizabeth commanded master organ builder Dallam to construct and deliver to the Grand Signieur , as a present intended to garner trade and political advantages for England, a fantastic mechanical organ.  Dallam\u2019s wonder stood 16 feet high and was topped by  a silver  holly bush filled with blackbirds and thrushes that sung and shook their wings.   Dallam kept a diary during his visit to Turkey, which included a sneak look through a grate at the Grand Turk\u2019s concubines in the harem.  \u201cI stood so long looking upon them that (the guide) stamped with his foot to make me give over looking; the which I was very loath to do, for that sight did please me wondrous well.\u201d  Dallam\u2019s ingenuous style and numerous adventures make for a highly enjoyable listen.  - Summary by Sue Anderson", "duration": 13875, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "10024", "name": "Thomas Dallam"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt33/book_dallamstravels_1310.jpg", "copyright_year": "1893", "genres": ["Memoirs"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Sue Anderson"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Sue Anderson"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "J.
