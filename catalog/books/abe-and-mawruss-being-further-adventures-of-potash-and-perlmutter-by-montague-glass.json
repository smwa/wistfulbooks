{"title": "Abe and Mawruss: Being Further Adventures of Potash and Perlmutter", "description": "Montague Glass was a lawyer who eventually abandoned the practice of law to write full time. He wrote a series of stories in the New York Post about a pair of popular characters in the predominantly Jewish garment trade. Many of the plots were derived from trade problems he saw as a lawyer. This is the second book of the collected stories; his Potash and Perlmutter stories were also made into stage plays and even movies that were very popular in their time. - Summary by ToddHW", "duration": 30651, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "3452", "name": "Montague Glass"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/abeandmawruss_1807_librivox/abe_mawruss_1807.jpg", "copyright_year": "1909", "genres": ["Humorous Fiction"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "ToddHW"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "ToddHW"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "DaveC"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Sympathy", "readers": [5872], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/abeandmawruss_1807_librivox/abeandmawruss_01_glass_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2426}, {"section": 2, "title": "The Judgement of Paris", "readers": [5872], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/abeandmawruss_1807_librivox/abeandmawruss_02_glass_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2738}, {"section": 3, "title": "Dead Men's Shoes, Part 1", "readers": [5872], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/abeandmawruss_1807_librivox/abeandmawruss_03_glass_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1831}, {"section": 4, "title": "Dead Men's Shoes, Part 2", "readers": [5872], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/abeandmawruss_1807_librivox/abeandmawruss_04_glass_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2284}, {"section": 5, "title": "The Raincoat King", "readers": [5872], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/abeandmawruss_1807_librivox/abeandmawruss_05_glass_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2753}, {"section": 6, "title": "A Return to Arcady, Part 1", "readers": [5872], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/abeandmawruss_1807_librivox/abeandmawruss_06_glass_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2079}, {"section": 7, "title": "A Return to Arcady, Part 2", "readers": [5872], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/abeandmawruss_1807_librivox/abeandmawruss_07_glass_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1465}, {"section": 8, "title": "A Present for Mr. Geigrmann, Part 1", "readers": [5872], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/abeandmawruss_1807_librivox/abeandmawruss_08_glass_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1758}, {"section": 9, "title": "A Present for Mr. Geigrmann, Part 2", "readers": [5872], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/abeandmawruss_1807_librivox/abeandmawruss_09_glass_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1988}, {"section": 10, "title": "Brothers All, Part 1", "readers": [5872], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/abeandmawruss_1807_librivox/abeandmawruss_10_glass_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1395}, {"section": 11, "title": "Brothers All, Part 2", "readers": [5872], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/abeandmawruss_1807_librivox/abeandmawruss_11_glass_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2354}, {"section": 12, "title": "R.
