{"title": "Half-Breed: A Tale of the Western Frontier", "description": "Published anonymously in The Brooklyn Daily Eagle (with an earlier draft also appearing as \u201cArrow-Tip\u201d in The Aristidean), The Half-Breed: A Tale of the Western Frontier is one of the few known works of long-form fiction written by Walt Whitman during the earliest part of his career. It tells the story of Arrow-Tip, a Native American who falls victim to frontier prejudice after the presumed murder of local blacksmith Peter Brown. Despite his presumed innocence, he is soon sentenced to die by hanging \u2014 even though there exists evidence that could possibly exonerate him. This narrative is further complicated by the presence of Boddo, a hideously deformed hunchback who is ostracized by the white settlers due to his mixed-race heritage. Fueled by spite and anger, Boddo uses this opportunity to take vengeance upon those who once tormented and humiliated him. - Summary by ChuckW", "duration": 7910, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "588", "name": "Walt Whitman"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/the_half-breed_1905_librivox/half_breed_1905.jpg", "copyright_year": "1846", "genres": ["Published 1800 -1900"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Chuck Williamson"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Chuck Williamson"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "DaveC"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Larry Wilson"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Chapter I", "readers": [7079], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_half-breed_1905_librivox/halfbreed_01_whitman_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1215}, {"section": 2, "title": "Chapter II", "readers": [7079], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_half-breed_1905_librivox/halfbreed_02_whitman_64kb.mp3", "duration": 661}, {"section": 3, "title": "Chapter III", "readers": [7079], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_half-breed_1905_librivox/halfbreed_03_whitman_64kb.mp3", "duration": 769}, {"section": 4, "title": "Chapter IV", "readers": [7079], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_half-breed_1905_librivox/halfbreed_04_whitman_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1150}, {"section": 5, "title": "Chapter V", "readers": [7079], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_half-breed_1905_librivox/halfbreed_05_whitman_64kb.mp3", "duration": 654}, {"section": 6, "title": "Chapter VI", "readers": [7079], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_half-breed_1905_librivox/halfbreed_06_whitman_64kb.mp3", "duration": 729}, {"section": 7, "title": "Chapter VII", "readers": [7079], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_half-breed_1905_librivox/halfbreed_07_whitman_64kb.mp3", "duration": 787}, {"section": 8, "title": "Chaptr VIII", "readers": [7079], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_half-breed_1905_librivox/halfbreed_08_whitman_64kb.mp3", "duration": 747}, {"section": 9, "title": "Chapter IX", "readers": [7079], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_half-breed_1905_librivox/halfbreed_09_whitman_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1198}]}
