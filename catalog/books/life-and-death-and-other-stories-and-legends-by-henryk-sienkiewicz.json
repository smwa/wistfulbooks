{"title": "Life and Death, and Other Stories and Legends", "description": "Henryk Sienkiewicz won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1905, but as he wrote in Polish many English-speakers are unfamiliar with his work. This short story collection is a sampler of five myths and legends which he collected. The \"Life and Death\" of the title is a Hindu legend, the rest of Polish stories. All are short and together form a little taste of this great author who is too often unknown to English readers. - Summary by Beth Thomas", "duration": 2276, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "1966", "name": "Henryk Sienkiewicz"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/lifeanddeath_1406_librivox/life_death_1406.jpg", "copyright_year": "1904", "genres": ["Myths", "Legends & Fairy Tales"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Beth Thomas (1974-2020)"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "TriciaG"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Piotr Nater"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Life and Death", "readers": [8917], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/lifeanddeath_1406_librivox/lifeanddeath_01_sienkiewicz_64kb.mp3", "duration": 629}, {"section": 2, "title": "Is He the Dearest One?", "readers": [8917], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/lifeanddeath_1406_librivox/lifeanddeath_02_sienkiewicz_64kb.mp3", "duration": 203}, {"section": 3, "title": "A Legend of the Sea", "readers": [4511], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/lifeanddeath_1406_librivox/lifeanddeath_03_sienkiewicz_64kb.mp3", "duration": 399}, {"section": 4, "title": "The Cranes", "readers": [5694], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/lifeanddeath_1406_librivox/lifeanddeath_04_sienkiewicz_64kb.mp3", "duration": 541}, {"section": 5, "title": "The Judgement of Peter and Paul on Olympus", "readers": [8917], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/lifeanddeath_1406_librivox/lifeanddeath_05_sienkiewicz_64kb.mp3", "duration": 504}]}
