{"title": "John G. Paton, Missionary to the New Hebrides: An Autobiography; First Part", "description": "\u201cMr. Dickson, you are advanced in years now, and your own prospect is soon to be laid in the grave, there to be eaten by worms; I confess to you, that if I can but live and die serving and honouring the Lord Jesus, it will make no difference to me whether I am eaten by Cannibals or by worms; and in the Great Day my resurrection body will arise as fair as yours in the likeness of our risen Redeemer.\u201d This was John G. Paton's reply to one of his many friends in Scotland who objected to him leaving his work there to go as a missionary to the New Hebrides. Over the next four years, despite many challenges and difficulties, Paton labored on the island of Tanna. He was often in danger of being killed by the cannibals but felt it his duty to remain for the sake of those attending his worship services. Through Paton's account of his life, this book serves as an encouragement to all Christians of the greatness of our God and also challenges us to consider what we would be willing to risk for the sake of sharing the gospel.
