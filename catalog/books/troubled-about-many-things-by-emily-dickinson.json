{"title": "Troubled About Many Things", "description": "The verses of Emily Dickinson belong emphatically to what Emerson long since called \"the Poetry of the Portfolio,\"\u2014something produced absolutely without the thought of publication, and solely by way of expression of the writer's own mind.\n A recluse by temperament and habit, literally spending years without setting her foot beyond the doorstep, and many more years during which her walks were strictly limited to her father's grounds, she habitually concealed her mind, like her person, from all but a very few friends; and it was with great difficulty that she was persuaded to print, during her lifetime, three or four poems. Yet she wrote verses in great abundance.
