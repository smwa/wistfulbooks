{"title": "Towards Democracy", "description": "\u201cCivilization sinks and swims, but the old facts remain\u2014the sun smiles, knowing well its strength.\u201d  Edward Carpenter (1844-1929) wrote his prose poem, Towards Democracy, styled after Walt Whitman\u2019s Leaves of Grass, in a summer burst of creativity.  \u201cEarly in 1881, no doubt as the culmination and result of struggles and experiences that had been going on, I became conscious that a mass of material was forming within me, imperatively demanding expression . . .\u201d  An English intellectual,  Carpenter was in rebellion against Victorian prudery. Railing against Industrialization\u2019s dehumanization, he preached a return to a simple life in harmony with Nature.  Towards Democracy reads like Beat poetry\u2014wild flowing word associations, moments of insight so clear they hurt, interspersed with pure rant!   Included is an essay Carpenter wrote in 1894 explaining his intent and feelings in writing Towards Democracy.  - Summary by Sue Anderson", "duration": 14106, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "8424", "name": "Edward Carpenter"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt33/towardsdemocracy_1312.jpg", "copyright_year": "1883", "genres": ["Poetry", "Social Science (Culture & Anthropology)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Sue Anderson"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Sue Anderson"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Availle"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "sidneyg"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Preface: A Note on Towards Democracy", "readers": [3003], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/towards_democracy_sa_librivox/towardsdemocracy_00_carpenter_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1310}, {"section": 1, "title": "I - IX", "readers": [3003], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/towards_democracy_sa_librivox/towardsdemocracy_01_carpenter_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1637}, {"section": 2, "title": "X - XVI", "readers": [3003], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/towards_democracy_sa_librivox/towardsdemocracy_02_carpenter_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1400}, {"section": 3, "title": "XVII - XXIV", "readers": [3003], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/towards_democracy_sa_librivox/towardsdemocracy_03_carpenter_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1030}, {"section": 4, "title": "XXV - XXXI", "readers": [3003], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/towards_democracy_sa_librivox/towardsdemocracy_04_carpenter_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1108}, {"section": 5, "title": "XXXII - XXXVI", "readers": [3003], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/towards_democracy_sa_librivox/towardsdemocracy_05_carpenter_64kb.mp3", "duration": 892}, {"section": 6, "title": "XXXVII - XL", "readers": [3003], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/towards_democracy_sa_librivox/towardsdemocracy_06_carpenter_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1363}, {"section": 7, "title": "XLI - XLVI", "readers": [3003], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/towards_democracy_sa_librivox/towardsdemocracy_07_carpenter_64kb.mp3", "duration": 951}, {"section": 8, "title": "XLVII - LI", "readers": [3003], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/towards_democracy_sa_librivox/towardsdemocracy_08_carpenter_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1076}, {"section": 9, "title": "LII - LV", "readers": [3003], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/towards_democracy_sa_librivox/towardsdemocracy_09_carpenter_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1036}, {"section": 10, "title": "LVI - LX", "readers": [3003], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/towards_democracy_sa_librivox/towardsdemocracy_10_carpenter_64kb.mp3", "duration": 816}, {"section": 11, "title": "LXI - LXV", "readers": [3003], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/towards_democracy_sa_librivox/towardsdemocracy_11_carpenter_64kb.mp3", "duration": 850}, {"section": 12, "title": "LXVI - LXX", "readers": [3003], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/towards_democracy_sa_librivox/towardsdemocracy_12_carpenter_64kb.mp3", "duration": 637}]}
