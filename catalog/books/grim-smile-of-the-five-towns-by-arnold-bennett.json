{"title": "Grim Smile Of The Five Towns", "description": "The Grim Smile of the Five Towns (1907) is the second major collection of stories written by Arnold Bennett. (The first is Tales Of The Five Towns, 1905, available at Librivox.).The five towns of the title are the conurbation of Stoke-on-Trent in which much of the writer's best work is set. Later [than initial] critics have been kinder to the collection's key story, with Margaret Drabble calling \"Simon Fuge\"... one of the greatest short stories in the English language\", and John Wain remarking that... \"it says as much as a novel, it says easily as much as a novel of a hundred thousand words could say on this theme\" and naming it... \"the best thing that Arnold Bennett ever did.\" The stories exhibit Bennett's usual dry wit and belie the word \"grim\" in the title.  - Summary by David Wales", "duration": 25170, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "263", "name": "Arnold Bennett"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/grim_smile_of_the_five_towns_2008_librivox/grimsmilefivetowns_2008.jpg", "copyright_year": "1907", "genres": ["Literary Fiction", "Single Author Collections"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "David Wales"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "David Wales"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "DaveC"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "DaveC"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "The Lion's Share", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/grim_smile_of_the_five_towns_2008_librivox/grimsmilefivetowns_01_bennett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1920}, {"section": 2, "title": "Baby's Bath", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/grim_smile_of_the_five_towns_2008_librivox/grimsmilefivetowns_02_bennett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1676}, {"section": 3, "title": "The Silent Brothers", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/grim_smile_of_the_five_towns_2008_librivox/grimsmilefivetowns_03_bennett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2107}, {"section": 4, "title": "The Nineteenth Hat", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/grim_smile_of_the_five_towns_2008_librivox/grimsmilefivetowns_04_bennett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1086}, {"section": 5, "title": "Vera's First Christmas Adventure", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/grim_smile_of_the_five_towns_2008_librivox/grimsmilefivetowns_05_bennett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1605}, {"section": 6, "title": "The Murder Of The Mandarin", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/grim_smile_of_the_five_towns_2008_librivox/grimsmilefivetowns_06_bennett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1678}, {"section": 7, "title": "Vera's Second Christmas Adventure", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/grim_smile_of_the_five_towns_2008_librivox/grimsmilefivetowns_07_bennett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1656}, {"section": 8, "title": "The Burglary", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/grim_smile_of_the_five_towns_2008_librivox/grimsmilefivetowns_08_bennett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1629}, {"section": 9, "title": "News Of The Engagement", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/grim_smile_of_the_five_towns_2008_librivox/grimsmilefivetowns_09_bennett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 728}, {"section": 10, "title": "Beginning The New Year", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/grim_smile_of_the_five_towns_2008_librivox/grimsmilefivetowns_10_bennett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1091}, {"section": 11, "title": "From One Generation To Another", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/grim_smile_of_the_five_towns_2008_librivox/grimsmilefivetowns_11_bennett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1550}, {"section": 12, "title": "The Death Of Simon Fuge, Part 1", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/grim_smile_of_the_five_towns_2008_librivox/grimsmilefivetowns_12_bennett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2564}, {"section": 13, "title": "The Death Of Simon Fuge, Part 2", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/grim_smile_of_the_five_towns_2008_librivox/grimsmilefivetowns_13_bennett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1676}, {"section": 14, "title": "The Death Of Simon Fuge, Part 3", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/grim_smile_of_the_five_towns_2008_librivox/grimsmilefivetowns_14_bennett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3517}, {"section": 15, "title": "In A New Bottle", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/grim_smile_of_the_five_towns_2008_librivox/grimsmilefivetowns_15_bennett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 687}]}
