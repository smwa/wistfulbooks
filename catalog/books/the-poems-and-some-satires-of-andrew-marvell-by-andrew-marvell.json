{"title": "Poems and Some Satires of Andrew Marvell", "description": "Andrew Marvell is a man of many faces, in both poetry and politics. A master of the pastoral dialogue, he can equally well fire out a Juvenalian satire; congratulate the new republic while also applauding the murdered king\u2019s fortitude; and balance a solemn platitude against a ribald joke within the space of two lines. This constitutional habit of seeing two sides of the same issue owes much to Ben Jonson\u2019s influence although the younger poet uses this talent to create irony like Donne\u2019s rather than for the appearance of frank honesty as in Jonson. In \u201cThe Garden\u201d he is as at home with sensory luxury as Herrick, but his paradoxes and metaphysical conceits, in \u201cThe Definition of Love,\u201d rival Donne\u2019s. One may suspect that the couplet form, especially in the satires, encourages this doubleness, for where the rhymes are muted it is not found, as in the straight pathos of the \u201cThe Nymph\u2019s Complaining for the Death of Her Fawn,\u201d enjambment obscuring rhymes by tending to make phrases end in the middle of lines rather than at line-end.\r\n\r\nIn the Satires, Marvell shifts from arch sneering to savage excoriation, and then to rollicking triple-rhythm burlesque. It seems at times that he must certainly be added to someone\u2019s hit list, but his insults are so brazen and he appears to have so much fun in making scandalous accusations that he appears to enjoy the immunity of a court jester.\r\n\r\n(Summary by Thomas A.
