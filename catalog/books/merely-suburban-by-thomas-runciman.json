{"title": "Merely Suburban", "description": "LibriVox volunteers bring you 9 recordings of Merely Suburban by Thomas Runciman.<br>\r\nThis was the Fortnightly Poetry project for  November 12, 2023.  <br> ------<br>\r\nHis poems were never offered for publication, although critical essays of his appeared from time to time, as for instance in the \"London\" of Henley and Stevenson. The Songs and Sonnets were written for his own satisfaction, and were sent to a few faithful friends and to members of his own family, who have allowed me to collect and print them.
