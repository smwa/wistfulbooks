{"title": "Dream of Gerontius (Version 2)", "description": "John Henry Newman was an English theologian, academic, writer and poet. Initially a Fellow of Oxford University, where he helped to found the Evangelical Oxford Movement, he later converted to Roman Catholicism and became a Cardinal.\r\n<BR><BR>\r\nThe Dream of Gerontius follows the journey of a man through death and purgatory to the sight of God. It has been described as a metrical meditation on death. It is more than that; it is the realization by means of a loving heart and a poetic imagination of the state of a just soul after death,\u2014Gerontius typifying not the soul of a particular person imagined by Cardinal Newman, but your soul, my soul, any soul which may be fortunate enough to satisfy the judging and merciful God. No poet has ever presented the condition of the soul, as made known by the theology of the Catholic Church, so forcibly and appealingly as Cardinal Newman.<BR><BR>\r\n\r\nThe Poem owes much of its imagery to Dante's Divine Comedy. It was adapted as a Choral Oratorio by Edward Elgar.\r\n<BR><BR>\r\n(Summary by Alan Mapstone and the Editor) \r\n<BR><BR>Cast List<BR><BR>\r\n\r\nGerontius: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/8425\">Larry Wilson</a>\r\nAssistants: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/7170\">Alan Mapstone</a>\r\nThe Priest: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/17662\">Inkell</a>\r\nAngel: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/19584\">ShrimpPhish</a>\r\nDemons: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/6754\">ToddHW</a>\r\nChoir of Angelicals: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/7170\">Alan Mapstone</a>\r\nAngels of the Sacred Stair: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/17713\">Brian Fullen</a>\r\nAngel of the Agony: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/18543\">Agnes Robert Behr</a>\r\nSouls in Purgatory: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/19612\">Jon Hunter</a>\r\nNarration: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/7170\">Alan Mapstone</a>", "duration": 3125, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "1632", "name": "John Henry Newman"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/thedreamofgerontius_2504_librivox/gerontius_2504.jpg", "copyright_year": "1910", "genres": ["Poetry", "Drama"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Alan Mapstone"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "ToddHW"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Alan Mapstone"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Introduction and Dramatis Personae", "readers": [7170], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/thedreamofgerontius_2504_librivox/dreamofgerontius_0_newman_64kb.mp3", "duration": 141}, {"section": 1, "title": "Part 1", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/thedreamofgerontius_2504_librivox/dreamofgerontius_1_newman_64kb.mp3", "duration": 653}, {"section": 2, "title": "Part 2", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/thedreamofgerontius_2504_librivox/dreamofgerontius_2_newman_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2331}]}
