{"title": "Poems of American History, Volume 4, The Civil War", "description": "This volume is a fascinating reflection on the Civil War years from a perspective in 1908, when many Civil War veterans were still alive, when the wounds to North and South were still fresh, and when no event more cataclysmic had struck the Republic than a Civil War that began less than 100 years after the Revolution for Independence.  Poets in this volume include: John Greenleaf Whittier, William Cullen Bryant, Herman Melville, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Bret Harte, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Walt Whitman, and Julia Ward Howe. - Summary by Ed Humpal", "duration": 39541, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "18", "name": " Various"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/poems_american_history_4_civil_war_1702_librivox/poems_of_american_history_IV_1702.jpg", "copyright_year": "1922", "genres": ["Poetry", "Modern (19th C)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Ed Humpal"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Ann Boulais"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Ed Humpal"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "The Battle Hymn of the Republic", "readers": [11242], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/poems_american_history_4_civil_war_1702_librivox/poemsofamericanhistory4_00_various_64kb.mp3", "duration": 149}, {"section": 1, "title": "The Slavery Question", "readers": [9393], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/poems_american_history_4_civil_war_1702_librivox/poemsofamericanhistory4_01_various_64kb.mp3", "duration": 4311}, {"section": 2, "title": "The Gauntlet", "readers": [5872], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/poems_american_history_4_civil_war_1702_librivox/poemsofamericanhistory4_02_various_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2548}, {"section": 3, "title": "The North Gets Its Lesson", "readers": [8677], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/poems_american_history_4_civil_war_1702_librivox/poemsofamericanhistory4_03_various_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3971}, {"section": 4, "title": "The Grand Army of the Potomac", "readers": [11242], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/poems_american_history_4_civil_war_1702_librivox/poemsofamericanhistory4_04_various_64kb.mp3", "duration": 4190}, {"section": 5, "title": "The War in the West", "readers": [11070], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/poems_american_history_4_civil_war_1702_librivox/poemsofamericanhistory4_05_various_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1985}, {"section": 6, "title": "The Coast and the River", "readers": [1649], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/poems_american_history_4_civil_war_1702_librivox/poemsofamericanhistory4_06_various_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3325}, {"section": 7, "title": "Emancipation", "readers": [8425], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/poems_american_history_4_civil_war_1702_librivox/poemsofamericanhistory4_07_various_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1087}, {"section": 8, "title": "The Grand Army's Second Campaign", "readers": [9642], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/poems_american_history_4_civil_war_1702_librivox/poemsofamericanhistory4_08_various_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3417}, {"section": 9, "title": "With Grant on the Mississippi", "readers": [8677], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/poems_american_history_4_civil_war_1702_librivox/poemsofamericanhistory4_09_various_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2728}, {"section": 10, "title": "The Final Struggle", "readers": [5872], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/poems_american_history_4_civil_war_1702_librivox/poemsofamericanhistory4_10_various_64kb.mp3", "duration": 4096}, {"section": 11, "title": "Winslow and Farragut", "readers": [8677], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/poems_american_history_4_civil_war_1702_librivox/poemsofamericanhistory4_11_various_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2603}, {"section": 12, "title": "The Martyr President", "readers": [8011], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/poems_american_history_4_civil_war_1702_librivox/poemsofamericanhistory4_12_various_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2023}, {"section": 13, "title": "Peace", "readers": [3645], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/poems_american_history_4_civil_war_1702_librivox/poemsofamericanhistory4_13_various_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3108}]}
