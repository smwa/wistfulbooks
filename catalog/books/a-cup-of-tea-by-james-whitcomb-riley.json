{"title": "Cup of Tea", "description": "James Whitcomb Riley was an American writer, poet, and best-selling author. During his lifetime he was known as the \"Hoosier Poet\" and \"Children's Poet\" for his dialect works and his children's poetry respectively. His poems tended to be humorous or sentimental, and of the approximately one thousand poems that Riley authored, the majority are in dialect. <br /><br />\nRiley's chief legacy was his influence in fostering the creation of a Midwestern cultural identity and his contributions to the Golden Age of Indiana Literature. Along with other writers of his era, he helped create a caricature of Midwesterners and formed a literary community that produced works rivaling the established eastern literati. There are many memorials dedicated to Riley, including the James Whitcomb Riley Hospital for Children.
