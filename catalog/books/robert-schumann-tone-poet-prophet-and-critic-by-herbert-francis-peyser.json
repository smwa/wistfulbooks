{"title": "Robert Schumann, Tone Poet Prophet And Critic", "description": "[This is] the sketchiest outline of Robert Schumann\u2019s short life but amazingly rich achievement. Together with Haydn and Schubert he was, perhaps, the most completely lovable of the great masters. It is hard, moreover, to think of a composer more strategically placed in his epoch or more perfectly timed in his coming. Tone poet, fantast, critic, visionary, prophet\u2014he was all of these! And he passed through every phase, it seemed, of romantic experience. The great and even the semi-great of a fabulous period of music were his intimates\u2014personages like Mendelssohn, Chopin, Liszt, Moscheles, Ferdinand David, Hiller, Joachim, Brahms. He won the woman he loved after a bitter struggle against a tyrannical father-in-law. He created much of the world\u2019s greatest piano music, many of its loveliest songs, four great symphonies, superb chamber compositions and a good deal else.
