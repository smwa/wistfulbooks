{"title": "More Goops and How Not to Be Them", "description": "Deep in the heart of every parent is the wish, the desire, to have other adults tell us, in an unsolicited way, just how very polite one\u2019s child is!  This perhaps was even more the case in 1903, when Gelett Burgess produced his second book on the Goops.  With entertaining cartoons - caricatures of misbehaving children - he described many different breaches of tact and good manners.<br /><br />Burgess wrote several books of poetry on the Goops, each poem describing some significant way in which an unthoughtful or unkind child could offend polite society and often offering the hope that the listener would never behave that way.  Ahem!  Well, perhaps very few people have succeeded in not acting Goop-like at some point in their lives, but read along with Burgess as he attempts to define, in a humorous fashion, exactly what the differences between \u201cGood\u201d and \u201cGoop\u201d are!<br />(Summary by Mark F.
