{"title": "Learned Women", "description": "Two young people, Henriette and Clitandre, are in love, but in order to marry, they must overcome an obstacle: the attitude of Henriette's family. Her sensible father and uncle are in favour of the marriage; but unfortunately her father is under the thumb of his wife, Philaminte, Henriette's mother. And Philaminte, supported by Henriette's aunt and sister, wishes her to marry Trissotin, a \"scholar\" and mediocre poet with lofty aspirations, who has these three women completely in his thrall. For these three ladies are \"learned\"; their obsession in life is learning and culture of the most pretentious kind, and Trissotin is their special prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and the fixture of their literary salon. - Summary by Wikipedia\n<BR><BR>Cast list:<BR>\nArmande: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/6281\">Beth Thomas</a><br>Henriette: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/6544\">Amanda Friday</a><br>Clitandre: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/7601\">Malone</a><br>Belise: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/7679\">Libby Gohn</a><br>Ariste: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/8784\">Kingof192</a><br>Chrysale: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/6754\">ToddHW</a><br>Martine: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/8009\">Frances Brown</a><br>Philaminte: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/8337\">Claudia Salto</a><br>Trissotin: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/474\">Zachary Brewster-Geisz</a><br>Lepine: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/7848\">bala</a><br>Vadius: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/8291\">Elliot Gage</a><br>Julian: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/8693\">russellhughes</a><br>A Notary: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/8435\">Richard Friday</a><br>Narrator: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/7708\">Savannah</a><br>Edited by <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/7026\">Michele Eaton</a>", "duration": 6309, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "6282", "name": " Moli\u00e8re"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt33/Learned_Women_1403.jpg", "copyright_year": "1672", "genres": ["Satire"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Amanda Friday"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Anna Simon"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Frances Brown"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Act 1", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/learned_women_1403_librivox/learnedwomen_01_moliere_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1029}, {"section": 2, "title": "Act 2", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/learned_women_1403_librivox/learnedwomen_02_moliere_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1324}, {"section": 3, "title": "Act 3", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/learned_women_1403_librivox/learnedwomen_03_moliere_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1619}, {"section": 4, "title": "Act 4", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/learned_women_1403_librivox/learnedwomen_04_moliere_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1241}, {"section": 5, "title": "Act 5", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/learned_women_1403_librivox/learnedwomen_05_moliere_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1096}]}
