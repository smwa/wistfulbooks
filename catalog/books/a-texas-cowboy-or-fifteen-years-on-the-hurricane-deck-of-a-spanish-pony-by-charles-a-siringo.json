{"title": "Texas Cowboy; Or Fifteen Years on the Hurricane Deck of a Spanish Pony", "description": "Charles A. Siringo was an American lawman, detective, and agent for the Pinkerton National Detective Agency during the late 19th century and early 20th century\u2026.  After taking part in several cattle drives, Siringo stopped herding to settle down, get married (1884), and open a merchant business in Caldwell, Kansas. He began writing a book, entitled A Texas Cowboy; Or Fifteen Years on the Hurricane Deck of a Spanish Pony. A year later, it was published, to wide acclaim, and became one of the first true looks into life as a cowboy written by someone who had actually lived the life.   \n - Summary by wikipedia and david wales", "duration": 22094, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "2578", "name": "Charles A.
