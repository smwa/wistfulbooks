{"title": "Thoughts on the Death Penalty", "description": "This 1845 publication, written by a prominent reformer of the day, argues against capital punishment from several perspectives, including historical, philosophical and biblical arguments. It is broken into 3 chapters: Expediency, Justice, and Sacred Scriptures (although it has Scripture references peppered throughout). Burleigh frequently references and argues against George B. Cheever, a prominent death penalty advocate of the time.<br /><br />\"If it shall thus be the means of helping on in a humble way the progress of that humane reform whose principles it advocates; and of hastening, however little, the coming of that time, when the penal statutes of a \"christian\" and \"civilized people,\" shall have ceased to be written in blood, I shall be richly repaid for the time and labor spent upon this task.\" (Summary by TriciaG and from the preface)", "duration": 22942, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "12636", "name": "Charles C.
