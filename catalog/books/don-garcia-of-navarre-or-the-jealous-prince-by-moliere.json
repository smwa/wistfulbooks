{"title": "Don Garcia of Navarre, or the Jealous Prince", "description": "Nothing can be more unlike The Pretentious Young Ladies or Sganarelle than Moli\u00e8re's Don Garcia of Navarre. The Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Palais-Royal had opened on the 20th January, 1661, with The Love-Tiff and Sganarelle, but as the young wife of Louis XIV., Maria Theresa, daughter of Philip IV., King of Spain, had only lately arrived, and as a taste for the Spanish drama appeared to spring up anew in France, Moli\u00e8re thought perhaps that a heroic comedy in that style might meet with some success, the more so as a company of Spanish actors had been performing in Paris the plays of Lope de Vega and Calderon, since the 24th of July, 1660. Therefore, he brought out, on the 4th of February, 1661, his new play of Don Garcia of Navarre. Moli\u00e8re wished to create a counterpart of Sganarelle, the type of ridiculous jealousy, and to delineate passionate jealousy, its doubts, fears, perplexities and anxieties, and in this he has succeeded admirably. \n - Summary by Translator Henri Van Laun\n<BR><BR>Cast list:<BR>\nDON GARCIA, Prince of Navarre, in love with Elvira: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/11585\">Kurt</a><br>\nDON ALPHONSO, Prince of Leon, thought to be Prince of Castile, under the name of Don Silvio: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/13577\">Adrian Stephens</a><br>\nDON ALVAREZ, confidant of Don Garcia, in love with Eliza: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/10789\">Tomas Peter</a><br>\nDON LOPEZ, another confidant of Don Garcia, in love with Eliza: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/7170\">alanmapstone</a><br>\nDON PEDRO, gentleman usher to Inez: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/8425\">Larry Wilson</a><br>\nDONNA ELVIRA, Princess of Leon: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/6924\">Rapunzelina</a><br>\nDONNA INEZ, a Countess, in love with Don Silvio, beloved by Mauregat, the usurper of the Kingdom of Leon: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/10179\">Sonia</a><br>\nELIZA, confidant to Elvira: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/11790\">TJ Burns</a><br>\nStage Directions and Editing: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/6754\">ToddHW</a>", "duration": 6686, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "6282", "name": " Moli\u00e8re"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/jealousprince_2003_librivox/don_garcia_2003.jpg", "copyright_year": "1682", "genres": ["Plays"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "ToddHW"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "ToddHW"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Sonia"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Act 1", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/jealousprince_2003_librivox/jealousprince_1_moliere_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1448}, {"section": 2, "title": "Act 2", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/jealousprince_2003_librivox/jealousprince_2_moliere_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1265}, {"section": 3, "title": "Act 3", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/jealousprince_2003_librivox/jealousprince_3_moliere_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1158}, {"section": 4, "title": "Act 4", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/jealousprince_2003_librivox/jealousprince_4_moliere_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1539}, {"section": 5, "title": "Act 5", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/jealousprince_2003_librivox/jealousprince_5_moliere_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1276}]}
