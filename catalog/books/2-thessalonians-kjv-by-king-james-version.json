{"title": "Bible (KJV) NT 14: 2 Thessalonians", "description": "The Second Epistle of Paul to the Thessalonians, often referred to as Second Thessalonians and written 2 Thessalonians, is a book from the New Testament of the Christian Bible.<br><br>The traditional view is that the second epistle to the Thessalonians was probably written from Corinth not many months after the first. Apparently the first letter was misunderstood, especially regarding the second advent of Christ. The Thessalonians had embraced the idea that Paul had taught that \"the day of Christ was at hand\", that Christ's coming was about to occur. This error is corrected (2:1-12), and the apostle announces what first must take place before the end times. The \"Great Apostasy\" is first mentioned here as is the \"Katechon\".<br><br>A passage from this book reading \"For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat\", (2 Thess. 3:10), was later adapted by Vladimir Lenin as an adage of the Soviet Union, He who does not work, neither shall he eat.
