{"title": "Four Months in a Sneak-Box", "description": "The kind reception by the American press of the author's first journey to the great southern sea, and its republication in Great Britain and in France ... have encouraged him to give the public a companion volume, \"FOUR MONTHS IN A SNEAK-BOX\" ... a relation of ... a second cruise to the Gulf of Mexico ... by a different route from that followed in the \"VOYAGE OF THE PAPER CANOE.\"  This time the author procured one of the smallest and most comfortable of boats... the BARNEGAT SNEAK-BOX. This curious and stanch little craft, though only twelve feet in length, proved a most comfortable and serviceable home while the author rowed in it more than 2600 miles down the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, and along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, until he reached the goal of his voyage \u2014 the mouth of the wild Suwanee River \u2014 which was the terminus of his \"VOYAGE OF THE PAPER CANOE.\" - Summary by Nathaniel H. Bishop<br><br>\r\nNOTE: There are issues of race in the telling of \"Four Months in a Sneak-box\", particularly anti-Black stereotypes and derogatory terms.
