{"title": "Milton's Minor Poems", "description": "\u201cOn Shakespear 1630\u201d typifies much of Milton\u2019s poetry. By some miracle never yet explained, at age 24 he managed to get a 16-line encomium included in the Second Folio of the Bard\u2019s collected works, 1632. Quite a coup! And this brand new M.A., never before published, used this brief poem to contradict Shakespeare\u2019s chief rival, the great Ben Jonson, whose 80-line panegyric had graced the First Folio eleven years earlier. Jonson had said that Shakespeare\u2019s monument was this living book, but Milton says, no, it is rather the readers who, stunned by the poet\u2019s verse, become living statues in his honor.<br>\n\nYou will find the same audacity here in the minor poems as in Paradise Lost, which treats of \u201cthings unattempted yet in prose of rime.\u201d You can hear it in the college student\u2019s satirical invitation (likely to the classmate next on the program) \u201cRivers arise . . . ,\u201d a travesty of the epic catalogue of rivers; and in his affectionately irreverent epitaph on Hobson (of \u201cHobson\u2019s choice\u201d), the stage coach driver for the boys of Cambridge; and again in a second epitaph on the same subject but offering a shameless burlesque of \u201cMetaphysical\u201d conceits. Even in his paraphrase of Psalm VII, where he takes issue with the King James Version on two points of grammar at the end of the second stanza, he is clearly the man who will write \u201cHow few somtimes may know, when thousands err.\u201d<br>\n\nYet for all Milton\u2019s iconoclasm, he knows discipline. Some of the later sonnets undertake topics, express attitudes, and employ metrical devices which, by straining the delicate sonnet form almost\u2014but not quite\u2014to the breaking point, create such power as was never before borne by any sonnet. Such is the power of poetic discipline wedded to poetic genius.<br>\n\nBut it is in \u201cLycidas\u201d that Milton faces the ultimate test of inspiration vs. authority. He piles into the poem every known convention of the pastoral elegy form and even drags in by the heels St. Peter, who, as father of the Church, was a pastor, and these provide the cage within which he must work. Yet he brings them to life with such convincing shifts of sentiment\u2014blaming, wishful thinking, savage resentment, brave facing of the truth, and finally acceptance\u2014that they cease to be confining; sincerity transmutes his cage into his language, sincerity belying artifice.
