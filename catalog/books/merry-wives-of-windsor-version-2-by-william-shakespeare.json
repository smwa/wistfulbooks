{"title": "Merry Wives of Windsor (version 2)", "description": "After the character\u2019s colorful exploits proved a rousing success in <a href=\"https://librivox.org/first-part-king-henry-iv-version-2-by-william-shakespeare/\"><i>Henry IV, Part 1</i></a> and <a href=\"https://librivox.org/second-part-king-henry-iv-version-2-by-william-shakespeare/\"><i>Henry IV, Part 2</i></a>, William Shakespeare brought back the roguish knight Sir John Falstaff for one last adventure in <i>The Merry Wives of Windsor</i>, which is notable for being the only play he wrote that is set in his contemporary Elizabethan England. While sojourning in Windsor with his miscreant retinue, Falstaff devises a new get-rich-quick scheme by trying to woo two wealthy merchant wives, the Mistresses Page and Ford. His fatal mistake? Sending both women identical love letters! When his ruse is discovered, the crafty ladies join forces to subject the rotund reprobate to a series of humiliating pranks as a way of teaching him a lesson, while also stringing along Mistress Ford\u2019s terminally jealous husband for good measure. In the secondary plot, the Pages\u2019 young daughter, Anne, is courted by several suitors, including Justice Shallow\u2019s pretentious cousin and an irascible French doctor. However, her preferred lover, Fenton, does not have her father\u2019s approval, leading to much parental meddling and daughterly disobedience. Will Anne and Fenton succeed in remaining together? Will Falstaff finally learn the error of his ways? And just how far will the Mistresses Page and Ford go to exact revenge on the undisciplined men in their lives? The answers may surprise you!<br><br>And to perform it all?
