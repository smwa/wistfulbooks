{"title": "Golden mean to 5000 digits", "description": "The golden section is a line segment sectioned into two according to the golden ratio. The total length a+b is to the longer segment a as a is to the shorter segment b. In mathematics and the arts, two quantities are in the golden ratio if the ratio between the sum of those quantities and the larger one is the same as the ratio between the larger one and the smaller. The golden ratio is a mathematical constant, approximately 1.6180339887.... <br /><br />At least since the Renaissance, many artists and architects have proportioned their works to approximate the golden ratio\u2014especially in the form of the golden rectangle, in which the ratio of the longer side to the shorter is the golden ratio\u2014believing this proportion to be aesthetically pleasing. Mathematicians have studied the golden ratio because of its unique and interesting properties.
