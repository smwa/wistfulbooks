{"title": "Frozen North", "description": "It is in this world that Mayde has created his fascinating The Frozen North: \"Great as are the barren grounds, or tundri, as they are called in Siberia, the arctic forest region is far greater, for it reaches around the globe in a broad belt, nearly a thousand miles in width. Few indeed are the occupants of these great tracts, compared with the more favored southern lands. The poverty of the soil, and the severity of the climate, prevent the growth of crops, and man is offered only such subsistence as can be gained by hunting and fishing. In consequence they are inhabited but by scattered tribes of savages and by hardy trappers, who brave their dangers for the rich booty to be gained from their many fur-bearing animals.\" (from Chapter 1)", "duration": 3575, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "13487", "name": "Richard Mayde"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/frozen_north_2009_librivox/frozen_north_2009.jpg", "copyright_year": "1876", "genres": ["Nature", "Travel & Geography"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Jim Locke"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Jim Locke"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "DaveC"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "DaveC"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Chapter 1", "readers": [10801], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/frozen_north_2009_librivox/frozennorth_01_mayde_64kb.mp3", "duration": 855}, {"section": 2, "title": "Chapter 2", "readers": [10801], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/frozen_north_2009_librivox/frozennorth_02_mayde_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1162}, {"section": 3, "title": "Chapter 3", "readers": [10801], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/frozen_north_2009_librivox/frozennorth_03_mayde_64kb.mp3", "duration": 664}, {"section": 4, "title": "Chapter 4", "readers": [10801], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/frozen_north_2009_librivox/frozennorth_04_mayde_64kb.mp3", "duration": 894}]}
