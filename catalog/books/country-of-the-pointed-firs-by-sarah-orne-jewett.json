{"title": "Country of the Pointed Firs", "description": "The Country of the Pointed Firs (1896) is considered Jewett\u2019s finest work, described by Henry James as her \u201cbeautiful little quantum of achievement.\u201d Despite James\u2019s diminutives, the novel remains a classic. Because it is loosely structured, many critics view the book not as a novel, but a series of sketches; however, its structure is unified through both setting and theme. Jewett herself felt that her strengths as a writer lay not in plot development or dramatic tension, but in character development. Indeed, she determined early in her career to preserve a disappearing way of life, and her novel can be read as a study of the effects of isolation and hardship on the inhabitants who lived in the decaying fishing villages along the Maine coast.<br />\n(summary from Gutenberg e-text)", "duration": 15923, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "1685", "name": "Sarah Orne Jewett"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/pointed_firs/Country_Pointed_Firs_1104.jpg", "copyright_year": "1896", "genres": ["General Fiction"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Betsie Bush"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Betsie Bush"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "The Return / Mrs. Todd", "readers": [32], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/pointed_firs/country_of_pointed_firs_01-02_jewett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 680}, {"section": 2, "title": "The Schoolhouse", "readers": [19], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/pointed_firs/country_of_pointed_firs_03_jewett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 335}, {"section": 3, "title": "At the Schoolhouse Window", "readers": [19], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/pointed_firs/country_of_pointed_firs_04_jewett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 403}, {"section": 4, "title": "Captain Littlepage", "readers": [398], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/pointed_firs/country_of_pointed_firs_05_jewett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 859}, {"section": 5, "title": "The Waiting Place", "readers": [569], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/pointed_firs/country_of_pointed_firs_06_jewett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 836}, {"section": 6, "title": "The Outer Island", "readers": [137], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/pointed_firs/country_of_pointed_firs_07_jewett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 417}, {"section": 7, "title": "Green Island", "readers": [36], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/pointed_firs/country_of_pointed_firs_08_jewett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1318}, {"section": 8, "title": "William", "readers": [712], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/pointed_firs/country_of_pointed_firs_09_jewett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 418}, {"section": 9, "title": "Where Pennyroyal Grew", "readers": [19], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/pointed_firs/country_of_pointed_firs_10_jewett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 650}, {"section": 10, "title": "The Old Singers", "readers": [98], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/pointed_firs/country_of_pointed_firs_11_jewett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 484}, {"section": 11, "title": "A Strange Sail", "readers": [203], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/pointed_firs/country_of_pointed_firs_12_jewett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 824}, {"section": 12, "title": "Poor Joanna", "readers": [203], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/pointed_firs/country_of_pointed_firs_13_jewett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1215}, {"section": 13, "title": "The Hermitage", "readers": [203], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/pointed_firs/country_of_pointed_firs_14_jewett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 854}, {"section": 14, "title": "On Shell-heap Island", "readers": [203], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/pointed_firs/country_of_pointed_firs_15_jewett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 478}, {"section": 15, "title": "The Great Expedition", "readers": [98], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/pointed_firs/country_of_pointed_firs_16_jewett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 760}, {"section": 16, "title": "A Country Road", "readers": [203], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/pointed_firs/country_of_pointed_firs_17_jewett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 822}, {"section": 17, "title": "The Bowden Reunion", "readers": [712], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/pointed_firs/country_of_pointed_firs_18_jewett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1588}, {"section": 18, "title": "The Feast\u2019s End", "readers": [203], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/pointed_firs/country_of_pointed_firs_19_jewett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 711}, {"section": 19, "title": "Along Shore", "readers": [32], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/pointed_firs/country_of_pointed_firs_20_jewett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1711}, {"section": 20, "title": "The Backward View", "readers": [32], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/pointed_firs/country_of_pointed_firs_21_jewett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 560}]}
