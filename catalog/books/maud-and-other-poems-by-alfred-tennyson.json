{"title": "Maud, and Other Poems (Version 2)", "description": "Surely everyone knows \u201cMaud\u201d? Isn\u2019t that the Victorian love song, where the man waits by the garden gate for his lover to appear for a secret rendezvous? Well, that may be the song, but Tennyson\u2019s poem is longer and very much darker. It deals not with love but with the obsession of an unstable young man with the seventeen-year-old Maud, and his gradual descent into madness.\n\nThe poem\u2019s narrator has been excluded from an evening ball being held at Maud\u2019s home, The Hall, and has climbed into her garden uninvited, convincing himself by a misreading the Language of Flowers that she has sent him a love-token in the form of a rose blossom. After the guests have left, Maud and her brother step out into the dawn, and soon the brother is lying mortally wounded at the narrator\u2019s hand. He flees abroad, and later loses his reason after hearing of Maud\u2019s own death. Finally, the narrator insists that he has at last recovered from his \u201cold hysterical mock-disease\u201d and has awakened to a better mind, fighting for his country in the Crimean War. But can he be believed? Many early reviewers took the narrator as stating the poet's own views on war, but Tennyson himself responded that he would hardly have chosen a narrator with an \"hereditary vein of insanity\" to represent his personal opinions.\n\nThe collection includes several other well-known Tennyson poems, including \u201cThe Brook, an Idyl\u201d, and \u201cThe Charge of the Light Brigade\u201d.
