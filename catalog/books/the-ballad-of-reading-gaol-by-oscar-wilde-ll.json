{"title": "Ballad of Reading Gaol, (version 2)", "description": "In 1895, Oscar Wilde was sentenced to 2 years of hard labor for acts of \u2018gross indecency\u2019. During his time at Reading Gaol, he witnessed a rare hanging, and in the three years between his release and his untimely death in 1900, was inspired to write the following poem, a meditation on the death penalty and the importance of forgiveness, even for (and especially for) something as heinous as murdering one\u2019s spouse; for even the murderer, Wilde argues, is human and suffers more so for being the cause of his own pain, for \u2018having killed the thing he loved\u2019; for everyone is the cause of someone else\u2019s suffering and suffers at the hands of another. It is this that Jesus Christ could see; he could continue to see the beauty of our humanity, despite all that we may do to each other, and encouraged us to love each other just the same<br /><br />\n \u201cThe Ballad of Reading Gaol\u201d was published in 1898 and would gain Wilde greater recognition as a poet (in addition to being a great playwright); although his only other volume of poetry, one of his earliest works that he\u2019d published, was also well-received. Sadly, \u2018The Ballad\u2019 would be his last.<br />(Summary by Linda Leu).", "duration": 2571, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "114", "name": "Oscar Wilde"}], "coverArt": "http://archive.org/download/ballad_of_reading_gaol_ll_librivox/Ballad_Reading_Gaol_V2_1105.jpg", "copyright_year": "1897", "genres": ["Poetry"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Linda Leu"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Linda Leu"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "David Barnes"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "The Ballad of Reading Gaol", "readers": [102], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/ballad_of_reading_gaol_ll_librivox/balladofreadinggaol_ll_wilde_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2571}]}
