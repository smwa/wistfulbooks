{"title": "With The Royal Army Medical Corps in Egypt", "description": "Throughout the First World War, members of the Royal Army Medical Corps provided constant support for British and Allied military troops whether they were fighting on the frontline or engaged in other operations within all areas of the conflict. \n\nWith the Great War continuing unabated and the battlefront extending through Europe into the Middle East and beyond, a rapid increase in military medical support facilities and infrastructure was urgently implemented to handle the ever increasing number of wounded, maimed and sick troops evacuated from the combat zone that needed to receive urgent medical and life-saving care. \n\nCommandeering and requisitioning suitable buildings and facilities for the purpose, the British and Allied forces increased the number of hospital beds available from just a few hundred to many thousands. But these were barely sufficient to cope, when you consider that within a few days of the first fateful landings on the Gallipoli Peninsula in April 1915, the wounded began to pour into Egypt. In the first ten days alone no fewer than 16,000 cases were landed and distributed among the hospitals ashore.\n\nPublished in 1918, this book is the personal memoir of Tickner Edwardes who was an operating theatre orderly based in Egypt during the First World War. In it, he brings his uniquely perceptive and eloquent writing style to document the roles and responsibilities undertaken by the R.A.M.C. in Egypt to maintain the health, welfare and well-being of all personnel in whatever field of operations they were engaged in. - Summary by Steve C", "duration": 39856, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "11276", "name": "Tickner Edwardes"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/with_the_royal_army_medical_corps_1903_librivox/ramc_egypt_1903.jpg", "copyright_year": "1918", "genres": ["War & Military", "Memoirs"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Steve C"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Steve C"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "DaveC"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "DaveC"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Preface", "readers": [7389], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/with_the_royal_army_medical_corps_1903_librivox/withtheramcinegypt_00_edwardes_64kb.mp3", "duration": 242}, {"section": 1, "title": "Chapter 1 - Retrospect", "readers": [7389], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/with_the_royal_army_medical_corps_1903_librivox/withtheramcinegypt_01_edwardes_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1506}, {"section": 2, "title": "Chapter 2 - Egypt And The Great War - Part 1", "readers": [7389], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/with_the_royal_army_medical_corps_1903_librivox/withtheramcinegypt_02_edwardes_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2722}, {"section": 3, "title": "Chapter 2 - Egypt And The Great War - Part 2", "readers": [7389], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/with_the_royal_army_medical_corps_1903_librivox/withtheramcinegypt_03_edwardes_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2210}, {"section": 4, "title": "Chapter 3 - ''The Long, Long Way To Achi Baba''", "readers": [7389], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/with_the_royal_army_medical_corps_1903_librivox/withtheramcinegypt_04_edwardes_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2218}, {"section": 5, "title": "Chapter 4 - The R.A.M.C.
