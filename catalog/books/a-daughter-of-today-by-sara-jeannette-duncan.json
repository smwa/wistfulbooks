{"title": "Daughter of Today", "description": "The Canadian author Sara Jeannette Duncan (aka Mrs. Everard Cotes) is today best known for her 1904 novel of Ontario life, \u201cThe Imperialist\u201d (also available as a LibriVox recording), but in Duncan\u2019s own time readers were impressed more by her other works, including \u201cA Daughter of Today,\u201d published in 1894. \n\n\u201cA Daughter of Today\u201d follows the story of Elfrida Bell, a young woman who escapes the American Midwest to pursue first an artistic education in Paris, and then a novice career in journalism in London. As the novel\u2019s title indicates, Elfrida is a product \u201cof today,\u201d i.e., of her day \u2014 the 1890s. She is swept up in the heady notions of that period: Aestheticism (\u201cart for art\u2019s sake\u201d), fin-de-si\u00e8cle Decadence, and ideas about the \u201cNew Woman\u201d who breaks free of bourgeois conventions. With the self-absorption of youth, Elfrida sets about constructing herself along these lines. She pursues this project with bracing energy, mixed with pretension and affectation: \u201cIn nothing that she said or did, admired or condemned, was there any trace of the commonplace, except, perhaps, the desire to avoid it.\u201d Early reviewers debated whether the character of Elfrida was \u201cfresh and original,\u201d or simply \u201cill-bred.\u201d \n\nThis novel explores clashes between convention and originality, cultural differences (American /French /British), and rivalry between friends.  - Summary by Bruce Pirie", "duration": 37063, "language": "English", "authors":
