{"title": "Don Quixote", "description": "Madison Julius Cawein was born in Louisville, Kentucky. After graduating from high school, Cawein worked in a pool hall in Louisville as a cashier in Waddill's New-market, which also served as a gambling house. He worked there for six years, saving his pay so he could return home to write.\nHis output was thirty-six books and 1,500 poems. His writing presented Kentucky scenes in a language echoing Percy Bysshe Shelley and John Keats. He soon earned the nickname the \"Keats of Kentucky\".<br /><br />\n\nNote: In Greek mythology, Hippocrene was the name of a spring on Mt. Helicon. It was sacred to the Muses and was formed by the hooves of Pegasus. Its name literally translates as \"Horse's Fountain\" and the water was supposed to bring forth poetic inspiration when imbibed. - Summary by Wikipedia", "duration": 1102, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "22", "name": "Madison Cawein"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/don_quixote_1505.poem_librivox/donquixote_1506.jpg", "copyright_year": "1915", "genres": ["Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Don Quixote - Read by ALP", "readers": [4705], "path": "https://archive.org/download/don_quixote_1505.poem_librivox/donquixote_cawein_alp_64kb.mp3", "duration": 68}, {"section": 2, "title": "Don Quixote - Read by BMS", "readers": [10071], "path": "https://archive.org/download/don_quixote_1505.poem_librivox/donquixote_cawein_bms_64kb.mp3", "duration": 76}, {"section": 3, "title": "Don Quixote - Read by CB", "readers": [9862], "path": "https://archive.org/download/don_quixote_1505.poem_librivox/donquixote_cawein_cb_64kb.mp3", "duration": 65}, {"section": 4, "title": "Don Quixote - Read by CLP", "readers": [9642], "path": "https://archive.org/download/don_quixote_1505.poem_librivox/donquixote_cawein_clp_64kb.mp3", "duration": 65}, {"section": 5, "title": "Don Quixote - Read by DL", "readers": [2911], "path": "https://archive.org/download/don_quixote_1505.poem_librivox/donquixote_cawein_dl_64kb.mp3", "duration": 72}, {"section": 6, "title": "Don Quixote - Read by EL", "readers": [9872], "path": "https://archive.org/download/don_quixote_1505.poem_librivox/donquixote_cawein_el_64kb.mp3", "duration": 71}, {"section": 7, "title": "Don Quixote - Read by FS", "readers": [6735], "path": "https://archive.org/download/don_quixote_1505.poem_librivox/donquixote_cawein_fs_64kb.mp3", "duration": 77}, {"section": 8, "title": "Don Quixote - Read by GG", "readers": [8011], "path": "https://archive.org/download/don_quixote_1505.poem_librivox/donquixote_cawein_gg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 88}, {"section": 9, "title": "Don Quixote - Read by JM", "readers": [9902], "path": "https://archive.org/download/don_quixote_1505.poem_librivox/donquixote_cawein_jm_64kb.mp3", "duration": 72}, {"section": 10, "title": "Don Quixote - Read by LAH", "readers": [1212], "path": "https://archive.org/download/don_quixote_1505.poem_librivox/donquixote_cawein_lah_64kb.mp3", "duration": 70}, {"section": 11, "title": "Don Quixote - Read by LCW", "readers": [8425], "path": "https://archive.org/download/don_quixote_1505.poem_librivox/donquixote_cawein_lcw_64kb.mp3", "duration": 69}, {"section": 12, "title": "Don Quixote - Read by LLW", "readers": [4738], "path": "https://archive.org/download/don_quixote_1505.poem_librivox/donquixote_cawein_llw_64kb.mp3", "duration": 82}, {"section": 13, "title": "Don Quixote - Read by MK", "readers": [8051], "path": "https://archive.org/download/don_quixote_1505.poem_librivox/donquixote_cawein_mk_64kb.mp3", "duration": 79}, {"section": 14, "title": "Don Quixote - Read by NB", "readers": [6965], "path": "https://archive.org/download/don_quixote_1505.poem_librivox/donquixote_cawein_nb_64kb.mp3", "duration": 76}, {"section": 15, "title": "Don Quixote - Read by WT", "readers": [5694], "path": "https://archive.org/download/don_quixote_1505.poem_librivox/donquixote_cawein_wt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 74}]}
