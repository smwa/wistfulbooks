{"title": "Golden Canyon", "description": "In August, 1856, times were hard in San Diego. Dick, who worked on the ship, \"Northampton\", was attacked by a ruthless gang - the next morning he found that his ship had sailed off without him. In no time, his closest friends came to him and nursed him back to health. In talking about the events, they decided it was time for a change, to make a better life for themselves, and that meant they would plan to leave and travel together in the quest to find gold in the \"Gold Canyon\". Along the way, they find themselves on the most dangerous adventure they will ever encounter in their lifetime, which includes a whole lot of \"the unexpected\" throughout the journey, and meeting up with savagely brutal Apache's. Will there be casualties in this quest? And does there really exist a \"Golden Canyon\"? A quick paced action adventure awaits!
