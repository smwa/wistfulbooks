The name Judith is the feminine form of Judah.  - Summary modified from wikipedia", "duration": 3780, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "950", "name": " King James Version (KJV)"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/bookofjudith_2007_librivox/KJVJudith_2007.jpg", "copyright_year": "0", "genres": ["King James Version"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "ancientchristian"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "ancientchristian"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Linette Geisel"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Linette Geisel"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Chapters 1-5", "readers": [14072], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/bookofjudith_2007_librivox/bookofjudith_01_kjv_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1003}, {"section": 2, "title": "Chapters 6-10", "readers": [14072], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/bookofjudith_2007_librivox/bookofjudith_02_kjv_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1418}, {"section": 3, "title": "Chapters 11-16", "readers": [14072], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/bookofjudith_2007_librivox/bookofjudith_03_kjv_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1359}]}
