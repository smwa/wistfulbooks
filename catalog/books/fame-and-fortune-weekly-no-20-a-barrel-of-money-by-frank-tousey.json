{"title": "Fame and Fortune Weekly No. 20: A Barrel of Money", "description": "Bertie Ballister, an honest and hard-working messenger boy for a banker on Wall Street, never lets the issues of his life get in the way of success. Though his father died when he was young, and his impoverished mother turned away by his affluent brother, he followed her lead to seek opportunities to better their lives. Not only does he seek advancement monitarily for himself, he seeks the financial stability of those dear to him. His great nerve is the salvation of his allies and the downfall of his enemies, even when one was the distainful uncle who previously wished his demise.
