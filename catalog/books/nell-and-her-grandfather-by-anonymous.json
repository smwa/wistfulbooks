{"title": "Nell and Her Grandfather", "description": "If you have heard of the Dickens novel, The Old Curiosity Shop, and remember Nell Trent, the beautiful and virtuous young girl of \"not quite fourteen\", an orphan, who lived with her maternal grandfather in his shop of odds and ends, then you will understand that these stories take place in the same time period as the book and have the same lovable and quirky characters. Not written by Dickens, of course, they try and succeed in my mind to carry on our enjoyment of hearing of the escapades of the people and England we love. - Summary by Phil Chenevert", "duration": 7868, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "19", "name": " Anonymous"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/librivoxcCDCoverArt35/nellgrandfather_1607.jpg", "copyright_year": "1908", "genres": ["Published 1900 onward"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Linette Geisel"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "The Old Curiosity Shop", "readers": [5717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/nellandhergrandfather_1607_librivox/nellandhergrandfather_01_anonymous_64kb.mp3", "duration": 943}, {"section": 2, "title": "Driven from Home", "readers": [5796], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/nellandhergrandfather_1607_librivox/nellandhergrandfather_02_anonymous_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1044}, {"section": 3, "title": "In the Open Country", "readers": [10159], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/nellandhergrandfather_1607_librivox/nellandhergrandfather_03_anonymous_64kb.mp3", "duration": 764}, {"section": 4, "title": "The Village School", "readers": [6754], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/nellandhergrandfather_1607_librivox/nellandhergrandfather_04_anonymous_64kb.mp3", "duration": 693}, {"section": 5, "title": "The Caravan", "readers": [10244], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/nellandhergrandfather_1607_librivox/nellandhergrandfather_05_anonymous_64kb.mp3", "duration": 456}, {"section": 6, "title": "The Wax-work Show", "readers": [10159], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/nellandhergrandfather_1607_librivox/nellandhergrandfather_06_anonymous_64kb.mp3", "duration": 613}, {"section": 7, "title": "Nell the Bread-Winner", "readers": [10261], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/nellandhergrandfather_1607_librivox/nellandhergrandfather_07_anonymous_64kb.mp3", "duration": 395}, {"section": 8, "title": "Trouble for Nell", "readers": [10261], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/nellandhergrandfather_1607_librivox/nellandhergrandfather_08_anonymous_64kb.mp3", "duration": 624}, {"section": 9, "title": "Flying from Temptation", "readers": [10261], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/nellandhergrandfather_1607_librivox/nellandhergrandfather_09_anonymous_64kb.mp3", "duration": 543}, {"section": 10, "title": "A Bed of Ashes", "readers": [6754], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/nellandhergrandfather_1607_librivox/nellandhergrandfather_10_anonymous_64kb.mp3", "duration": 711}, {"section": 11, "title": "A Friend in Need", "readers": [10244], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/nellandhergrandfather_1607_librivox/nellandhergrandfather_11_anonymous_64kb.mp3", "duration": 510}, {"section": 12, "title": "Peace after Storm", "readers": [10855], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/nellandhergrandfather_1607_librivox/nellandhergrandfather_12_anonymous_64kb.mp3", "duration": 572}]}
