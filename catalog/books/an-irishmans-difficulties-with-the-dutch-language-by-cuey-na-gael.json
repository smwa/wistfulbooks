{"title": "Irishman's difficulties with the Dutch language", "description": "Jack O'Neill, an Irishman, has just returned from a month's holiday in The Netherlands. Before he left, he had boasted to his friends that he would learn the Dutch language within a fortnight. On his return, he has to admit that it wasn't quite that easy... He tells his friends stories about his clumsy attempts to speak Dutch, leading to many funny scenes.<BR>This audiobook contains both \"An Irishman's difficulties with the Dutch language\" and its sequel \"Jack O'Neill's further adventures in Holland\".<BR><BR>N.B. Audiobook read by native Dutch woman, so there is no Irish accent of the English language bits, and the Dutch is done in native Dutch pronunciation (except where the text asks for mispronunciation).
