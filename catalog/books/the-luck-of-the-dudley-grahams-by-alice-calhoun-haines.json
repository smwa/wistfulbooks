{"title": "Luck of the Dudley Grahams", "description": "The Luck of the Dudley Grahams is the story of the four Graham children and their recently widowed mother, trying to make ends meet by taking boarders into their somewhat eccentric home, as told by 17-year-old Elizabeth to her diary. She chronicles their struggles with the boarders, housekeeping on a very tight budget, and the adventures of her three younger siblings. If the category existed at the time, this would be more of young adult novel than a children's book, as Elizabeth has her moments of angst and worry about herself, her family, and their future. - Summary by Colleen McMahon", "duration": 16056, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "13612", "name": "Alice Calhoun Haines"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/the_luck_of_the_dudley_grahams_1902_librivox/luck_dudley_grahams_1902.jpg", "copyright_year": "1907", "genres": ["Family Life", "General"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Colleen McMahon"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Colleen McMahon"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "DaveC"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Jennifer Dallman"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "November 26 - November 30", "readers": [11715], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_luck_of_the_dudley_grahams_1902_librivox/luckofthedudleygrahams_01_haines_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1130}, {"section": 2, "title": "December 1 - December 3", "readers": [11715], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_luck_of_the_dudley_grahams_1902_librivox/luckofthedudleygrahams_02_haines_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1632}, {"section": 3, "title": "December 5 - December 8", "readers": [11715], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_luck_of_the_dudley_grahams_1902_librivox/luckofthedudleygrahams_03_haines_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1070}, {"section": 4, "title": "December 10 - December 13", "readers": [11715], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_luck_of_the_dudley_grahams_1902_librivox/luckofthedudleygrahams_04_haines_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1892}, {"section": 5, "title": "December 15 - December 20", "readers": [11715], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_luck_of_the_dudley_grahams_1902_librivox/luckofthedudleygrahams_05_haines_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1514}, {"section": 6, "title": "December 22 - January 1", "readers": [11715], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_luck_of_the_dudley_grahams_1902_librivox/luckofthedudleygrahams_06_haines_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1784}, {"section": 7, "title": "January 5 - January 16", "readers": [11715], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_luck_of_the_dudley_grahams_1902_librivox/luckofthedudleygrahams_07_haines_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1302}, {"section": 8, "title": "January 21 - February 6", "readers": [11715], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_luck_of_the_dudley_grahams_1902_librivox/luckofthedudleygrahams_08_haines_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1558}, {"section": 9, "title": "February 11 - February 14", "readers": [11715], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_luck_of_the_dudley_grahams_1902_librivox/luckofthedudleygrahams_09_haines_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1645}, {"section": 10, "title": "February 17 - March 22", "readers": [11715], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_luck_of_the_dudley_grahams_1902_librivox/luckofthedudleygrahams_10_haines_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1097}, {"section": 11, "title": "April 5 - April 18", "readers": [11715], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_luck_of_the_dudley_grahams_1902_librivox/luckofthedudleygrahams_11_haines_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1432}]}
