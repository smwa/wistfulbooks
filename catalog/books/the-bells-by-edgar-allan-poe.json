{"title": "Bells", "description": "LibriVox readers bring you 18 recordings of \"The Bells.\" This was the Fortnightly Poetry selection for January 30 to February 13, 2011. <br/><br/>\n\n\"The Bells\" is a heavily onomatopoeic poem by Edgar Allan Poe which was not published until after his death in 1849. It is perhaps best known for the diacopic repetition of the word \"bells.\" The poem has four parts to it; each part becomes darker and darker as the poem progresses from \"the jingling and the tinkling\" of the bells in part 1 to the \"moaning and the groaning\" of the bells in part 4.
