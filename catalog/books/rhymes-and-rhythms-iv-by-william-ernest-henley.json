A fixture in London literary circles, the one-legged Henley might have been the inspiration for Robert Louis Stevenson's character Long John Silver (Treasure Island, 1883), while his young daughter Margaret Henley inspired J. M. Barrie's choice of the name Wendy for the heroine of his play Peter Pan (1904). \r\nThis Weekly poem is section 4 of Rhymes And Rhythms taken from POEMS By WILLIAM ERNEST HENLEY. - Summary by Wikipedia", "duration": 1343, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "1607", "name": "William Ernest Henley"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/rhymes_and_rhythms_iv_2304.poem_librivox/rhymesrthythms_2304.jpg", "copyright_year": "1907", "genres": ["Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "David Lawrence"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Rhymes And Rhythms IV -
