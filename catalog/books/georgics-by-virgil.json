{"title": "Georgics", "description": "Virgil's Georgics are the second of the three major poetic works ascribed to the poet. It was published probably around 29 BC and, as the name suggests, the subject of the poem is agriculture. Divided into four books, it is also the shortest of Virgil's main poetry, with only 2188 hexametric verses. The poem draws on a variety of prior sources and has influenced many later authors from antiquity to the present.  - Summary by Leni", "duration": 10303, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "6359", "name": " Virgil"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/georgics_2009_librivox/georgics_2009.jpg", "copyright_year": "1881", "genres": ["Classics (Greek & Latin Antiquity)", "Epics"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Leni"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Leni"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "cadastra"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Book 1, Part 1:The Invocation; Spring Ploughing; Treatment of the Land; Irrigation; The Beginnings of Agriculture", "readers": [10570], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/georgics_2009_librivox/georgics_01_virgil_64kb.mp3", "duration": 695}, {"section": 2, "title": "Book 1, Part 2: Tools and Tasks; Ancient Maxims; Star-Lore; Appropriate Times for Tasks", "readers": [14309], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/georgics_2009_librivox/georgics_02_virgil_64kb.mp3", "duration": 603}, {"section": 3, "title": "Book 1, Part 3: Storms; The Worship Of Ceres; Weather Signs; The Portents At Julius Caesar\u2019s Death; A Prayer for Augustus\u2019s Success", "readers": [14424], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/georgics_2009_librivox/georgics_03_virgil_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1119}, {"section": 4, "title": "Book 2, Part 1: Methods of Propagation; The Labour Required; Treatment Of Individual Species; The Effects of Climate and Location; A Celebration of Italy", "readers": [14395], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/georgics_2009_librivox/georgics_04_virgil_64kb.mp3", "duration": 848}, {"section": 5, "title": "Book 2, Part 2: The Nature of Various Soils; The Recognition of Soil Types; Planting A Vineyard", "readers": [10570], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/georgics_2009_librivox/georgics_05_virgil_64kb.mp3", "duration": 792}, {"section": 6, "title": "Book 2, Part 3: Care of The Vineyard; A Wealth of Trees And Plants; The Joys Of The True Life", "readers": [10570], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/georgics_2009_librivox/georgics_06_virgil_64kb.mp3", "duration": 883}, {"section": 7, "title": "Book 3, Part 1: Introduction; Breeding Stock", "readers": [14309], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/georgics_2009_librivox/georgics_07_virgil_64kb.mp3", "duration": 558}, {"section": 8, "title": "Book 3, Part 2: Care of the Sire and Dam; Care of Calves and Foals; The Dangers of Desire", "readers": [14309], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/georgics_2009_librivox/georgics_08_virgil_64kb.mp3", "duration": 700}, {"section": 9, "title": "Book 3, Part 3: The Care of Sheep and Goats; The Herdsmen of Africa and Scythia; Tending the Flocks", "readers": [14309], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/georgics_2009_librivox/georgics_09_virgil_64kb.mp3", "duration": 653}, {"section": 10, "title": "Book 3, Part 4: The Treatment of Diseases; The Plague", "readers": [14309], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/georgics_2009_librivox/georgics_10_virgil_64kb.mp3", "duration": 544}, {"section": 11, "title": "Book 4, Part 1: Introduction; Location and Maintenance of the Apiary; The Fighting Swarms; The Surrounding Garden", "readers": [8576], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/georgics_2009_librivox/georgics_11_virgil_64kb.mp3", "duration": 759}, {"section": 12, "title": "Book 4, Part 2: The Nature and Qualities of Bees; Gathering The Honey; Disease in Bees; Autogenesis of Bees", "readers": [8576], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/georgics_2009_librivox/georgics_12_virgil_64kb.mp3", "duration": 820}, {"section": 13, "title": "Book 4, Part 3: Aristaeus And His Mother Cyrene; The Capture of Proteus", "readers": [8576], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/georgics_2009_librivox/georgics_13_virgil_64kb.mp3", "duration": 711}, {"section": 14, "title": "Book 4, Part 4: Orpheus and Eurydice; Aristaeus Sacrifices to Orpheus; Virgil\u2019s Envoi", "readers": [8576], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/georgics_2009_librivox/georgics_14_virgil_64kb.mp3", "duration": 618}]}
