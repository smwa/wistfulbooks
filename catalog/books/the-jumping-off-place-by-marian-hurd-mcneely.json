{"title": "Jumping-Off Place", "description": "Set in 1910, \"The Jumping-Off Place\" is the story of four orphaned children who leave their home in Wisconsin to \"prove up\" their claim to a parcel of land in South Dakota.  \r\n<br><br>\r\nThe four Linville children -- Becky, age seventeen, and her younger siblings Dick, Phil and Joan -- had planned to take on this opportunity with the help and guidance of their Uncle Jim.  His untimely death means they must \"prove up\" the claim on their own.\r\n<br><br>\r\nUncle Jim had planned carefully, and had left detailed instructions for Becky and her brother Jim.  The children know it will be difficult -- but just how difficult they only discover when they arrive in South Dakota.  They will need to overcome the challenges of summer drought, winter blizzards, and claim-jumping squatters to \"prove up\" their claim.  They'll also need to make a place for themselves in their new community, and earn the trust and support of their neighbors.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\"The Jumping-Off Place\" has been recognized as a Newbery Honor book for the year 1930. - Summary by Tom Booker", "duration": 25654, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "19210", "name": "Marian Hurd McNeely"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/jumpingoffplace_2509_librivox/jumpingoffplace_2509.jpg", "copyright_year": "1929", "genres": ["Family Life", "Action & Adventure", "Family"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "tombooker"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "tombooker"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Ann Boulais"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Rapunzelina"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Chapter I:  Where the West Begins", "readers": [19399], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/jumpingoffplace_2509_librivox/jumpingoffplace_01_mcneely_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2259}, {"section": 2, "title": "Chapter II:  The Jumping-Off Place", "readers": [19399], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/jumpingoffplace_2509_librivox/jumpingoffplace_02_mcneely_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2515}, {"section": 3, "title": "Chapter III: Neighbors", "readers": [19399], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/jumpingoffplace_2509_librivox/jumpingoffplace_03_mcneely_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2020}, {"section": 4, "title": "Chapter IV:  Troubles", "readers": [19399], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/jumpingoffplace_2509_librivox/jumpingoffplace_04_mcneely_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2051}, {"section": 5, "title": "Chapter V:  Making a Home", "readers": [19399], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/jumpingoffplace_2509_librivox/jumpingoffplace_05_mcneely_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2122}, {"section": 6, "title": "Chapter VI: The Enemy Attacks", "readers": [19399], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/jumpingoffplace_2509_librivox/jumpingoffplace_06_mcneely_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2162}, {"section": 7, "title": "Chapter VII: A Message from Uncle Jim", "readers": [19399], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/jumpingoffplace_2509_librivox/jumpingoffplace_07_mcneely_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2332}, {"section": 8, "title": "Chapter VIII:  Prairie Bonds", "readers": [19399], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/jumpingoffplace_2509_librivox/jumpingoffplace_08_mcneely_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2316}, {"section": 9, "title": "Chapter IX:  School", "readers": [19399], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/jumpingoffplace_2509_librivox/jumpingoffplace_09_mcneely_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2558}, {"section": 10, "title": "Chapter X:  Snow Bound", "readers": [19399], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/jumpingoffplace_2509_librivox/jumpingoffplace_10_mcneely_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2759}, {"section": 11, "title": "Chapter XI:  The Call of the Prairie", "readers": [19399], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/jumpingoffplace_2509_librivox/jumpingoffplace_11_mcneely_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2560}]}
