{"title": "Observations Upon the Apocalypse of St. John", "description": "While Isaac Newton is most known today for his research in physics, during his own life he was also well-known for his religious scholarship. Engaging in intensive research on Christian history, theology, and the Bible, Newton cared deeply about understanding his faith. Among Newton's writings are those on prophecies described in the Bible. Here, he analyzes the last book of the New Testament - Revelation AKA the Apocalypse of St. John - in order to gain an understanding of the world's end times. He seems especially interested in tracking how post-Jesus Roman history compares with the events described in Revelation. Observations Upon the Apocalypse of St. John was posthumously published in 1733, as part of Newton's larger work on Bible prophecy.
