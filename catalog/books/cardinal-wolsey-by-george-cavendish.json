{"title": "Life and Death of Cardinal Wolsey", "description": "Thomas Wolsey was an English statesman and Catholic bishop. His appointment as a cardinal by Pope Leo X in 1515 gave him precedence over all other English clergy.<br><br>\r\n\r\nHenry VIII's passion for Anne Boleyn and his consequent rejection of his wife Catherine of Aragon resulted in Henry's push for a wedding annulment. As the king's chief adviser and Lord Chancellor, Cardinal Wolsey failed to negotiate an annulment of Henry's marriage to Catherine. He fell out of favour and was stripped of his government titles.<br><br>\r\n\r\nGeorge Cavendish was Cardinal Wolsey's \"Gentleman Usher\".<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe intrinsic value of Cavendish's Life of Cardinal Wolsey has long been perceived, for it is the sole authentic record of a multitude of events highly important in a particularly interesting section of the history of England. Cavendish has been recognized as the earliest of the great English biographers. He writes with simplicity and vividness, rarely yielding to the rhetoric which governed the ordinary prose of his age. Shakespeare is said to have used this work as the basis for his play \"Henry VIII\".<br><br>\r\n\r\nNote: Latin passages recorded by Kazbek.<br><br>\r\n\r\n(Summary by Wikipedia & John Greenman)", "duration": 29461, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "17199", "name": "George Cavendish"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/cardinalwolsey_2212_librivox/life_death_wolsley_2301.jpg", "copyright_year": "1905", "genres": ["Biography & Autobiography", "Middle Ages/Middle History"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "John Greenman"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "John Greenman"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Kazbek"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "InTheDesert"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Introductory Note and The Prologue", "readers": [107], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/cardinalwolsey_2212_librivox/cardinalwolsey_00_cavendish_64kb.mp3", "duration": 629}, {"section": 1, "title": "Part One-Earning the King's Trust", "readers": [107], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/cardinalwolsey_2212_librivox/cardinalwolsey_01_cavendish_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2176}, {"section": 2, "title": "Part Two - His Household", "readers": [107], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/cardinalwolsey_2212_librivox/cardinalwolsey_02_cavendish_64kb.mp3", "duration": 493}, {"section": 3, "title": "Part Three - Being an Ambassador, Attending to Westminster, Repairing to the court in Greenwich", "readers": [107], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/cardinalwolsey_2212_librivox/cardinalwolsey_03_cavendish_64kb.mp3", "duration": 600}, {"section": 4, "title": "Part Four - The King's Visit to the Cardinal", "readers": [107], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/cardinalwolsey_2212_librivox/cardinalwolsey_04_cavendish_64kb.mp3", "duration": 611}, {"section": 5, "title": "Part Five - Wolsey intervenes to stop Anne Boleyn and Lord Percy's plans", "readers": [107], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/cardinalwolsey_2212_librivox/cardinalwolsey_05_cavendish_64kb.mp3", "duration": 922}, {"section": 6, "title": "Part Six - Anne\u2019s Grudge against the Cardinal develops", "readers": [107], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/cardinalwolsey_2212_librivox/cardinalwolsey_06_cavendish_64kb.mp3", "duration": 377}, {"section": 7, "title": "Part Seven - The Cardinal moves the King to attack France", "readers": [107], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/cardinalwolsey_2212_librivox/cardinalwolsey_07_cavendish_64kb.mp3", "duration": 887}, {"section": 8, "title": "Part Eight \u2013 A plot against the Cardinal succeeds in having him lead an \u201cambassy\u201d to the Pope", "readers": [107], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/cardinalwolsey_2212_librivox/cardinalwolsey_08_cavendish_64kb.mp3", "duration": 936}, {"section": 9, "title": "Part Nine \u2013 Wolsey meets the French King but disagreements surface among courtiers", "readers": [107], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/cardinalwolsey_2212_librivox/cardinalwolsey_09_cavendish_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1522}, {"section": 10, "title": "Part Ten \u2013 The Cardinal writes to his King and attends a boar hunt with the French King", "readers": [107], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/cardinalwolsey_2212_librivox/cardinalwolsey_10_cavendish_64kb.mp3", "duration": 493}, {"section": 11, "title": "Part Eleven \u2013 The Cardinal suffers Divers Displeasures and leaves for England", "readers": [107], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/cardinalwolsey_2212_librivox/cardinalwolsey_11_cavendish_64kb.mp3", "duration": 352}, {"section": 12, "title": "Part Twelve \u2013 French noblemen, the Cardinal and the King proclaim perpetual peace and amity.
