{"title": "Jewish Children (Yudishe Kinder)", "description": "Although written from a child's perspective, this is not a kids book but a series of funny, poignant, and sometimes disturbing stories about life in a late 19th-century Russian-Jewish village -- the world of my grandparents. Sholem Rabinovich (1859-1916) was born in Pereiaslav, Ukraine and later immigrated to New York. His short stories about Tevye and his daughters were freely adapted into the musical FIDDLER ON THE ROOF. Rabinovich's will contained the following injunction: \"Let my name be recalled with laughter or not at all.\" His translator, Hannah Berman, was Irish of Lithuanian descent.</p>\n\nSome of these stories may be too intense for younger children.
