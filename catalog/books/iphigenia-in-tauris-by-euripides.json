{"title": "Iphigenia in Tauris", "description": "Orestes, coming into Tauri in Scythia, in company with Pylades, had been commanded to bear away the image of Diana, after which he was to meet with a respite from the avenging Erinnyes of his mother. His sister Iphigenia, who had been carried away by Diana from Aulis, when on the point of being sacrificed by her father, chances to be expiating a dream that led her to suppose Orestes dead, when a herdsman announces to her the arrival and detection of two strangers, whom she is bound by her office to sacrifice to Diana. On meeting, a mutual discovery takes place, and they plot their escape. - Summary by Theodore Buckley\n\n<b>Cast List:</b>Iphigenia: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/1259\">Elizabeth Klett</a><br>Orestes: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/10143\">Ashur Gharavi</a><br>Pylades: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/8164\">Rob Board</a><br>Herdsman: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/10140\">Jeffrey Church</a><br>Thoas: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/7170\">alanmapstone</a><br>Messenger: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/6281\">Beth Thomas</a><br>Minerva: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/8883\">Lydia</a><br>Chorus: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/6548\">Kristin Gjerl\u00f8w</a><br>Narrator: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/4174\">Availle</a><br><br>", "duration": 5423, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "1247", "name": " Euripides"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/iphigeniaintauris_1510_librivox/iphigenia_tauris_way_1510.jpg", "copyright_year": "1892", "genres": ["Classics (Greek & Latin Antiquity)", "Drama"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Elizabeth Klett"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "J.
