In this issue, \"The Moral Pirates\" face surprises during their first night of camping in the fourth part of their story, the life of American military leader William Eaton and his service in the First Barbary War between the United States and Tripoli is told, and rivals \"The Hare and The Badger\" wage a grisly war of comeuppance and revenge in a \"story from the Japanese\". Other highlights of this issue include a natural history of the \"royal tiger of Asia\"; a recollection of the dismal \"New York Prison-Ships\" that held American prisoners of war during the Revolution; and, a new serial story begins with chapter one of a young family's summer journey to the Catskills in \"Miss Van Winkle's Nap\".
