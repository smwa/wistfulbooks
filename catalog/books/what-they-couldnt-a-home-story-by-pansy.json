{"title": "What They Couldn't: A Home Story", "description": "The Cameron family tries to keep up in society despite their more limited finances, by \"making a dollar look to [their] friends as though it was ten dollars,\" much to the harried father's embarrassment and potential ruin. In addition to the financial stress, the youngest daughter has been \"bringing up herself,\" such that she's on the road to moral peril. This story follows the life of the family as they walk the tightrope between social acceptability and financial stability, moral failure and strength through the guidance of Jesus Christ. - Summary by TriciaG", "duration": 41147, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "157", "name": " Pansy"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/whattheycouldnt_2204_librivox/whattheycouldnt_2204.jpg", "copyright_year": "1895", "genres": ["Christian Fiction"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "TriciaG"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "TriciaG"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "TriciaG"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Joy M."}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Family Problems", "readers": [3157], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/whattheycouldnt_2204_librivox/whattheycouldnt_01_pansy_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1434}, {"section": 2, "title": "Trying to \"Belong\"", "readers": [3157], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/whattheycouldnt_2204_librivox/whattheycouldnt_02_pansy_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1384}, {"section": 3, "title": "Burns and Heart-Burns", "readers": [3157], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/whattheycouldnt_2204_librivox/whattheycouldnt_03_pansy_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1496}, {"section": 4, "title": "O Wad Some Power", "readers": [3157], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/whattheycouldnt_2204_librivox/whattheycouldnt_04_pansy_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1461}, {"section": 5, "title": "In the Gloom", "readers": [3157], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/whattheycouldnt_2204_librivox/whattheycouldnt_05_pansy_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1390}, {"section": 6, "title": "\"Isn't She a Terror!\"", "readers": [3157], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/whattheycouldnt_2204_librivox/whattheycouldnt_06_pansy_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1430}, {"section": 7, "title": "A \"Peculiar\" Man", "readers": [3157], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/whattheycouldnt_2204_librivox/whattheycouldnt_07_pansy_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1329}, {"section": 8, "title": "A Lesson in Fanaticism", "readers": [3157], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/whattheycouldnt_2204_librivox/whattheycouldnt_08_pansy_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1510}, {"section": 9, "title": "Home Thrusts", "readers": [3157], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/whattheycouldnt_2204_librivox/whattheycouldnt_09_pansy_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1480}, {"section": 10, "title": "\"How Will It All End?\"", "readers": [3157], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/whattheycouldnt_2204_librivox/whattheycouldnt_10_pansy_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1413}, {"section": 11, "title": "\"Out of His Sphere\"", "readers": [3157], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/whattheycouldnt_2204_librivox/whattheycouldnt_11_pansy_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1331}, {"section": 12, "title": "A New Departure", "readers": [3157], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/whattheycouldnt_2204_librivox/whattheycouldnt_12_pansy_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1288}, {"section": 13, "title": "\"A Good Fellow in Every Way\"", "readers": [3157], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/whattheycouldnt_2204_librivox/whattheycouldnt_13_pansy_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1447}, {"section": 14, "title": "A New Game", "readers": [3157], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/whattheycouldnt_2204_librivox/whattheycouldnt_14_pansy_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1375}, {"section": 15, "title": "\"Katherine Spelled with a K\"", "readers": [3157], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/whattheycouldnt_2204_librivox/whattheycouldnt_15_pansy_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1383}, {"section": 16, "title": "Being Weighed", "readers": [3157], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/whattheycouldnt_2204_librivox/whattheycouldnt_16_pansy_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1431}, {"section": 17, "title": "\"Just Once\"", "readers": [3157], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/whattheycouldnt_2204_librivox/whattheycouldnt_17_pansy_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1396}, {"section": 18, "title": "A Troublesome Promise", "readers": [3157], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/whattheycouldnt_2204_librivox/whattheycouldnt_18_pansy_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1131}, {"section": 19, "title": "A Startling Witness", "readers": [3157], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/whattheycouldnt_2204_librivox/whattheycouldnt_19_pansy_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1336}, {"section": 20, "title": "The Shadows of Coming Events", "readers": [3157], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/whattheycouldnt_2204_librivox/whattheycouldnt_20_pansy_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1373}, {"section": 21, "title": "\"Don't Ask Me Any Questions\"", "readers": [3157], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/whattheycouldnt_2204_librivox/whattheycouldnt_21_pansy_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1342}, {"section": 22, "title": "A Persistent Friend", "readers": [3157], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/whattheycouldnt_2204_librivox/whattheycouldnt_22_pansy_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1378}, {"section": 23, "title": "Borrowed (?)
