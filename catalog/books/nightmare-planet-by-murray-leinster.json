{"title": "Nightmare Planet", "description": "In science-fiction, as in all categories of fiction, there are stories that are so outstanding from the standpoint of characterization, concept, and background development that they remain popular for decades. Two such stories were Murray Leinster's The Mad Planet and Red Dust. Originally published in 1923, they have been reprinted frequently both here and abroad. They are now scheduled for book publication. Especially for this magazine, Murray Leinster has written the final story in the series. It is not necessary to have read the previous stories to enjoy this one. Once again, Burl experiences magnificent adventures against a colorful background, but to the whole the author has added philosophical and psychological observations that give this story a flavor seldom achieved in science-fiction. - Summary by Original magazine blurb from Science Fiction Plus, June 1953", "duration": 6478, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "479", "name": "Murray Leinster"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/nightmareplanet_1403_librivox/nightmare_planet_1403.jpg", "copyright_year": "1953", "genres": ["Science Fiction"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Zachary Brewster-Geisz"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Zachary Brewster-Geisz"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "J.
