When Marian was puzzled there came a little straight line, exactly in the middle, between her two eyebrows. \"What are bumpies?\" she said. \"My hat!\" he gasped. \"Haven't you ever heard of bumpies?\" Marian shook her head. \"Oh dear, oh dear!\" he sighed. \"Have you ever heard of angels?\" \"Well, of course,\" said Marian. \"Everybody's heard of angels.\" \"Well then, bumpies,\" said Mr Jugg, \"are baby angels. They're called bumpies till they've learned to fly.\" \"I see,\" said Marian, \"but why are they called bumpies?\" \"Because they bump,\" said Mr Jugg, \"not knowing how.\" (Summary by Phil Chenevert and from the first chapter)", "duration": 15898, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "3288", "name": "H.
