{"title": "Frost at Midnight", "description": "Samuel Taylor Coleridge was an English poet, literary critic, philosopher and theologian who, with his friend William Wordsworth, was a founder of the Romantic Movement in England and a member of the Lake Poets. He wrote the poems The Rime of the Ancient Mariner and Kubla Khan, as well as the major prose work Biographia Literaria. \n\nThroughout his adult life Coleridge had crippling bouts of anxiety and depression; it has been speculated that he had bipolar disorder, which had not been defined during his lifetime. He was physically unhealthy, which may have stemmed from a bout of rheumatic fever and other childhood illnesses. He was treated for these conditions with laudanum, which fostered a lifelong opium addiction. - Summary by Wikipedia", "duration": 2370, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "1691", "name": "Samuel Taylor Coleridge"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/frost_at_midnight_1801.poem_librivox/frost_midnight_1801.jpg", "copyright_year": "1912", "genres": ["Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Frost at Midnight - Read by AF", "readers": [11463], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/frost_at_midnight_1801.poem_librivox/frost_coleridge_af_64kb.mp3", "duration": 272}, {"section": 2, "title": "Frost at Midnight - Read by ALP", "readers": [4705], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/frost_at_midnight_1801.poem_librivox/frost_coleridge_alp_64kb.mp3", "duration": 293}, {"section": 3, "title": "Frost at Midnight - Read by DL", "readers": [2911], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/frost_at_midnight_1801.poem_librivox/frost_coleridge_dl_64kb.mp3", "duration": 297}, {"section": 4, "title": "Frost at Midnight - Read by EL", "readers": [9872], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/frost_at_midnight_1801.poem_librivox/frost_coleridge_el_64kb.mp3", "duration": 340}, {"section": 5, "title": "Frost at Midnight - Read by LCW", "readers": [8425], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/frost_at_midnight_1801.poem_librivox/frost_coleridge_lcw_64kb.mp3", "duration": 262}, {"section": 6, "title": "Frost at Midnight - Read by NR", "readers": [11535], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/frost_at_midnight_1801.poem_librivox/frost_coleridge_nr_64kb.mp3", "duration": 301}, {"section": 7, "title": "Frost at Midnight - Read by TP", "readers": [10789], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/frost_at_midnight_1801.poem_librivox/frost_coleridge_tp_64kb.mp3", "duration": 307}, {"section": 8, "title": "Frost at Midnight - Read by VBV", "readers": [11362], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/frost_at_midnight_1801.poem_librivox/frost_coleridge_vbv_64kb.mp3", "duration": 298}]}
