{"title": "Repairman", "description": "This is a collection of 3 of Harry Harrison marvelous early stories that were published in Galaxy, Analog and Fantastic Universe. The Repairman (1958) is a straight fun SF story of a man getting a job done. It is most typical of his later style in series like the Stainless Steel Rat; Toy Shop (1962), a short piece exploring bureaucratic blindness and one ingenious way around it and The Velvet Glove (1956), my favorite for its writing style, fun perspective, sly social commentary on the scene in 1956 and just plain delightful imagination. And he manages to pack excitement and mystery in at the same time.</p>   ", "duration": 5639, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "399", "name": "Harry Harrison"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt28/repairman_1301.jpg", "copyright_year": "1951", "genres": ["Science Fiction", "Short Stories"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "DaveC"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "1 - The Repairman, Part 1", "readers": [5717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/therepairman_pc_librivox/therepairman_1_harrison_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1153}, {"section": 2, "title": "2 - The Repairman, Part 2", "readers": [5717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/therepairman_pc_librivox/therepairman_2_harrison_64kb.mp3", "duration": 941}, {"section": 3, "title": "3 - Toy Shop", "readers": [5717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/therepairman_pc_librivox/therepairman_3_harrison_64kb.mp3", "duration": 696}, {"section": 4, "title": "4 - The Velvet Glove", "readers": [5717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/therepairman_pc_librivox/therepairman_4_harrison_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2849}]}
