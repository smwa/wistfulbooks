{"title": "Dream of John Ball", "description": "A Dream of John Ball recounts a dream of being transported back in time to 1381 during the Peasants' Revolt as John Ball and an army of peasants prepare to march on London. Morris gives us a beautiful depiction of England during a period of the Middle Ages where common people began to realize their worth and imagine a better future than being chattel of the ruling class. The main character finds himself at a spirited rally of peasants featuring a speech from John Ball himself, followed by a battle for their township where the English longbow and clothyard shaft win the day. The story concludes with an intimate discussion between the main character and John Ball that contrasts the social hierarchies of medieval England and William Morris's own Victorian era, which feels remarkably close to the present. A Dream of John Ball is Morris illuminating the virtues of the Middle Ages to aspire to a better future for ourselves. - Summary by Taylor Whitehead", "duration": 8625, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "961", "name": "William Morris"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/dreamofjohnball_2403_librivox/ADreamOfJohnBall_2403.jpg", "copyright_year": "1888", "genres": ["Historical Fiction", "Fantasy Fiction"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Lauren Huff"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Lauren Huff"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Amy Gramour"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Laura Victoria"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Chapters 1-5", "readers": [12532], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/dreamofjohnball_2403_librivox/dreamofjohnball_01_morris_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3491}, {"section": 2, "title": "Chapters 6-9", "readers": [12532], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/dreamofjohnball_2403_librivox/dreamofjohnball_02_morris_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2674}, {"section": 3, "title": "Chapters 9-12", "readers": [12532], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/dreamofjohnball_2403_librivox/dreamofjohnball_03_morris_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2460}]}
