{"title": "Short Stories Of William Henry Harrison Murray", "description": "Murray (1840-1904) was a sometime clergyman, journalist, and purveyor of the outdoor life.  His books did much to popularize the virtues of outdoor experience, especially in the Adirondack Mountains of upstate New York.  Here are stories, some humorous some serious, of the out-of-doors, of love between man and woman, man and horse, man and dog, teacher and acolyte, of wisdom and foolishness.   This recording is a selection of his short stories from \"The Busted Ex-Texan And Other Stories\" (1889), \"How Deacon Tubman And Parson Whitney Kept New Years And Other Stories\" (1888) and \"A Ride With A Mad Horse In A Freight-Car\" (1898). - Summary by david wales", "duration": 18545, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "14017", "name": "William Henry Harrison Murray"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/short_stories_of_william_henry_harrison_murray_1903_librivox/williamhenryharrisonmurrayshortstories_1903.jpg", "copyright_year": "1889", "genres": ["Nature & Animal Fiction", "Westerns", "Anthologies"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "David Wales"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "David Wales"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "DaveC"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "DaveC"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "The Busted Ex-Texan", "readers": [6454], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/short_stories_of_william_henry_harrison_murray_1903_librivox/williamhenryharrisonmurrayshortstories_01_murray_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3297}, {"section": 2, "title": "The Leaf Of Gold", "readers": [6454], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/short_stories_of_william_henry_harrison_murray_1903_librivox/williamhenryharrisonmurrayshortstories_02_murray_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1203}, {"section": 3, "title": "How Deacon Tubman And Parson Whitney Kept New Years", "readers": [6454], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/short_stories_of_william_henry_harrison_murray_1903_librivox/williamhenryharrisonmurrayshortstories_03_murray_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2630}, {"section": 4, "title": "The Old Beggar's Dog", "readers": [6454], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/short_stories_of_william_henry_harrison_murray_1903_librivox/williamhenryharrisonmurrayshortstories_04_murray_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2287}, {"section": 5, "title": "The Ball", "readers": [6454], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/short_stories_of_william_henry_harrison_murray_1903_librivox/williamhenryharrisonmurrayshortstories_05_murray_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1811}, {"section": 6, "title": "Who He Was Part 1", "readers": [6454], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/short_stories_of_william_henry_harrison_murray_1903_librivox/williamhenryharrisonmurrayshortstories_06_murray_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2277}, {"section": 7, "title": "Who He Was Part 2", "readers": [6454], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/short_stories_of_william_henry_harrison_murray_1903_librivox/williamhenryharrisonmurrayshortstories_07_murray_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2602}, {"section": 8, "title": "A Ride With A Mad Horse In A Freight-Car", "readers": [6454], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/short_stories_of_william_henry_harrison_murray_1903_librivox/williamhenryharrisonmurrayshortstories_08_murray_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2438}]}
