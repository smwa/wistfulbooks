It seemed as if the very freckles were trying to hide from it.  Tommy didn\u2019t care. He said so. He said so right out loud. He didn\u2019t care if all the world knew it. He wanted the world to know it. It was a horrid old world anyway\u2026\u201d\nSoon, Tommy finds the \u201cwishing stone.\u201d  His wishes transform him into a mouse, and then a succession of animals of the forest giving him a new perspective and exciting adventures, including times with Peter Rabbit and other forest friends.
