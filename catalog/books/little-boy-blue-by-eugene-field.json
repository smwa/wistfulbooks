{"title": "Little Boy Blue", "description": "LibriVox volunteers bring you 15 recordings of Little Boy Blue by Eugene Field.<br>\r\nThis was the Weekly Poetry project for November 23, 2025.   <br> ------<br>\r\nField first started publishing poetry in 1879, with his poem \"Christmas Treasures\" that later appeared in his collection A Little Book of Western Verse.  Over a dozen volumes of poetry followed, starting in 1889,[8] and he became well known for his light-hearted poems for children, among the most famous of which are \"Wynken, Blynken, and Nod\" and \"The Duel\" (which is perhaps better known as \"The Gingham Dog and the Calico Cat\"). Equally famous is his poem about the death of a child, this week's poem,  \"Little Boy Blue\".\r\n\r\n - Summary by Wikipedia", "duration": 1384, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "614", "name": "Eugene Field"}], "coverArt": null, "copyright_year": "1894", "genres": ["Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "David Lawrence"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Little Boy Blue - read by BK", "readers": [8786], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/littleboyblue_2511.poem_librivox/littleboyblue_field_bk_64kb.mp3", "duration": 104}, {"section": 2, "title": "Little Boy Blue - read by BWC", "readers": [17576], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/littleboyblue_2511.poem_librivox/littleboyblue_field_bwc_64kb.mp3", "duration": 84}, {"section": 3, "title": "Little Boy Blue - read by DL", "readers": [2911], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/littleboyblue_2511.poem_librivox/littleboyblue_field_dl_64kb.mp3", "duration": 103}, {"section": 4, "title": "Little Boy Blue - read by DLS", "readers": [15365], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/littleboyblue_2511.poem_librivox/littleboyblue_field_dls_64kb.mp3", "duration": 97}, {"section": 5, "title": "Little Boy Blue - read by GLN", "readers": [4969], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/littleboyblue_2511.poem_librivox/littleboyblue_field_gln_64kb.mp3", "duration": 105}, {"section": 6, "title": "Little Boy Blue - read by JMJ", "readers": [20412], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/littleboyblue_2511.poem_librivox/littleboyblue_field_jmj_64kb.mp3", "duration": 98}, {"section": 7, "title": "Little Boy Blue - read by LAH", "readers": [1212], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/littleboyblue_2511.poem_librivox/littleboyblue_field_lah_64kb.mp3", "duration": 85}, {"section": 8, "title": "Little Boy Blue - read by LCW", "readers": [8425], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/littleboyblue_2511.poem_librivox/littleboyblue_field_lcw_64kb.mp3", "duration": 91}, {"section": 9, "title": "Little Boy Blue - read by PFS", "readers": [8576], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/littleboyblue_2511.poem_librivox/littleboyblue_field_pfs_64kb.mp3", "duration": 89}, {"section": 10, "title": "Little Boy Blue - read by PG", "readers": [19942], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/littleboyblue_2511.poem_librivox/littleboyblue_field_pg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 88}, {"section": 11, "title": "Little Boy Blue - read by SLM", "readers": [17334], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/littleboyblue_2511.poem_librivox/littleboyblue_field_slm_64kb.mp3", "duration": 80}, {"section": 12, "title": "Little Boy Blue - read by SP", "readers": [19584], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/littleboyblue_2511.poem_librivox/littleboyblue_field_sp_64kb.mp3", "duration": 87}, {"section": 13, "title": "Little Boy Blue - read by VLS", "readers": [20245], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/littleboyblue_2511.poem_librivox/littleboyblue_field_vls_64kb.mp3", "duration": 88}, {"section": 14, "title": "Little Boy Blue - read by VOD", "readers": [8338], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/littleboyblue_2511.poem_librivox/littleboyblue_field_vod_64kb.mp3", "duration": 89}, {"section": 15, "title": "Little Boy Blue - read by WJA", "readers": [17246], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/littleboyblue_2511.poem_librivox/littleboyblue_field_wja_64kb.mp3", "duration": 96}]}
