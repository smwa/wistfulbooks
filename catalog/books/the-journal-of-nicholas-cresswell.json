{"title": "Journal of Nicholas Cresswell, 1774-1777", "description": "Against his family's wishes, the son of an English landowner emigrates to America in 1774 for reasons he won't reveal. His adventures take him\r\nfrom Barbados to trade cotton, to the Ohio frontier in search of farmland, and back to the ruins of New York during the Revolutionary War. Refusing to fight for the American side, fearing death in prison, and with his money running out, he struggles to find a way back to England.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAmazing adventures and fascinating observations of life, politics, piracy, survival in Indian country, and parties at George Washington's house during this critical period in America's history.
