{"title": "Erie Waters", "description": "\"Her death is not only a great loss to those who knew and loved her: it is a great loss to Canadian literature and to the Canadian nation. I must think that she will hold a memorable place among poets in virtue of her descent and also in virtue of the work she has left behind, small as the quantity of that work is. I believe that Canada will, in future times, cherish her memory more and more, for of all Canadian poets she was the most distinctly a daughter of the soil, inasmuch as she inherited the blood of the great primeval race now so rapidly vanishing, and of the greater race that has supplanted it.\" (Theodore Watts-Dunton, from the Introduction to Flint and Feather)", "duration": 794, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "1763", "name": "E.
