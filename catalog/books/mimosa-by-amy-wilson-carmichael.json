{"title": "Mimosa, Who Was Charmed", "description": "\u201cThis story is true.  It tells the eternally new tale of the matchless charm of our Lord Jesus Christ.  One look at that loveliness, and, though the one who looked did not even remember His name, she was his forever.  It [speaks] in a clear glad voice and it [says] \u2018Fear not at all.  Where your hands cannot reach and your love cannot help, His hands can reach and His love can help.  So why are you afraid?\u2019 And it is said that miles of space and solid walls and locked doors are nothing to Love.  Nothing at all.  And it is said\u2014and we set it down with a great hope that it may cheer some other, for it said it very earnestly, \u2018The seed is not your poor little word.  The seed is the Word of God.\u2019\u201d (from the Foreword)", "duration": 11526, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "11229", "name": "Amy Wilson Carmichael"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/mimosa_2401_librivox/mimosa_2401.jpg", "copyright_year": "1925", "genres": ["Biography & Autobiography", "Christianity - Biographies"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "MaryAnn"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "MaryAnn"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "MaryAnn"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Areduto"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Forward; Ch 1 - Mimosa; Ch 2 - Let the Stick Dance", "readers": [3645], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/mimosa_2401_librivox/mimosa_01_carmichael_64kb.mp3", "duration": 710}, {"section": 2, "title": "Ch 3 - I Could Be Crucified Once; Ch 4 - I Go to the Supreme", "readers": [3645], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/mimosa_2401_librivox/mimosa_02_carmichael_64kb.mp3", "duration": 528}, {"section": 3, "title": "Ch 5 - Parpom; Ch 6 - I Am Not Offended With You; Ch 7 - The Tulasi Plant", "readers": [3645], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/mimosa_2401_librivox/mimosa_03_carmichael_64kb.mp3", "duration": 966}, {"section": 4, "title": "Ch 8 - Mayil, Little Peacock; Ch 9 - Boaz", "readers": [3645], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/mimosa_2401_librivox/mimosa_04_carmichael_64kb.mp3", "duration": 622}, {"section": 5, "title": "Ch 10 - Did She Not Burn the Tulasi?; Ch 11 - Seed Corn; Ch 12 - Backgrounds", "readers": [3645], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/mimosa_2401_librivox/mimosa_05_carmichael_64kb.mp3", "duration": 800}, {"section": 6, "title": "Ch 13 - The Golden Pot That Had Manna; Ch 14 - The Stab of a Knife; Ch 15 - Take Care of My Bird", "readers": [3645], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/mimosa_2401_librivox/mimosa_06_carmichael_64kb.mp3", "duration": 819}, {"section": 7, "title": "Ch 16 - Hair Cutting; Ch 17 - The Magic Medicine; Ch 18 - The Talisman", "readers": [3645], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/mimosa_2401_librivox/mimosa_07_carmichael_64kb.mp3", "duration": 580}, {"section": 8, "title": "Ch 19 - In the House of Her Friends; Ch 20 - The Fortunate Fourth; Ch 21 - Mylo the Bull that Went to Heaven", "readers": [3645], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/mimosa_2401_librivox/mimosa_08_carmichael_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1010}, {"section": 9, "title": "Ch 22 - Siva's Sign; Ch 23 - The Unlucky Fifth; Ch 24 - The Ceremony of the Corner", "readers": [3645], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/mimosa_2401_librivox/mimosa_09_carmichael_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1214}, {"section": 10, "title": "Ch 25 - The Empt Oil Bottle; Ch 26 - Redeemer, Christ, Command Thy Double Healing; Ch 27 - The Fears of Love", "readers": [3645], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/mimosa_2401_librivox/mimosa_10_carmichael_64kb.mp3", "duration": 848}, {"section": 11, "title": "Ch 28 - Shal I Be Offended With You?; Ch 29 - I Know Him by Suffering; Ch 30 - The Five Rupee Notes", "readers": [3645], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/mimosa_2401_librivox/mimosa_11_carmichael_64kb.mp3", "duration": 897}, {"section": 12, "title": "Ch 31 - Star's Burden; Ch 32 - Blockhead; Ch 33 - As a Red hot Wire in the Ear", "readers": [3645], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/mimosa_2401_librivox/mimosa_12_carmichael_64kb.mp3", "duration": 765}, {"section": 13, "title": "Ch 34 - Bind on Thy Sandles; Ch 35 - Not in Dispair; Ch 36 - Mimosa?", "readers": [3645], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/mimosa_2401_librivox/mimosa_13_carmichael_64kb.mp3", "duration": 815}, {"section": 14, "title": "Ch 37 - The End of a Golden Thread; Ch 38 - Farewell, Little Brothers; Ch 39 - Send for Me: I Can Come", "readers": [3645], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/mimosa_2401_librivox/mimosa_14_carmichael_64kb.mp3", "duration": 688}, {"section": 15, "title": "Ch 40 - Love Will Find a Way", "readers": [3645], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/mimosa_2401_librivox/mimosa_15_carmichael_64kb.mp3", "duration": 264}]}
