{"title": "Peaks of Shala", "description": "This book was published in 1923. From the author's own Introduction: \"I would not have this book considered too seriously. It is not an attempt to untangle one thread in the Balkan snarl; it is not a study of primitive peoples; it is not a contribution to the world\u2019s knowledge, and I hope no one will read it to improve the mind. It should be read as the adventures in it were lived, with a gayly inquiring mind, a taste for strange peoples and unknown trails, and a delight in the unexpected. Here I give you only what I saw, felt, and most casually learned while adventuring among the tribes in the interior northern Albanian mountains...\"\r\n<br><br>\r\nThree brave American Zonyas (women) venture into the mountains of Northern Albania at a time not long after the Great War, when the boundaries (and even the right to exist) of the Balkan states were still hotly disputed. The author tells us why: \"the people are living as they lived twenty centuries ago, before the Greek or the Roman or the Slav was ever known. There are prehistoric cities up there, old legends, songs, customs that no one knows anything about. No stranger\u2019s ever even seen them.\"\r\n<br><br>\r\nWhat better reason to risk life, health, and limb?\r\n<br><br>\r\n(Summary by Steven Seitel)", "duration": 33679, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "912", "name": "Rose Wilder Lane"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/peaks_shala_ss_2203_librivox/peaksofshala_2203.jpg", "copyright_year": "1923", "genres": ["Travel & Geography", "Exploration"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Steven Seitel"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Steven Seitel"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Ann Boulais"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Michele Fry"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Introduction and Chapter 1", "readers": [4856], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/peaks_shala_ss_2203_librivox/peaksofshala_01_lane_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1444}, {"section": 2, "title": "Chapter 2", "readers": [4856], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/peaks_shala_ss_2203_librivox/peaksofshala_02_lane_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1829}, {"section": 3, "title": "Chapter 3", "readers": [4856], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/peaks_shala_ss_2203_librivox/peaksofshala_03_lane_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2056}, {"section": 4, "title": "Chapter 4", "readers": [4856], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/peaks_shala_ss_2203_librivox/peaksofshala_04_lane_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1100}, {"section": 5, "title": "Chapter 5", "readers": [4856], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/peaks_shala_ss_2203_librivox/peaksofshala_05_lane_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2062}, {"section": 6, "title": "Chapter 6", "readers": [4856], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/peaks_shala_ss_2203_librivox/peaksofshala_06_lane_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2325}, {"section": 7, "title": "Chapter 7", "readers": [4856], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/peaks_shala_ss_2203_librivox/peaksofshala_07_lane_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1928}, {"section": 8, "title": "Chapter 8", "readers": [4856], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/peaks_shala_ss_2203_librivox/peaksofshala_08_lane_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2321}, {"section": 9, "title": "Chapter 9", "readers": [4856], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/peaks_shala_ss_2203_librivox/peaksofshala_09_lane_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1415}, {"section": 10, "title": "Chapter 10", "readers": [4856], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/peaks_shala_ss_2203_librivox/peaksofshala_10_lane_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3176}, {"section": 11, "title": "Chapter 11", "readers": [4856], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/peaks_shala_ss_2203_librivox/peaksofshala_11_lane_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1562}, {"section": 12, "title": "Chapter 12", "readers": [4856], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/peaks_shala_ss_2203_librivox/peaksofshala_12_lane_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2223}, {"section": 13, "title": "Chapter 13", "readers": [4856], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/peaks_shala_ss_2203_librivox/peaksofshala_13_lane_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1545}, {"section": 14, "title": "Chapter 14", "readers": [4856], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/peaks_shala_ss_2203_librivox/peaksofshala_14_lane_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2200}, {"section": 15, "title": "Postscript, Part 1", "readers": [4856], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/peaks_shala_ss_2203_librivox/peaksofshala_15_lane_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3123}, {"section": 16, "title": "Postscript, Part 2", "readers": [4856], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/peaks_shala_ss_2203_librivox/peaksofshala_16_lane_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3370}]}
