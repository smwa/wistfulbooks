{"title": "What is Darwinism?", "description": "This is a question which needs an answer. Great confusion and diversity of opinion prevail as to the real views of the man whose writings have agitated the whole world, scientific and religious. If a man says he is a Darwinian, many understand him to avow himself virtually an atheist; while another understands him as saying that he adopts some harmless form of the doctrine of evolution. This is a great evil.<br><br>\r\n\r\nIt is obviously useless to discuss any theory until we are agreed as to what that theory is. The question, therefore, What is Darwinism? must take precedence of all discussion of its merits. - Summary from first chapter", "duration": 12581, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "16483", "name": "Charles Hodge"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/what_is_darwinism_2206_librivox/whatisdarwinism_2206.jpg", "copyright_year": "1874", "genres": ["Science", "Christianity - Other"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "InTheDesert"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "InTheDesert"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "DaveC"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "DaveC"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "What is Darwinism? - The Scriptural Solution of the Problem of the Universe", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/what_is_darwinism_2206_librivox/darwinism_01_hodge_64kb.mp3", "duration": 396}, {"section": 2, "title": "The Pantheistic Theory - Epicurean Theory - Herbert Spencer's New Philosophy", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/what_is_darwinism_2206_librivox/darwinism_02_hodge_64kb.mp3", "duration": 998}, {"section": 3, "title": "Hylozoic Theory - Theism in Unscriptural Forms", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/what_is_darwinism_2206_librivox/darwinism_03_hodge_64kb.mp3", "duration": 370}, {"section": 4, "title": "Mr. Darwin's Theory - Natural Selection", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/what_is_darwinism_2206_librivox/darwinism_04_hodge_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1049}, {"section": 5, "title": "The Sense in which Mr. Darwin uses the Word \"Natural.\"", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/what_is_darwinism_2206_librivox/darwinism_05_hodge_64kb.mp3", "duration": 860}, {"section": 6, "title": "Darwinism excludes Teleology - Darwin's own Testimony", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/what_is_darwinism_2206_librivox/darwinism_06_hodge_64kb.mp3", "duration": 879}, {"section": 7, "title": "Testimony of the Advocates of the Theory", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/what_is_darwinism_2206_librivox/darwinism_07_hodge_64kb.mp3", "duration": 567}, {"section": 8, "title": "Professor Huxley", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/what_is_darwinism_2206_librivox/darwinism_08_hodge_64kb.mp3", "duration": 659}, {"section": 9, "title": "B\u00fcchner", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/what_is_darwinism_2206_librivox/darwinism_09_hodge_64kb.mp3", "duration": 100}, {"section": 10, "title": "Carl Vogt", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/what_is_darwinism_2206_librivox/darwinism_10_hodge_64kb.mp3", "duration": 169}, {"section": 11, "title": "Haeckel", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/what_is_darwinism_2206_librivox/darwinism_11_hodge_64kb.mp3", "duration": 620}, {"section": 12, "title": "The Opponents of Darwinism - The Duke of Argyll", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/what_is_darwinism_2206_librivox/darwinism_12_hodge_64kb.mp3", "duration": 429}, {"section": 13, "title": "Agassiz - Janet", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/what_is_darwinism_2206_librivox/darwinism_13_hodge_64kb.mp3", "duration": 508}, {"section": 14, "title": "M.
