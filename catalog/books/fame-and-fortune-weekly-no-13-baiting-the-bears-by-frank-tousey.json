{"title": "Fame and Fortune Weekly No. 13: Baiting the Bears", "description": "Phil Thorne can really bounce back! The story starts with him unceremoniously losing his job (due to his own indiscretion), but immediately helping himself to a great spot by remaining compassionate for an elderly man who needs his help - that man becoming his next employer. Though some nasty men within his new office try to do him up, he overcomes their attempts with his honesty and determination for the truth. Phil teaches us about courage against men as well as calculated bravery in the stock market.
