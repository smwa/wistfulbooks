{"title": "History of the Thirty Years War, Volume 2", "description": "<i>The History of the Thirty Years War</i> is a five volume work, which followed his very successful <i>History of the Revolt of the Netherlands</i>. Written for a wider audience than Revolt, it is a vivid history, colored by Schiller\u2019s own interest in the question of human freedom and his rationalist optimism. Volume 2 covers late 1620 through the aftermath of the Battle of Leipzig (now known as the First Battle of Breitenfeld), in 1631.
