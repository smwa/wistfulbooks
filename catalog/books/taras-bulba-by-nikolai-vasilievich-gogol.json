{"title": "Taras Bulba; a Tale of the Cossacks", "description": "Taras Bulba is a romanticised historical novella by Nikolai Gogol set in Russia\u2019s equivalent of America\u2019s wild frontier, what is today Ukraine, a name which means something like \u201cfrontier\u201d or \u201cmarches\u201d. It was an ill-defined wild border land whose borders were subject to change and whose nominal rulers had allowed it to become a nuisance to them that it might also be a nuisance to the armies of their enemies and an obstacle to their advances. It was a time when men were men and sheep were scared and those men were Cossacks.<br>\n\nThe story concerns the lives and deaths of Cossack colonel Taras Bulba and his two sons Ostap and Andriy who have just graduated from the Kiev Academy. It is a tale of bravado, derring-do, defence of the faith, chivalry, romance, honour and above all carousing.
