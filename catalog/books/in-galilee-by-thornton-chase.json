{"title": "In Galilee", "description": "Thornton Chase is commonly recognized as the first convert to the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith of Occidental background. During his life he organized many Bah\u00e1'\u00ed activities in Chicago and Los Angeles and was considered a prominent Bah\u00e1'\u00ed. In 1907 Chase was able to go on pilgrimage. Though Chase was able to be with `Abdu'l Bah\u00e1 in Akka for only three days, the experience transformed him. `Abdu'l Bah\u00e1, highly impressed by Chase's qualities, conferred on him the title <i>Th\u00e1bit</i>, \"steadfast.\" On returning home Chase wrote an account of his pilgrimage, which was published under the title <i>In Galilee</i>] in 1908. The short work gives a detailed and poignant description of `Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1's home and family in Akka, as well as a moving description of `Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1 Himself. The work remains one of the most important examples of the genre commonly known as pilgrim's notes. \n(Summary by Wikipedia)", "duration": 7494, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "256", "name": "Thornton Chase"}], "coverArt": "https://www.archive.org/download/librivox_cd_covers/in_galilee_chase.jpg", "copyright_year": "1908", "genres": ["Memoirs", "Other religions"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Nicholas James Bridgewater"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Nicholas James Bridgewater"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Leni"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "mim@can (1949-2017)"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "01 - Quotes; Arrival; Haifa", "readers": [1618], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/in_galilee_nb_librivox/ingalilee_01_chase_64kb.mp3", "duration": 627}, {"section": 2, "title": "02 - The Holy Land; Mount Carmel; The Tomb of the Bab", "readers": [1618], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/in_galilee_nb_librivox/ingalilee_02_chase_64kb.mp3", "duration": 810}, {"section": 3, "title": "03 - The Way of the Sea", "readers": [1618], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/in_galilee_nb_librivox/ingalilee_03_chase_64kb.mp3", "duration": 888}, {"section": 4, "title": "04 - The Welcome, Abdul-Baha, the Mid-Day Meal", "readers": [1618], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/in_galilee_nb_librivox/ingalilee_04_chase_64kb.mp3", "duration": 975}, {"section": 5, "title": "05 - Universal Love, Dawn in Acca, the Sabbath Visit", "readers": [1618], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/in_galilee_nb_librivox/ingalilee_05_chase_64kb.mp3", "duration": 869}, {"section": 6, "title": "06 - Lessons of Humility, Incidents, A Heavenly Atmosphere", "readers": [1618], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/in_galilee_nb_librivox/ingalilee_06_chase_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1207}, {"section": 7, "title": "07 - The Servant of God; the Law of Love; Unity, Love and Service", "readers": [1618], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/in_galilee_nb_librivox/ingalilee_07_chase_64kb.mp3", "duration": 946}, {"section": 8, "title": "08 - The Feast of Fellowship; The World's Maturity", "readers": [1618], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/in_galilee_nb_librivox/ingalilee_08_chase_64kb.mp3", "duration": 611}, {"section": 9, "title": "09 - The Parting; The Tomb and the Rizwan", "readers": [1618], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/in_galilee_nb_librivox/ingalilee_09_chase_64kb.mp3", "duration": 561}]}
