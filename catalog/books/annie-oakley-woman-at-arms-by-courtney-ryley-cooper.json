{"title": "Annie Oakley, Woman at Arms", "description": "Annie Oakley was without a doubt the greatest markswomen who ever lived. She was christened Phoebe Ann Mosey but was called Annie from childhood. Oakley was the stage name that she assumed when she first started to perform with Frank Butler. From obscure and impoverished beginnings,  she made herself into the best known woman of her time, propelled by an indomitable spirit and an uncanny shooting ability. We learn of her enduring marriage to Frank Butler and their first meeting \u2014 a shooting match in which the seemingly delicate young girl defeated the professional marksman; her association with Buffalo Bill Cody\u2019s Wild West Show and its triumphal tour through Europe and America; the train crash that nearly took her life and her years as an actress and teacher. Yet with all her many successes she preserved her warmth, dedication and integrity. Her story remains to this day one of the grandest to have come out of the Old  West. - Summary from the jacket cover", "duration": 20693, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "10851", "name": "Courtney Ryley Cooper"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/annieoakleywomanatarms_2507_librivox/annie_oakley_2507.jpg", "copyright_year": "1927", "genres": ["Biography & Autobiography", "History"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Barry Eads"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Barry Eads"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Barry Eads"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Laura Victoria"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Chapter 1", "readers": [3664], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/annieoakleywomanatarms_2507_librivox/annieoakley_01_cooper_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1299}, {"section": 2, "title": "Chapter 2", "readers": [3664], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/annieoakleywomanatarms_2507_librivox/annieoakley_02_cooper_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1701}, {"section": 3, "title": "Chapter 3", "readers": [3664], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/annieoakleywomanatarms_2507_librivox/annieoakley_03_cooper_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1234}, {"section": 4, "title": "Chapter 4", "readers": [3664], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/annieoakleywomanatarms_2507_librivox/annieoakley_04_cooper_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1615}, {"section": 5, "title": "Chapter 5", "readers": [3664], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/annieoakleywomanatarms_2507_librivox/annieoakley_05_cooper_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1561}, {"section": 6, "title": "Chapter 6", "readers": [3664], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/annieoakleywomanatarms_2507_librivox/annieoakley_06_cooper_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1690}, {"section": 7, "title": "Chapter 7", "readers": [3664], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/annieoakleywomanatarms_2507_librivox/annieoakley_07_cooper_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1423}, {"section": 8, "title": "Chapter 8", "readers": [3664], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/annieoakleywomanatarms_2507_librivox/annieoakley_08_cooper_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1400}, {"section": 9, "title": "Chapter 9", "readers": [3664], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/annieoakleywomanatarms_2507_librivox/annieoakley_09_cooper_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1314}, {"section": 10, "title": "Chapter 10", "readers": [3664], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/annieoakleywomanatarms_2507_librivox/annieoakley_10_cooper_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1133}, {"section": 11, "title": "Chapter 11", "readers": [3664], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/annieoakleywomanatarms_2507_librivox/annieoakley_11_cooper_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1669}, {"section": 12, "title": "Chapter 12", "readers": [3664], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/annieoakleywomanatarms_2507_librivox/annieoakley_12_cooper_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1329}, {"section": 13, "title": "Chapter 13", "readers": [3664], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/annieoakleywomanatarms_2507_librivox/annieoakley_13_cooper_64kb.mp3", "duration": 877}, {"section": 14, "title": "Chapter 14", "readers": [3664], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/annieoakleywomanatarms_2507_librivox/annieoakley_14_cooper_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1037}, {"section": 15, "title": "Chapter 15", "readers": [3664], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/annieoakleywomanatarms_2507_librivox/annieoakley_15_cooper_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1411}]}
