{"title": "Tramp and Fish", "description": "James McIntyre, called The Cheese Poet, was a Canadian poet.<br /><br />\n\nMcIntyre was born in Forres, Scotland and came to Canada in 1841 at the age of 14, finally moving to Ingersoll, Ontario, then a town of 5,000 on the banks of the Thames in Oxford County, the heart of Canadian dairy country at the time. He opened a furniture factory on the river as well as a store which sold furniture, along with such items as pianos and coffins.<br /><br />\n\nHe was well loved in the community, from which he often received aid in hard times, due in part to his poesy and oratorical skills\u2014he was called on to speak at every kind of social gathering in Ingersoll. The region seems to have inspired him, and it was in celebration of the proud history of Canada, the natural beauty and industry of the region, and especially (as noted above) its cheese, that the majority of his oeuvre was written. - Summary by Wikipedia", "duration": 531, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "2285", "name": "James McIntyre"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt24/Tramp_Fish_1508.jpg", "copyright_year": "0", "genres": ["Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Tramp and Fish - Read by DL", "readers": [2911], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/tramp_and_fish_1508.poem_librivox/trampandfish_mcintyre_dl_64kb.mp3", "duration": 85}, {"section": 2, "title": "Tramp and Fish - Read by EL", "readers": [9872], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/tramp_and_fish_1508.poem_librivox/trampandfish_mcintyre_el_64kb.mp3", "duration": 88}, {"section": 3, "title": "Tramp and Fish - Read by GG", "readers": [8011], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/tramp_and_fish_1508.poem_librivox/trampandfish_mcintyre_gg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 104}, {"section": 4, "title": "Tramp and Fish - Read by JM", "readers": [9902], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/tramp_and_fish_1508.poem_librivox/trampandfish_mcintyre_jm_64kb.mp3", "duration": 82}, {"section": 5, "title": "Tramp and Fish - Read by LAH", "readers": [1212], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/tramp_and_fish_1508.poem_librivox/trampandfish_mcintyre_lah_64kb.mp3", "duration": 92}, {"section": 6, "title": "Tramp and Fish - Read by LCW", "readers": [8425], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/tramp_and_fish_1508.poem_librivox/trampandfish_mcintyre_lcw_64kb.mp3", "duration": 80}]}
