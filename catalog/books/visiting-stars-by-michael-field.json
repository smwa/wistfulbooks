{"title": "Visiting Stars", "description": "Michael Field was a pseudonym used for the poetry and verse drama of Katharine Harris Bradley (27 October 1846 \u2013 26 September 1914) and her niece and ward Edith Emma Cooper (12 January 1862 \u2013 13 December 1913). As Field they wrote around 40 works together, and a long journal Works and Days. Their intention was to keep the pen-name secret, but it became public knowledge, not long after they had confided in their friend Robert Browning. <br>\n\nThey wrote a number of passionate love poems to each other, and their name Michael Field was their way of declaring their inseparable oneness. Friends referred to them as the Fields, the Michaels or the Michael Fields. They had a range of pet names for each other. They also were passionately devoted to their pets, in particular a dog named Whym Chow, for whom they wrote a book of poems named after him. - Summary by Wikipedia", "duration": 980, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "9975", "name": "Michael Field"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/visiting_stars_1806.poem_librivox/visiting_stars_1806.jpg", "copyright_year": "1914", "genres": ["Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "David Lawrence"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Visiting Stars - Read by ALP", "readers": [4705], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/visiting_stars_1806.poem_librivox/visitingstars_field_alp_64kb.mp3", "duration": 72}, {"section": 2, "title": "Visiting Stars - Read by BK", "readers": [8786], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/visiting_stars_1806.poem_librivox/visitingstars_field_bk_64kb.mp3", "duration": 88}, {"section": 3, "title": "Visiting Stars - Read by EL", "readers": [9872], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/visiting_stars_1806.poem_librivox/visitingstars_field_el_64kb.mp3", "duration": 84}, {"section": 4, "title": "Visiting Stars - Read by FH", "readers": [12500], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/visiting_stars_1806.poem_librivox/visitingstars_field_fh_64kb.mp3", "duration": 65}, {"section": 5, "title": "Visiting Stars - Read by GG", "readers": [8011], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/visiting_stars_1806.poem_librivox/visitingstars_field_gg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 80}, {"section": 6, "title": "Visiting Stars - Read by GRS", "readers": [12484], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/visiting_stars_1806.poem_librivox/visitingstars_field_grs_64kb.mp3", "duration": 88}, {"section": 7, "title": "Visiting Stars - Read by IK", "readers": [7785], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/visiting_stars_1806.poem_librivox/visitingstars_field_ik_64kb.mp3", "duration": 85}, {"section": 8, "title": "Visiting Stars - Read by KJH", "readers": [8677], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/visiting_stars_1806.poem_librivox/visitingstars_field_kjh_64kb.mp3", "duration": 65}, {"section": 9, "title": "Visiting Stars - Read by LAH", "readers": [1212], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/visiting_stars_1806.poem_librivox/visitingstars_field_lah_64kb.mp3", "duration": 73}, {"section": 10, "title": "Visiting Stars - Read by LCW", "readers": [8425], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/visiting_stars_1806.poem_librivox/visitingstars_field_lcw_64kb.mp3", "duration": 68}, {"section": 11, "title": "Visiting Stars - Read by ND", "readers": [12565], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/visiting_stars_1806.poem_librivox/visitingstars_field_nd_64kb.mp3", "duration": 70}, {"section": 12, "title": "Visiting Stars - Read by RAJ", "readers": [12236], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/visiting_stars_1806.poem_librivox/visitingstars_field_raj_64kb.mp3", "duration": 70}, {"section": 13, "title": "Visiting Stars - Read by TP", "readers": [10789], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/visiting_stars_1806.poem_librivox/visitingstars_field_tp_64kb.mp3", "duration": 72}]}
