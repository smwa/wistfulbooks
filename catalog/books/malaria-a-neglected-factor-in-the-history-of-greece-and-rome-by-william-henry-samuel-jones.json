{"title": "Malaria: A Neglected Factor in the History of Greece and Rome", "description": "This short book has the objective of showing how important it is to stamp out malaria as soon as possible. Unlike a plague that suddenly takes it victims and leaves its survivors, malaria is a debilitating infection. It seizes all, fit and unfit alike, gradually lessening the general vitality until, in some cases, it has exterminated the people among whom it has become endemic. Extensive evidence has been compiled and summarised from consultation with medical authorities, antique literature, and historical sources to show how this insidious disease has undermined the integrity of a pair of ancient empires, and ultimately became a factor in their downfall. - Summary by Leon Harvey", "duration": 7664, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "16840", "name": "William Henry Samuel Jones"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/malaria_2205_librivox/malariaaneglected_2205.jpg", "copyright_year": "1907", "genres": ["Medical", "Social Science (Culture & Anthropology)", "Antiquity"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Leon Harvey"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Leon Harvey"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Amy Gramour"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Larry Wilson"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Preface", "readers": [10851], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/malaria_2205_librivox/malarianeglected_00_jones_64kb.mp3", "duration": 143}, {"section": 1, "title": "I.
