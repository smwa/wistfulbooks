{"title": "Hedge Fence", "description": "Twelve stories, one for each month of the year, which first list a few Bible verses then relate how those verses took effect in a young person's life. The first 10 chapters are letters written by Frank Hudson to his cousin Renie. Frank is a boy who gets into trouble when he doesn't think before acting. He receives Bible verses as a kind of \"hedge fence\" he has to jump through or climb over to do the wrong things; they scratch him and give him a prick, and remind him of what is the right way to go. The final two chapters are about Annie and David, aged 13 and 12 - little episodes in their life relating to a Bible verse, and how by heeding it, it made a difference to them. - Summary by TriciaG", "duration": 6141, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "157", "name": " Pansy"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/hedgefence_2209_librivox/hedgefence_2209.jpg", "copyright_year": "1884", "genres": ["Religion", "Christian Fiction"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "TriciaG"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "TriciaG"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "TriciaG"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Joy M."}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Why stand ye gazing up into Heaven?", "readers": [3157], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/hedgefence_2209_librivox/hedgefence_01_pansy_64kb.mp3", "duration": 527}, {"section": 2, "title": "If God be for us, who can be against us?", "readers": [3157], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/hedgefence_2209_librivox/hedgefence_02_pansy_64kb.mp3", "duration": 534}, {"section": 3, "title": "We ought to obey God rather than Men", "readers": [3157], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/hedgefence_2209_librivox/hedgefence_03_pansy_64kb.mp3", "duration": 509}, {"section": 4, "title": "Thy Heart is not right in the Sight of God", "readers": [3157], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/hedgefence_2209_librivox/hedgefence_04_pansy_64kb.mp3", "duration": 465}, {"section": 5, "title": "Separate me", "readers": [3157], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/hedgefence_2209_librivox/hedgefence_05_pansy_64kb.mp3", "duration": 419}, {"section": 6, "title": "Speaking boldly in the Lord", "readers": [3157], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/hedgefence_2209_librivox/hedgefence_06_pansy_64kb.mp3", "duration": 406}, {"section": 7, "title": "Be sure your Sin will find you out", "readers": [3157], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/hedgefence_2209_librivox/hedgefence_07_pansy_64kb.mp3", "duration": 582}, {"section": 8, "title": "And they forsook the Lord God of their Fathers", "readers": [3157], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/hedgefence_2209_librivox/hedgefence_08_pansy_64kb.mp3", "duration": 352}, {"section": 9, "title": "I have lent Him to the Lord", "readers": [3157], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/hedgefence_2209_librivox/hedgefence_09_pansy_64kb.mp3", "duration": 466}, {"section": 10, "title": "Hitherto hath the Lord helped us", "readers": [3157], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/hedgefence_2209_librivox/hedgefence_10_pansy_64kb.mp3", "duration": 618}, {"section": 11, "title": "With all your Heart", "readers": [3157], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/hedgefence_2209_librivox/hedgefence_11_pansy_64kb.mp3", "duration": 617}, {"section": 12, "title": "Christmas Practices", "readers": [3157], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/hedgefence_2209_librivox/hedgefence_12_pansy_64kb.mp3", "duration": 646}]}
