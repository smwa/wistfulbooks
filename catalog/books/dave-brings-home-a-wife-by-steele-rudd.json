{"title": "Dave Brings Home A Wife (dramatic reading)", "description": "This is a self-contained story-arc over eight chapters from the pages of Steele Rudd's book \"Back At Our Selection\".  The Synopsis:  After being a shy bachelor for a number of years, Dave (Dad Rudd's second eldest son) has finally got married.  To a \"Girl from Town\" named \"Lily White\".  When she first arrives at \"Ruddville\", she and Dave's sister Sarah get on wonderfully.  But after some months, friction between the two young woman sets in, and Dave and Lily seek to have a separate house of their own on the extensive Rudd property.  But Dad, though now a prosperous farmer, started out with his wife and children in a two-room settler's slab-hut, and has a notion ... exacerbated by tightfistedness ... that all young folk should start out their married life like that and work their way up.  So he finds, demolishes, carts, and re-erects a forty-year-old abandoned shack for his son and daughter-in-law.  They acquiesce to accepting it, and in time even become rather contented there.  But soon, Dave's mother-in-law arrives for a visit, and cranky old Dad Rudd finally meets his nemesis.   - Summary by Son of the Exiles\n<BR><BR>Cast list:<BR>\nDad Rudd, Australian farmer - Patriarch of the Rudd clan: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/8879\">Son of the Exiles</a><br>\nMother Rudd, wife of Dad Rudd: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/11790\">TJ Burns</a><br>\nDave Rudd, son of Dad Rudd: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/10789\">Tomas Peter</a><br>\nSarah Rudd, daughter of Dad Rudd: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/11772\">Linda Olsen Fitak</a><br>\nLily White, newly married to Dave: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/11084\">Devorah Allen</a><br>\nLily\u2019s Mother - Dave's mother-in-law: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/10179\">Sonia</a><br>\nJoe Rudd, son of Dad Rudd: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/11535\">Nemo</a><br>\nBill Rudd, son of Dad Rudd: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/12500\">Foon</a><br>\nBarty Rudd, son of Dad Rudd: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/12916\">Peter Musgrove</a><br>\nJimmy Regan - Neighbour to the Rudds: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/6754\">ToddHW</a><br>\nYoung Regan - Neighbour to the Rudds: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/10176\">Zoe Trang</a><br>\nWillie Wiley - Orphan boy adopted by one of Dad's neighbours: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/12500\">Foon</a><br>\nMary Murphy - Daughter of one of Dad's neighbours: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/10614\">Leanne Yau</a><br>\nThe Parson: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/8425\">Larry Wilson</a><br>\nMrs Walker: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/10087\">Sandra Schmit</a><br>\nBuilding Contractor: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/8425\">Larry Wilson</a><br>\nNarrator: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/6281\">Beth Thomas</a><br>\n<BR>This project was finished during the March Challenge with the precious help of the following six volunteer editors (thank you all) :<BR>\n<a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/12506\">Bhavya</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/13072\">Campbell Schelp</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/7079\">Chuck Williamson</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/12074\">JayS</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/5796\">linny</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/8051\">Maria Kasper</a>", "duration": 5966, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "10892", "name": "Steele Rudd"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/dave_brings_home_a_wife_1903_librivox/dave_brings_home_wife_1903.jpg", "copyright_year": "1906", "genres": ["Dramatic Readings", "Family Life", "Humorous Fiction"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Son of the Exiles"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Sonia"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Sonia"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Chapter 10 - Dave Brings Home a Wife", "readers": [], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/dave_brings_home_a_wife_1903_librivox/davebringshomeawife_01_rudd_64kb.mp3", "duration": 782}, {"section": 2, "title": "Chapter 11 - Dave's New House", "readers": [], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/dave_brings_home_a_wife_1903_librivox/davebringshomeawife_02_rudd_64kb.mp3", "duration": 921}, {"section": 3, "title": "Chapter 12 - Dave and Lily Start Housekeeping", "readers": [], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/dave_brings_home_a_wife_1903_librivox/davebringshomeawife_03_rudd_64kb.mp3", "duration": 673}, {"section": 4, "title": "Chapter 13 - Lily's Mother Arrives", "readers": [], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/dave_brings_home_a_wife_1903_librivox/davebringshomeawife_04_rudd_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1363}, {"section": 5, "title": "Chapter 14 - Lily's Mother Meets Dad", "readers": [], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/dave_brings_home_a_wife_1903_librivox/davebringshomeawife_05_rudd_64kb.mp3", "duration": 987}, {"section": 6, "title": "Chapter 15 - Dad Holds A Post Mortem", "readers": [], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/dave_brings_home_a_wife_1903_librivox/davebringshomeawife_06_rudd_64kb.mp3", "duration": 507}, {"section": 7, "title": "Chapter 16 - Dad Relents", "readers": [], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/dave_brings_home_a_wife_1903_librivox/davebringshomeawife_07_rudd_64kb.mp3", "duration": 341}, {"section": 8, "title": "Chapter 17 - Dad Forgets The Past", "readers": [], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/dave_brings_home_a_wife_1903_librivox/davebringshomeawife_08_rudd_64kb.mp3", "duration": 392}]}
