{"title": "Widowers' Houses", "description": "This is one of three plays Shaw published as Plays Unpleasant in 1898; they were termed \"unpleasant\" because they were intended, not to entertain their audiences\u2014as traditional Victorian theatre was expected to\u2014but to raise awareness of social problems and to censure exploitation of the laboring class by the unproductive rich. In this play, Dr. Harry Trench becomes disillusioned when he discovers how his fiancee's father, Mr. Sartorius, makes his money. However, it is soon revealed that Trench's own income is far from untainted.
