{"title": "Second Part of King Henry IV (version 2)", "description": "This sequel and third entry of the <i>Henriad</i> immediately follows the events of <a href=\"https://librivox.org/first-part-king-henry-iv-version-2-by-william-shakespeare/\"><i>Henry IV, Part 1</i></a> and the aftermath of the Battle of Shrewsbury, which saw the Percys\u2019 rebellion against the King quashed and its leader, Hotspur, killed in combat with the Prince of Wales. Upon hearing of Hotspur\u2019s death, his father, the Earl of Northumberland, vows to avenge him, and unites with the Archbishop of York and other discontented nobles to continue the civil unrest. Meanwhile, the boastful knight Falstaff\u2014having emerged from Shrewsbury with greater wealth and repute\u2014resumes his drunken misadventures in Eastcheap with a new page and swaggering ensign in tow, attracting the attentions of the coarse Doll Tearsheet and the ire of the impatient Mistress Quickly. His former companion Prince Hal, however, is now preoccupied with his father\u2019s failing health and the weight of responsibility that will soon accompany his ascendance to the throne. While the rebel leaders plot their next moves and Falstaff bumbles his way out of tight spots and helps to recruit forces for the coming skirmish, the stage is set for an inevitable transition of power. The question is: who will end up gaining the most, and who will come up short? With a tone that is at once raucous and mournful, this peculiar work forces us to meditate on disease, death and destiny in a way that only a master like Shakespeare can accomplish.<br><br>And to perform it all? Three men (<a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/11305\">Craig Franklin</a>, <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/10789\">Tomas Peter</a>, and <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/9905\">Brad \u201cHamlet\u201d Filippone</a>) and two women (<a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/13140\">Jenn Broda</a> and <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/13852\">Kelly S. Taylor</a>), determined to give you a performance of Shakespeare's work that you will never forget. You thought you knew your Shakespeare?
