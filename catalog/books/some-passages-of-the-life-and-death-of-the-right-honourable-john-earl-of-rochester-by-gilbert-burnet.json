It is in the hope that some of these persons, if they meet with and read this book, may have their eyes opened to the reckless folly of leading what is called 'a fast life\u2019, that I have had these pages reprinted. <br><br>\nIf objection be taken by the over-refined to the almost medical details recorded by Bishop Burnet, I can only say that I do not expect his work to be placed in the hands of young ladies.\n(Summary by Ronald Gower, Extracted from Preface)", "duration": 7789, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "10106", "name": "Gilbert Burnet"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/rh_john_earl_of_rochester_2102_librivox/liferochester_2102.jpg", "copyright_year": "1875", "genres": ["Christianity - Biographies"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "InTheDesert"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "InTheDesert"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Lynne T"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Rapunzelina"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Preface", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/rh_john_earl_of_rochester_2102_librivox/johnearlofrochester_00_burnet_64kb.mp3", "duration": 480}, {"section": 1, "title": "Section 1", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/rh_john_earl_of_rochester_2102_librivox/johnearlofrochester_01_burnet_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1215}, {"section": 2, "title": "Section 2", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/rh_john_earl_of_rochester_2102_librivox/johnearlofrochester_02_burnet_64kb.mp3", "duration": 905}, {"section": 3, "title": "Section 3", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/rh_john_earl_of_rochester_2102_librivox/johnearlofrochester_03_burnet_64kb.mp3", "duration": 989}, {"section": 4, "title": "Section 4", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/rh_john_earl_of_rochester_2102_librivox/johnearlofrochester_04_burnet_64kb.mp3", "duration": 912}, {"section": 5, "title": "Section 5", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/rh_john_earl_of_rochester_2102_librivox/johnearlofrochester_05_burnet_64kb.mp3", "duration": 986}, {"section": 6, "title": "Section 6", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/rh_john_earl_of_rochester_2102_librivox/johnearlofrochester_06_burnet_64kb.mp3", "duration": 892}, {"section": 7, "title": "Section 7", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/rh_john_earl_of_rochester_2102_librivox/johnearlofrochester_07_burnet_64kb.mp3", "duration": 457}, {"section": 8, "title": "Section 8", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/rh_john_earl_of_rochester_2102_librivox/johnearlofrochester_08_burnet_64kb.mp3", "duration": 642}, {"section": 9, "title": "Section 9", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/rh_john_earl_of_rochester_2102_librivox/johnearlofrochester_09_burnet_64kb.mp3", "duration": 311}]}
