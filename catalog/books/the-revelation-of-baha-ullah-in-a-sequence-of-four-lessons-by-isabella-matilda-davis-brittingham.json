{"title": "Revelation of Baha-ullah in a Sequence of Four Lessons", "description": "Isabella Matilda Davis Brittingham was a significant early American Bah\u00e1'\u00ed and was posthumously designated by Shoghi Effendi as one of the 19 Disciples of 'Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1 and Heralds of the Covenant. She was born in 1852, the daughter of Benjamin Davis, who was a grandson of John Morton, a signer of the Declaration of Independence. Her sister-in-law heard about the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith in 1897 and in 1898 Isabella herself became a part of the nascent American Bah\u00e1'\u00ed community. In September 1901, Isabella went on pilgrimage to the Holy Land, where she met 'Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1, the leader of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith and son of the Founder, Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h. She used the knowledge she gained there to write \"The Revelation of Baha-ullah in a Sequence of Four Lessons\", which was published by the Bahai Publishing Society of Chicago in 1902. There were nine editions of this work, the last being in 1920. It was one of the earliest accurate accounts of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith published in the West. The main purpose of the book is to demonstrate the truth of Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h's Revelation through Biblical prophecy.", "duration": 5934, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "4454", "name": " Isabella Matilda Davis Brittingham"}], "coverArt": "http://www.archive.org/download/librivox_cd_covers/revelation_bahaullah_four_lessons_brittingham.jpg", "copyright_year": "1902", "genres": ["Other religions"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Nicholas James Bridgewater"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Nicholas James Bridgewater"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Lucy Burgoyne (1950 - 2014)"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Chapter 1", "readers": [1618], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/revelation_bahaullah_librivox_njb/revelation_bahaullah_01_brittingham_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1785}, {"section": 2, "title": "Chapter 2", "readers": [1618], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/revelation_bahaullah_librivox_njb/revelation_bahaullah_02_brittingham_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1094}, {"section": 3, "title": "Chapter 3", "readers": [1618], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/revelation_bahaullah_librivox_njb/revelation_bahaullah_03_brittingham_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1502}, {"section": 4, "title": "Chapter 4", "readers": [1618], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/revelation_bahaullah_librivox_njb/revelation_bahaullah_04_brittingham_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1553}]}
