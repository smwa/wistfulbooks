{"title": "Seckatary Hawkins in Cuba", "description": "Seckatary Hawkins, the genial fat boy, is a favorite character with everyone who enjoys the deeds of a very real boy who manages to discover that adventure and mystery are not so very far off for one who looks for them. <br><br>\r\n\r\nIn Seckatary Hawkins in Cuba, he is embarked on that greatest of adventures, the search for hidden treasure. It is the hoard of old Cazanova in Cuba upon the quest for which young Hawkins is intent, and there are thrills and surprises and laughs aplenty in his narrative of the events encountered. <br><br>\r\n\r\nHawkins accompanies his friend \"Link, the Skinny Guy\", into the romantic West Indian island to obtain possession of an inheritance. They find themselves in a nest of mystery and experience ghastly happenings in the Cuban villa where they stay. Ghostly chains rattle, a figure in a portrait moves, a strange old man is caught robbing the house. The treasure map is discovered and the young fellows find that pirate gold may be found but that it is another matter to safely retain it. The climax comes when \"Skinny\" finds his mother, whom he thought was no longer living.
