{"title": "Pippa Passes", "description": "Pippa Passes was a dramatic piece, as much play as poetry, by Robert Browning published in 1841 as the first volume of his Bells and Pomegranates series.<br /><br />\nThe author described the work as the first of a series of dramatic pieces. His original idea was of a young, innocent girl, moving unblemished through the crime-ridden neighbourhoods of Asolo. The work caused outrage when it was first published, due to the matter-of-fact portrayals of many of the area's more disreputable characters \u2013 notably the adulterous Ottima \u2013 and for its frankness on sexual matters. Perhaps the most famous passage is below:<br><br>The year's at the spring,<br>\nAnd day's at the morn;<br>\nMorning's at seven;<br>\nThe hill-side's dew-pearled;<br>\nThe lark's on the wing;<br>\nThe snail's on the thorn;<br>\nGod's in his Heaven - <br>\nAll's right with the world!
