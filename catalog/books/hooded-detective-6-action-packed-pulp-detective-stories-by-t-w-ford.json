{"title": "Hooded Detective: 6 Action Packed Pulp Detective Stories", "description": "Evil lurks in the hearts and minds of men and many nefarious schemes are hatched by these gangsters, mob bosses and super villains.  But thankfully, equally brave, talented detectives (some of them hooded) are there to track them down and thwart their twisted plans.   These six stories, along with two \"true fact detective shorts\" were in the magazine Hooded Detective, January 1942.   Are they well written? well, no, but they are fun. Here are a few of the blurbs:   \"They had expected spaghetti with meat sauce for dinner, but were served instead, hot lead, with a little bit of blood on the side....\" (A Dinner Date with Murder)   \"Wilson Lamb cuddled his automatic to play \"Mr. Death\" and fingered little Louis Engel for coffin cargo. But when he pulled the trigger, Whisper the gun-cobra from Chi spilled out of Doom's deck..\" (Candidate for a Coffin).   How can you top that last sentence?  - Summary by Phil chenevert", "duration": 12202, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "12624", "name": "Cliff Campbell"}, {"id": "12623", "name": "J.
