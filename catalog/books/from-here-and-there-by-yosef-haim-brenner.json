The following words have influenced many at the time, and are still thought to represent Brenner's literary \"will\": \"Life is bad, but always secret ... Death is bad. The world is conflicted, but also diverse, and sometimes beautiful. The world is miserable, but can also be wonderful. The nation of Israel, by the rules of logic, has no future. One must, nonetheless, work. So long as you have a soul, there are sublime acts and uplifting moments. Long live Hebrew human labor!\" (Summary by Omri Lernau)", "duration": 28875, "language": "Hebrew", "authors": [{"id": "2333", "name": "\u05d9\u05d5\u05e1\u05e3 \u05d7\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd \u05d1\u05e8\u05e0\u05e8 Yosef Haim Brenner"}], "coverArt": "https://www.archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt4/fromherethere_1003.jpg", "copyright_year": "1911", "genres": ["General Fiction", "Published 1900 onward"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Omri Lernau"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Omri Lernau"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Laurie Anne Walden"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "First Notebook", "readers": [1574], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/from_here_and_there_ol_librivox/here_and_there_01_brenner_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1761}, {"section": 2, "title": "Second Notebook, Part 1", "readers": [1574], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/from_here_and_there_ol_librivox/here_and_there_02_brenner_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1100}, {"section": 3, "title": "Second Notebook, Part 2", "readers": [1574], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/from_here_and_there_ol_librivox/here_and_there_03_brenner_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1358}, {"section": 4, "title": "Second Notebook, Part 3", "readers": [1574], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/from_here_and_there_ol_librivox/here_and_there_04_brenner_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1321}, {"section": 5, "title": "Second Notebook, Part 4", "readers": [1574], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/from_here_and_there_ol_librivox/here_and_there_05_brenner_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1379}, {"section": 6, "title": "Second Notebook, Part 5", "readers": [1574], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/from_here_and_there_ol_librivox/here_and_there_06_brenner_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1573}, {"section": 7, "title": "Third Notebook, Part 1", "readers": [1574], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/from_here_and_there_ol_librivox/here_and_there_07_brenner_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1359}, {"section": 8, "title": "Third Notebook, Part 2", "readers": [1574], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/from_here_and_there_ol_librivox/here_and_there_08_brenner_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1416}, {"section": 9, "title": "Third Notebook, Part 3", "readers": [1574], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/from_here_and_there_ol_librivox/here_and_there_09_brenner_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1485}, {"section": 10, "title": "Third Notebook, Part 4", "readers": [1574], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/from_here_and_there_ol_librivox/here_and_there_10_brenner_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1295}, {"section": 11, "title": "Third Notebook, Part 5", "readers": [1574], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/from_here_and_there_ol_librivox/here_and_there_11_brenner_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1280}, {"section": 12, "title": "Fourth Notebook, Part 1", "readers": [1574], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/from_here_and_there_ol_librivox/here_and_there_12_brenner_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1870}, {"section": 13, "title": "Fourth Notebook, Part 2", "readers": [1574], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/from_here_and_there_ol_librivox/here_and_there_13_brenner_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2355}, {"section": 14, "title": "Fifth Notebook, Part 1", "readers": [1574], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/from_here_and_there_ol_librivox/here_and_there_14_brenner_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2196}, {"section": 15, "title": "Fifth Notebook, Part 2", "readers": [1574], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/from_here_and_there_ol_librivox/here_and_there_15_brenner_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1850}, {"section": 16, "title": "Sixth Notebook, Part 1", "readers": [1574], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/from_here_and_there_ol_librivox/here_and_there_16_brenner_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1330}, {"section": 17, "title": "Sixth Notebook, Part 2", "readers": [1574], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/from_here_and_there_ol_librivox/here_and_there_17_brenner_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1860}, {"section": 18, "title": "Sixth Notebook, Addendum, Parts 1 and 2", "readers": [1574], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/from_here_and_there_ol_librivox/here_and_there_18_brenner_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1286}, {"section": 19, "title": "Sixth Notebook, Addendum, Part 3", "readers": [1574], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/from_here_and_there_ol_librivox/here_and_there_19_brenner_64kb.mp3", "duration": 801}]}
