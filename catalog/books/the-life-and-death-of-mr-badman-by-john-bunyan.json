{"title": "Life and Death of Mr. Badman", "description": "Seventeenth-century Puritan theologian John Bunyan wrote The Life and Death of Mr. Badman as a companion piece to The Pilgrim\u2019s Progress, the literary work for which Bunyan is best remembered. Although both works are Christian allegories that provide the reader with moral and spiritual instruction, The Pilgrim\u2019s Progress accomplishes this goal primarily via the positive example of the protagonist, while The Life and Death of Mr. Badman does the opposite; Pilgrim is ultimately destined for heaven, while Mr. Badman is destined for hell. <br>\r\nThe two works also differ in their format. Pilgrim\u2019s story is presented as a dream sequence, while Mr. Badman\u2019s story is instead told via a dialogue between two other characters: Mr. Wiseman, who relates Mr. Badman\u2019s narrative and draws life lessons from it, and Mr. Attentive, who asks prompting questions and makes comments on the tale he hears. Throughout the story, Bunyan details a variety of Mr. Badman\u2019s sins including lying, swearing, and Sabbath-breaking. <br>\r\nDespite its length, the original text was one continuous narrative without chapter breaks.  This LibriVox production is presented as dialogue by two readers and divided into smaller parts for convenience.<br>\r\n - Summary by David Purdy<br><br>\r\nPreface and narration, voiced by <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/13278\">KevinS</a><br>\r\nMr Attentive, voiced by <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/10542\">David Purdy</a><br>\r\nMr Wiseman, voiced by <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/8425\">Larry Wilson</a><br>\r\n\r\n", "duration": 26003, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "4196", "name": " John Bunyan"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/badman_2112_librivox/mr_badman_2112.jpg", "copyright_year": "1905", "genres": ["Christian Fiction"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Larry Wilson"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Rapunzelina"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "pattymarie"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Preface", "readers": [13278], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/badman_2112_librivox/badman_00_bunyan_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1567}, {"section": 1, "title": "Part 1", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/badman_2112_librivox/badman_01_bunyan_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1189}, {"section": 2, "title": "Part 2", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/badman_2112_librivox/badman_02_bunyan_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1392}, {"section": 3, "title": "Part 3", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/badman_2112_librivox/badman_03_bunyan_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1252}, {"section": 4, "title": "Part 4", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/badman_2112_librivox/badman_04_bunyan_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1400}, {"section": 5, "title": "Part 5", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/badman_2112_librivox/badman_05_bunyan_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1381}, {"section": 6, "title": "Part 6", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/badman_2112_librivox/badman_06_bunyan_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1149}, {"section": 7, "title": "Part 7", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/badman_2112_librivox/badman_07_bunyan_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1372}, {"section": 8, "title": "Part 8", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/badman_2112_librivox/badman_08_bunyan_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1210}, {"section": 9, "title": "Part 9", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/badman_2112_librivox/badman_09_bunyan_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1077}, {"section": 10, "title": "Part 10", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/badman_2112_librivox/badman_10_bunyan_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1387}, {"section": 11, "title": "Part 11", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/badman_2112_librivox/badman_11_bunyan_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1363}, {"section": 12, "title": "Part 12", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/badman_2112_librivox/badman_12_bunyan_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1542}, {"section": 13, "title": "Part 13", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/badman_2112_librivox/badman_13_bunyan_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1418}, {"section": 14, "title": "Part 14", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/badman_2112_librivox/badman_14_bunyan_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1296}, {"section": 15, "title": "Part 15", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/badman_2112_librivox/badman_15_bunyan_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1275}, {"section": 16, "title": "Part 16", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/badman_2112_librivox/badman_16_bunyan_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1217}, {"section": 17, "title": "Part 17", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/badman_2112_librivox/badman_17_bunyan_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1385}, {"section": 18, "title": "Part 18", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/badman_2112_librivox/badman_18_bunyan_64kb.mp3", "duration": 778}, {"section": 19, "title": "Part 19", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/badman_2112_librivox/badman_19_bunyan_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1353}]}
