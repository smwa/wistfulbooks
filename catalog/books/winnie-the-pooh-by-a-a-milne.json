{"title": "Winnie-the-Pooh", "description": "Winnie the Pooh, the loveable little bear with a great big heart (and only a slightly less large appetite for honey), has fun and adventures in this book.  All of the other residents of the 100 acre wood join in to help this happen.  Rabbit, Piglet, Owl, Kanga and Roo and of course the every depressed Eeyore who manages to lose his tail somehow.   But what more needs to be said except that it Christopher Robin and Pooh are here? Listen and enjoy.  - Summary by phil chenevert", "duration": 10469, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "1259", "name": "A. A.
