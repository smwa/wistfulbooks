{"title": "Wild and romantic: Early guides to the English lake district", "description": "A collection of some of the most significant literary work on the English Lake District prior to Thomas West\u2019s A guide to the Lakes (1778). The poet Thomas Gray takes the reader from Brough south to Kendal on his return from a tour in Scotland. An agricultural reformer, Arthur Young, also returning from Scotland, begins his journey in the northern parts of Cumberland with dry descriptions of local farming, but on arriving in Keswick, his account turns to the picturesque scenery around Derwent Water, Ullswater and Windermere. \u2018Wild and romantic\u2019 is Young\u2019s phrase, yet the agriculturalist in him comes to the fore as he declares the enclosed landscapes around Kendal and Windermere to be the most picturesque of all. Thomas Pennant\u2019s account of his journey through the district is cursory, and he seems not have noticed the lakes or mountains at all. West\u2019s Guide quotes Gray, Young and Pennant, and its second edition included the full text of Gray\u2019s unpublished letters as an addendum. It also included four short pieces. John Brown\u2019s letter to his former pupil William Gilpin (who would become the foremost exponent of the \u2018picturesque\u2019) connects the scenery of the Lakes to European landscape painting. Experimental philosopher Adam Walker provides a note on a local curiosity, the underground passages of Dunald Mill Hole. John Dalton and Richard Cumberland were among the first in a long line of Lakeland poets to be inspired to verse.>\n - Summary by Phil Benson", "duration": 8030, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "15534", "name": "John Brown"}, {"id": "14616", "name": "Richard Cumberland"}, {"id": "6701", "name": "John Dalton"}, {"id": "536", "name": "Thomas Gray"}, {"id": "14605", "name": "Thomas Pennant"}, {"id": "14603", "name": "Adam Walker"}, {"id": "14604", "name": "Arthur Young"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/wildandromantic_1912_librivox/wild_romantic_1912.jpg", "copyright_year": "1802", "genres": ["Travel & Geography"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Phil Benson"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Phil Benson"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Annise"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Newgatenovelist"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Dr. Brown\u2019s letter, describing the vale and lake of Keswick (1741-47) by John Brown", "readers": [6097], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/wildandromantic_1912_librivox/earlyguides_01_various_64kb.mp3", "duration": 477}, {"section": 2, "title": "Extract from A descriptive poem: addressed to two ladies, at their return from viewing the mines near Whitehaven (1755) by John Dalton", "readers": [6097], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/wildandromantic_1912_librivox/earlyguides_02_various_64kb.mp3", "duration": 210}, {"section": 3, "title": "A description of Dunald Mill Hole (1760) by A.W.
