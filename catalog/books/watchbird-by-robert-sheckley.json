{"title": "Watchbird", "description": "3 Robert Sheckley short stories that demonstrate the breadth of his fantastic imagination.  In Watchbird, the question \"can machines solve human problems?\" is answered with a resounding YES! But there may be a few unforeseen glitches.  Just a few. Warrior Race drops us into an alien race of warriors who fight in a way you will never be able to imagine until you listen.  And Beside Still Waters is a gentle story that shows us a man who really wants to get away from it all ... sitting on a rock in the asteroid belt with only a robot for a friend.  No girls allowed!  A poignant and unsettling story to say the least.", "duration": 5426, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "741", "name": "Robert Sheckley"}], "coverArt": "http://archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt24/Watchbird_1211.jpg", "copyright_year": "1951", "genres": ["Science Fiction"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "DaveC"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "1 - Watchbird, part 1", "readers": [5717], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/watchbird_pc_librivox/watchbird_1_sheckley_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1550}, {"section": 2, "title": "2 - Watchbird, part 2", "readers": [5717], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/watchbird_pc_librivox/watchbird_2_sheckley_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1543}, {"section": 3, "title": "3 - Warrior Race", "readers": [5717], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/watchbird_pc_librivox/watchbird_3_sheckley_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1725}, {"section": 4, "title": "4 - Beside Still Waters", "readers": [5717], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/watchbird_pc_librivox/watchbird_4_sheckley_64kb.mp3", "duration": 608}]}
