{"title": "Greetings from Longfellow", "description": "This is a wonderful selection of six of the greatest works from Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, unquestionably one of the world's most celebrated poets. Despite its small size, the book covers a wide spectrum of the poet's thoughts and ideas, from those on patriotism, to the inherent uncertainty of the human condition, to hope for the future - and all with a strong faith in the ability of humanity to see life through successfully. These themes, coupled with an overall tenor of joy and optimism in the face of challenges inherent in the struggle for mankind's survival, make this work a most enjoyable addition to the library of a poet of Longfellow's distinction.  - Summary by Bruce Kachuk", "duration": 647, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "43", "name": "Henry Wadsworth Longfellow"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/greetings_from_longfellow_2111_librivox/greetings_longfellow_2111.jpg", "copyright_year": "1907", "genres": ["Single author"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Bruce Kachuk"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Bruce Kachuk"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Sonia"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Rapunzelina"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Sail On, O Ship of State!", "readers": [8786], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/greetings_from_longfellow_2111_librivox/greetings_1_longfellow_64kb.mp3", "duration": 108}, {"section": 2, "title": "Something Left Undone", "readers": [8786], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/greetings_from_longfellow_2111_librivox/greetings_2_longfellow_64kb.mp3", "duration": 85}, {"section": 3, "title": "The Ladder of St. Augustine", "readers": [8786], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/greetings_from_longfellow_2111_librivox/greetings_3_longfellow_64kb.mp3", "duration": 90}, {"section": 4, "title": "Evangeline", "readers": [8786], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/greetings_from_longfellow_2111_librivox/greetings_4_longfellow_64kb.mp3", "duration": 128}, {"section": 5, "title": "O Little Feet!
