Do we stand for that sort of thing, or shall we accept the dare?\u201d \u201cThere are half a dozen and more of the enemy against four Outdoor Chums, but what of that? This is the first snow of the fall, with a real tang in the air. Say yes, Frank, and let\u2019s get busy!\u201d \u201cHere are Bluff and Jerry ready to eat up that crowd in a snowball fight. What do you say, Will?\u201d \u201cOh, count me in, because I can see they\u2019re just spoiling for it!\u201d exclaimed the fourth boy in the party, who did not look quite so hardy as his comrades, although no weakling. \u201cWell, I should think it\u2019d be a shame to miss it, when the snow is just soft enough to handle easily,\u201d and Jerry Wellington held up a big round ball he had quickly manipulated in his practiced hands. \u201cThat settles it. Everybody get busy making a supply of ammunition. Then we\u2019ll charge their line, and give them as good as they send!\u201d (Summary by Author in Chapter 1 - The Snowball Battle)", "duration": 16342, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id":
