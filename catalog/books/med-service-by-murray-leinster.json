{"title": "Med Service", "description": "Excitement would seem far from the life of a Med Service man.  Going from planet to planet in their tiny ships with just one little furry companion for company the vast number of human inhabited planets spread throughout the galaxy, spreading new medical knowledge in a semi-official way would seem humdrum and boring.  But sometimes it gets way too exciting and this is the tale of one of those times.  This planet tries to kill them and Calhoun  and Mugratroid find themselves crash landed on a plague ridden globe, hunted and in mortal danger.  And there are the surviving plague victims of course. Can they survive?  Med Service men are resourceful and hard to kill.  Listen  and find out.
