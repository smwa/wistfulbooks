{"title": "Christian Mythology", "description": "\"Knowledge is power, but ignorance is the mother of devotion.\"\r\nChristianity, like all other religions, came not into the world full-grown, but from the simple conceptions of its early followers became gradually elaborated by the introduction of pagan forms and customs until it supplanted its early rivals and gave its adherents a compact and solid theology not very different from that of its predecessors\u2026.\r\nProbably the true source of that human characteristic which is defined as the religious instinct and which is supposed to be an elevating and moral agent, is to be found in the superstition which originated in fear of the unknown\u2026.\r\nIn our perusal of the subject, we shall first consider the life of Jesus as taught by the Christian church; secondly, the dogmas affecting the source of his power and the results of his influence; and, thirdly, the rites and ceremonies with which his worship is performed.\r\n[from the Preface] ", "duration": 15580, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "14997", "name": "Ethel Brigham Leatherbee"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/christianmythology_2512_librivox/christianmythology_2512.jpg", "copyright_year": "1915", "genres": ["Christianity - Commentary"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Louise J.
