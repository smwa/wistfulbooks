{"title": "Essay on Man", "description": "Pope\u2019s Essay on Man, a masterpiece of concise summary in itself, can fairly be summed up as an optimistic enquiry into mankind\u2019s place in the vast Chain of Being.<br /><br />\n\nEach of the poem\u2019s four Epistles takes a different perspective, presenting Man in relation to the universe, as individual, in society and, finally, tracing his prospects for achieving the goal of happiness.<br /><br />\n\nIn choosing stately rhyming couplets to explore his theme, Pope sometimes becomes obscure through compressing his language overmuch. By and large, the work is a triumphant exercise in philosophical poetry, communicating its broad and commonplace truths in superbly balanced phrases which remind us that Pope, alas, is one of the most quoted but least read writers in English:<br /><br />\n\n\u201cHope springs eternal in the human breast: Man never is, but always To be Blest.\u201d\n(Summary by Martin Geeson)", "duration": 6472, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "1231", "name": "Alexander Pope"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt20/Essay_Man_1206.jpg", "copyright_year": "1733", "genres": ["General Fiction", "Poetry", "*Non-fiction"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Martin Geeson"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Martin Geeson"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Joy Easton"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Author's Preface", "readers": [3595], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/essay_on_man_0909_librivox/anessayonman_00_pope_64kb.mp3", "duration": 300}, {"section": 1, "title": "Epistle I", "readers": [3595], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/essay_on_man_0909_librivox/anessayonman_01_pope_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1385}, {"section": 2, "title": "Epistle II", "readers": [3595], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/essay_on_man_0909_librivox/anessayonman_02_pope_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1374}, {"section": 3, "title": "Epistle III", "readers": [3595], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/essay_on_man_0909_librivox/anessayonman_03_pope_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1543}, {"section": 4, "title": "Epistle IV", "readers": [3595], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/essay_on_man_0909_librivox/anessayonman_04_pope_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1870}]}
