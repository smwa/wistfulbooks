{"title": "Cave Girl", "description": "Blueblooded mama's boy Waldo Emerson Smith-Jones is swept overboard during a south seas voyage for his lifelong ill health. He finds himself on a jungle island. His bookish education has not prepared him to cope with these surroundings, and he is a coward. He is terrified when he encounters primitive, violent men, ape-like throwbacks in mankind's evolutionary history. He runs from them, but when he reaches a dead end, he successfully makes a stand, astonishing himself. While keeping the hairy brutes at bay, he meets a beautiful girl, Nadara, also on the run. In an uncharacteristic gesture, he saves her from the grasp of one ape-man during their escape. - Summary by Wikipedia", "duration": 13000, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "698", "name": "Edgar Rice Burroughs"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/cave_girl_2010_librivox/cave_girl_2010.jpg", "copyright_year": "1913", "genres": ["Action & Adventure Fiction"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Lucy Lo Faro"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Annise"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Flotsam", "readers": [2312], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/cave_girl_2010_librivox/cave_girl_01_burroughs_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1247}, {"section": 2, "title": "The Wild People", "readers": [2312], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/cave_girl_2010_librivox/cave_girl_02_burroughs_64kb.mp3", "duration": 925}, {"section": 3, "title": "The little Eden", "readers": [2312], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/cave_girl_2010_librivox/cave_girl_03_burroughs_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1352}, {"section": 4, "title": "Death's Doorway", "readers": [2312], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/cave_girl_2010_librivox/cave_girl_04_burroughs_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1391}, {"section": 5, "title": "The Awakening", "readers": [2312], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/cave_girl_2010_librivox/cave_girl_05_burroughs_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1653}, {"section": 6, "title": "A Choice", "readers": [2312], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/cave_girl_2010_librivox/cave_girl_06_burroughs_64kb.mp3", "duration": 956}, {"section": 7, "title": "Thandar, the Seeker", "readers": [2312], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/cave_girl_2010_librivox/cave_girl_07_burroughs_64kb.mp3", "duration": 979}, {"section": 8, "title": "Nadara Again", "readers": [2312], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/cave_girl_2010_librivox/cave_girl_08_burroughs_64kb.mp3", "duration": 613}, {"section": 9, "title": "The Seeker", "readers": [251], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/cave_girl_2010_librivox/cave_girl_09_burroughs_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1155}, {"section": 10, "title": "The Trail's End", "readers": [251], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/cave_girl_2010_librivox/cave_girl_10_burroughs_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1083}, {"section": 11, "title": "Capture", "readers": [251], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/cave_girl_2010_librivox/cave_girl_11_burroughs_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1646}]}
