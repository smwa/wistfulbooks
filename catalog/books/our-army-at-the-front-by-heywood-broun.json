{"title": "Our Army at the Front", "description": "During the US deployment in Europe in the final years of the Great War (WWI), the American Expeditionary Force (AEF) was accompanied by notable New York Tribune war correspondent, Heywood Broun. Although Broun better known (and remembered) as a sports writer, drama critic, journalist and social reformer, and not least as a member of the Algonquin Round Table, with such wits as Dorothy Parker and Robert Benchley, his writing of the activities of the AEF as it helped defeat the Central Powers in the war provides a unique perspective, including a view of the international interaction between the Americans and their European allies.<br><br>\nThe work concludes by reprinting the initial report to the Secretary of Defense by American General John J. (Black Jack) Pershing who was the commander of the AEF, and contains detailed information regarding the level of the US effort and something of the obstacles which had to be overcome for the AEF efforts to be successful.
