{"title": "Pomes Penyeach", "description": "James Joyce published three volumes of poetry during his lifetime including Pomes Penyeach. This simple booklet was published in 1927 in Paris. The poems were written over a twenty-year period beginning in 1904 and are arranged chronologically in the booklet.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThis thin collection reveals some of Joyce's humor. \"Pomes Penyeach\" plays with the French word for apples---pommes. The booklet was sold for a shilling, that is 12 pennies. (12 francs.) That the collection of poems is actually 13 in number mirrors the Irish tradition of the \"tilly,\" something like the well-known baker's dozen. In fact, the first poem's title is \"Tilly.\" The wrap of the booklet was printed on apple green colored paper.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThese details must be credited to Richard Ellmann.
