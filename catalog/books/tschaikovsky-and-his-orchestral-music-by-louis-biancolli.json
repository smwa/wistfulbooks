{"title": "Tschaikovsky And His Orchestral Music", "description": "Included in this little book are analyses and backgrounds of most of Tschaikowsky\u2019s standard concert music. A short sketch of Tschaikowsky\u2019s life precedes the section devoted to the orchestral music. Yet, the personal outlook and moods of Russia\u2019s great composer are so inextricably bound up with his music, that actually the whole booklet is an account of his strangely tormented life. In the story of Tschaikowsky, life and art weave into one closely knit fabric. It is hoped that this simple narrative will aid music lovers to glimpse the great pathos and struggle behind the music of this sad and lonely man. - Summary by Author's Foreword", "duration": 5231, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "12205", "name": "Louis Biancolli"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt22/tschaikowskymusic_1607.jpg", "copyright_year": "1950", "genres": ["Biography & Autobiography", "Music"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "David Wales"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "David Wales"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Ann Boulais"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "DaveC"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Foreword", "readers": [6454], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/tschaikovsky_orchestral_music_dw_1607_librivox/tsaikowskymusic_00_biancolli_64kb.mp3", "duration": 72}, {"section": 1, "title": "Part 1: Opening Biography; Marches, Overtures, Fantasias, Etc.; Overture 1812, Opus 49; Capriccio Italien, Opus 45; Suite For Strings, Souvenir de Florence, Opus 70Opening Biography; Marches, Overtures, Fantasias, Etc.; Overture 1812, Opus 49; Capriccio Italien, Opus 45; Suite For Strings, Souvenir de Florence, Opus 70", "readers": [6454], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/tschaikovsky_orchestral_music_dw_1607_librivox/tsaikowskymusic_01_biancolli_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1582}, {"section": 2, "title": "Part 2: Overture-Fantasy, Romeo and Juliet; Francesca da Rimini, Fantasie For Orchestra (After Dante), Opus 32; Ballet Suites: Suite From The Ballet, Swan Lake (Le Lac des Cygnes) \u2013 Suite From The Ballet, The Sleeping Beauty, Opus 66 \u2013 Suite From The Ballet, The Nutcracker, Opus 71-a; Concertos: Concerto For Violin And Orchestra, in D Major, Opus 35 \u2013 Concerto For Piano And Orchestra, in B-Flat Minor, No. 1, Opus 23", "readers": [6454], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/tschaikovsky_orchestral_music_dw_1607_librivox/tsaikowskymusic_02_biancolli_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2028}, {"section": 3, "title": "Part 3: Symphonies: Symphony In F Minor, No. 4, Opus 36 \u2013 symphony In E Minor, No. 5, Opus 64 \u2013 Symphony In B  Minor, No. 6, Opus 74 Pathetic; Death", "readers": [6454], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/tschaikovsky_orchestral_music_dw_1607_librivox/tsaikowskymusic_03_biancolli_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1549}]}
