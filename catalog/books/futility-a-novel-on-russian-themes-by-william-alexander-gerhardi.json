{"title": "Futility: A Novel on Russian Themes", "description": "From the preface written by Edith Wharton:<br /><br />\nThen I fell upon Futility. Some one said: \u201cIt's another new novel about Russia\u201d \u2013and every one of my eager feelers curled up in a tight knot of refusal. But . . . I read on, amused, moved, absorbed, till the tale and the journey ended together.<br /><br />\nThis, it seems to me, is the most striking quality of Mr. Gerhardi's book: that he has (even in this, his first venture) enough of the true novelist's \u201cobjectivity\u201d to focus the two so utterly alien races to whom he belongs almost equally, by birth and bringing-up \u2013 the English and the Russian \u2013 to sympathize with both, and to depict them for us as they see each other, with the play of their mutual reactions illuminating and animating them all.  - Summary from the preface by Edith Wharton", "duration": 24640, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "10478", "name": "William Alexander Gerhardi"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt17/futility_1408.jpg", "copyright_year": "1922", "genres": ["Published 1900 onward"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Margaret Espaillat"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Margaret Espaillat"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Bev J Stevens"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "DaveC"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Preface", "readers": [4064], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/futilitynovelrussianthemes_1407_librivox/futility_00_gerhardi_64kb.mp3", "duration": 306}, {"section": 1, "title": "Part 1, Chapters 1-5", "readers": [4064], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/futilitynovelrussianthemes_1407_librivox/futility_01_gerhardi_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2675}, {"section": 2, "title": "Part 1, Chapters 6-8", "readers": [4064], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/futilitynovelrussianthemes_1407_librivox/futility_02_gerhardi_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1836}, {"section": 3, "title": "Part 1, Chapters 9-11", "readers": [4064], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/futilitynovelrussianthemes_1407_librivox/futility_03_gerhardi_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2431}, {"section": 4, "title": "Part 2", "readers": [4064], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/futilitynovelrussianthemes_1407_librivox/futility_04_gerhardi_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2401}, {"section": 5, "title": "Part 3, Chapters 1-2", "readers": [4064], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/futilitynovelrussianthemes_1407_librivox/futility_05_gerhardi_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2393}, {"section": 6, "title": "Part 3, Chapters 3-4", "readers": [4064], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/futilitynovelrussianthemes_1407_librivox/futility_06_gerhardi_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2927}, {"section": 7, "title": "Part 3, Chapters 5-7", "readers": [4064], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/futilitynovelrussianthemes_1407_librivox/futility_07_gerhardi_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2099}, {"section": 8, "title": "Part 3, Chapters 8-10", "readers": [4064], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/futilitynovelrussianthemes_1407_librivox/futility_08_gerhardi_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2839}, {"section": 9, "title": "Part 3, Chapters 11-12", "readers": [4064], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/futilitynovelrussianthemes_1407_librivox/futility_09_gerhardi_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1560}, {"section": 10, "title": "Part 4, Chapters 1-3", "readers": [4064], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/futilitynovelrussianthemes_1407_librivox/futility_10_gerhardi_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1715}, {"section": 11, "title": "Part 4, Chapters 4-6", "readers": [4064], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/futilitynovelrussianthemes_1407_librivox/futility_11_gerhardi_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1458}]}
