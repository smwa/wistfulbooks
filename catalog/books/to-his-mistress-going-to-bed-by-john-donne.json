{"title": "To His Mistress Going to Bed", "description": "John Donne was an English poet and cleric in the Church of England.\n\nHe is considered the pre-eminent representative of the metaphysical poets. His works are noted for their strong, sensual style and include sonnets, love poems, religious poems, Latin translations, epigrams, elegies, songs, satires and sermons. His poetry is noted for its vibrancy of language and inventiveness of metaphor, especially compared to that of his contemporaries. Donne's style is characterised by abrupt openings and various paradoxes, ironies and dislocations. These features, along with his frequent dramatic or everyday speech rhythms, his tense syntax and his tough eloquence, were both a reaction against the smoothness of conventional Elizabethan poetry and an adaptation into English of European baroque and mannerist techniques.  - Summary by Wikipedia", "duration": 2614, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "742", "name": "John Donne"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/to_his_mistress_going_to_bed_1702.poem_librivox/mistressbed_1703.jpg", "copyright_year": "0", "genres": ["Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "To His Mistress Going to Bed - Read by ALP", "readers": [4705], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/to_his_mistress_going_to_bed_1702.poem_librivox/goingtobed_donne_alp_64kb.mp3", "duration": 206}, {"section": 2, "title": "To His Mistress Going to Bed - Read by DM", "readers": [11341], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/to_his_mistress_going_to_bed_1702.poem_librivox/goingtobed_donne_dm_64kb.mp3", "duration": 230}, {"section": 3, "title": "To His Mistress Going to Bed - Read by EL", "readers": [9872], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/to_his_mistress_going_to_bed_1702.poem_librivox/goingtobed_donne_el_64kb.mp3", "duration": 227}, {"section": 4, "title": "To His Mistress Going to Bed - Read by GG", "readers": [8011], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/to_his_mistress_going_to_bed_1702.poem_librivox/goingtobed_donne_gg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 222}, {"section": 5, "title": "To His Mistress Going to Bed - Read by JA", "readers": [11500], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/to_his_mistress_going_to_bed_1702.poem_librivox/goingtobed_donne_ja_64kb.mp3", "duration": 151}, {"section": 6, "title": "To His Mistress Going to Bed - Read by JCB", "readers": [11064], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/to_his_mistress_going_to_bed_1702.poem_librivox/goingtobed_donne_jcb_64kb.mp3", "duration": 228}, {"section": 7, "title": "To His Mistress Going to Bed - Read by MSD", "readers": [10891], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/to_his_mistress_going_to_bed_1702.poem_librivox/goingtobed_donne_msd_64kb.mp3", "duration": 221}, {"section": 8, "title": "To His Mistress Going to Bed - Read by PJW", "readers": [6609], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/to_his_mistress_going_to_bed_1702.poem_librivox/goingtobed_donne_pjw_64kb.mp3", "duration": 237}, {"section": 9, "title": "To His Mistress Going to Bed - Read by TA", "readers": [10289], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/to_his_mistress_going_to_bed_1702.poem_librivox/goingtobed_donne_ta_64kb.mp3", "duration": 236}, {"section": 10, "title": "To His Mistress Going to Bed - Read by TP", "readers": [10789], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/to_his_mistress_going_to_bed_1702.poem_librivox/goingtobed_donne_tp_64kb.mp3", "duration": 207}, {"section": 11, "title": "To His Mistress Going to Bed - Read by VB", "readers": [8169], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/to_his_mistress_going_to_bed_1702.poem_librivox/goingtobed_donne_vb_64kb.mp3", "duration": 257}, {"section": 12, "title": "To His Mistress Going to Bed - Read by VLR", "readers": [11358], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/to_his_mistress_going_to_bed_1702.poem_librivox/goingtobed_donne_vlr_64kb.mp3", "duration": 192}]}
