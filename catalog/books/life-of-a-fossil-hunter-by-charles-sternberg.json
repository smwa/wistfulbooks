{"title": "Life of a Fossil Hunter", "description": "Charles Sternberg was an American fossil collector and paleontologist. He was active in both fields from 1876 to 1928, and collected fossils for private collectors as well as for international museums. This book is part travelogue, part paleontology, and part historical narrative of life on the open prairie. In it, Sternberg tells of his early interest in fossil hunting as a boy, and scientific expeditions from his first in 1876 to one for the Munich Museum in 1901.  - Summary by Ava", "duration": 26135, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "14958", "name": "Charles Sternberg"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/life_of_a_fossil_hunter_2008_librivox/fossilhunter_2008.jpg", "copyright_year": "1909", "genres": ["Animals", "Memoirs", "Earth Sciences"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Availle"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Availle"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "ADKreader"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Preface and Introduction", "readers": [4174], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/life_of_a_fossil_hunter_2008_librivox/lifefossilhunter_00_sternberg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 341}, {"section": 1, "title": "Early Days and Work in the Dakota Group of the Cretaceous", "readers": [13577], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/life_of_a_fossil_hunter_2008_librivox/lifefossilhunter_01_sternberg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2719}, {"section": 2, "title": "First Expedition to the Kansas Chalk (1876)", "readers": [13577], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/life_of_a_fossil_hunter_2008_librivox/lifefossilhunter_02_sternberg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2584}, {"section": 3, "title": "Expedition with Professor Cope to the Bad Lands of the Upper Cretaceous (1876) - Part 1", "readers": [14011], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/life_of_a_fossil_hunter_2008_librivox/lifefossilhunter_03_sternburg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1906}, {"section": 4, "title": "Expedition with Professor Cope to the Bad Lands of the Upper Cretaceous (1876) - Part 2", "readers": [14011], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/life_of_a_fossil_hunter_2008_librivox/lifefossilhunter_04_sternburg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1934}, {"section": 5, "title": "Further Work in the Kansas Chalk (1877)", "readers": [14250], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/life_of_a_fossil_hunter_2008_librivox/lifefossilhunter_05_sternberg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1942}, {"section": 6, "title": "Discovery of the Loup Fork Beds of Kansas and Subsequent Work There (1877, 1882\u20131884)", "readers": [14250], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/life_of_a_fossil_hunter_2008_librivox/lifefossilhunter_06_sternberg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2277}, {"section": 7, "title": "Expedition to the Oregon Desert in 1877", "readers": [14250], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/life_of_a_fossil_hunter_2008_librivox/lifefossilhunter_07_sternberg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2414}, {"section": 8, "title": "Expedition to the John Day River in 1878 - Part 1", "readers": [13075], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/life_of_a_fossil_hunter_2008_librivox/lifefossilhunter_08_sternberg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1475}, {"section": 9, "title": "Expedition to the John Day River in 1878 - Part 2", "readers": [13075], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/life_of_a_fossil_hunter_2008_librivox/lifefossilhunter_09_sternberg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1855}, {"section": 10, "title": "First Expedition to the Permian of Texas in 1882", "readers": [13075], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/life_of_a_fossil_hunter_2008_librivox/lifefossilhunter_10_sternberg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2329}, {"section": 11, "title": "Expeditions in the Permian of Texas for Professor Cope (1895\u20131897)", "readers": [4174], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/life_of_a_fossil_hunter_2008_librivox/lifefossilhunter_11_sternberg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1261}, {"section": 12, "title": "In the Red Beds of Texas for the Royal Museum of Munich (1901)", "readers": [6754], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/life_of_a_fossil_hunter_2008_librivox/lifefossilhunter_12_sternberg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1708}, {"section": 13, "title": "Conclusion", "readers": [6754], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/life_of_a_fossil_hunter_2008_librivox/lifefossilhunter_13_sternberg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1390}]}
