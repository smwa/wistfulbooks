Streets, in a letter accompanying later poems, also wrote: \"They were inspired while I was in the trenches, where I have been so busy that I have had little time to polish them. I have tried to picture some thoughts that pass through a man's brain when he dies. I may not see the end of the poems, but hope to live to do so. We soldiers have our views of life to express, though the boom of death is in our ears. We try to convey something of what we feel in this great conflict to those who think of us, and sometimes, alas! mourn our loss. We desire to let them know that in the midst of our keenest sadness for the joy of life we leave behind we go to meet death grim-lipped, clear-eyed, and resolute-hearted.\"<br /><br />\n\nHe didn't survive, killed in action on 1st July 1916. - Summary by Ruth Golding", "duration": 1104, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "11662", "name": "John William Streets"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/challenge_1511_poem_librivox/challenge_1511.jpg", "copyright_year": "1916", "genres": ["Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Ruth Golding"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Ruth Golding"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Challenge - Read by ALP", "readers": [4705], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/challenge_1511_poem_librivox/challenge_streets_alp_64kb.mp3", "duration": 71}, {"section": 2, "title": "Challenge - Read by BK", "readers": [8786], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/challenge_1511_poem_librivox/challenge_streets_bk_64kb.mp3", "duration": 84}, {"section": 3, "title": "Challenge - Read by CRC", "readers": [10319], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/challenge_1511_poem_librivox/challenge_streets_crc_64kb.mp3", "duration": 87}, {"section": 4, "title": "Challenge - Read by DL", "readers": [2911], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/challenge_1511_poem_librivox/challenge_streets_dl_64kb.mp3", "duration": 69}, {"section": 5, "title": "Challenge - Read by EL", "readers": [9872], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/challenge_1511_poem_librivox/challenge_streets_el_64kb.mp3", "duration": 71}, {"section": 6, "title": "Challenge - Read by GG", "readers": [8011], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/challenge_1511_poem_librivox/challenge_streets_gg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 88}, {"section": 7, "title": "Challenge - Read by H4C", "readers": [10428], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/challenge_1511_poem_librivox/challenge_streets_h4c_64kb.mp3", "duration": 56}, {"section": 8, "title": "Challenge - Read by IK", "readers": [7785], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/challenge_1511_poem_librivox/challenge_streets_ik_64kb.mp3", "duration": 79}, {"section": 9, "title": "Challenge - Read by JM", "readers": [9902], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/challenge_1511_poem_librivox/challenge_streets_jm_64kb.mp3", "duration": 65}, {"section": 10, "title": "Challenge - Read by LAH", "readers": [1212], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/challenge_1511_poem_librivox/challenge_streets_lah_64kb.mp3", "duration": 69}, {"section": 11, "title": "Challenge - Read by LB", "readers": [9573], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/challenge_1511_poem_librivox/challenge_streets_lb_64kb.mp3", "duration": 69}, {"section": 12, "title": "Challenge - Read by MAS", "readers": [3645], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/challenge_1511_poem_librivox/challenge_streets_mas_64kb.mp3", "duration": 71}, {"section": 13, "title": "Challenge - Read by MK", "readers": [8051], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/challenge_1511_poem_librivox/challenge_streets_mk_64kb.mp3", "duration": 81}, {"section": 14, "title": "Challenge - Read by RG", "readers": [2607], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/challenge_1511_poem_librivox/challenge_streets_rg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 81}, {"section": 15, "title": "Challenge - Read by SJB", "readers": [10417], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/challenge_1511_poem_librivox/challenge_streets_sjb_64kb.mp3", "duration": 63}]}
