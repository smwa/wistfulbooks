{"title": "Short Nonfiction Collection, Vol. 096", "description": "\"Can we solve the problems confronting us? Well, the answer is an unequivocal and emphatic yes.\" This quote, from U.S. President Ronald Reagan's first inaugural address, captures the searching tone of many reader-chosen selections in vol. 096: The Peace Movement; Fortifications for Peace; An Effective Diplomatic Service; Annual Report of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs; Bigamy Act; Trade in the Dead; Traffic in Women; Inaugural addresses of Presidents Carter and Reagan; and an essay \"Have You an Educated Heart? Other readings highlight the arts: Parchment bindings; the Chinese Book; Folklore of Southern India; The Rosetta Stone; The WPA Art Collection; Jackie Coogan and the Kid; the Cradle of the Movies; and View of a City Sky Line. Rounding out the collection is a humorous piece, The Fatal Legs.<br><br>\r\nNote: The missing part of \"The Rosetta Stone (Except)\" concerns the deciphering of hieroglyphs, which is difficult to convey in audio.
