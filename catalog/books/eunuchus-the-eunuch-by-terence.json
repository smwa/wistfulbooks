{"title": "Eunuchus: The Eunuch", "description": "Another of the plays by Terence translated from the Latin by Riley. \"A certain citizen of Athens had a daughter named Pamphila, and a son called Chremes. The former was stolen while an infant, and sold to a Rhodian merchant, who having made a present of her to a Courtesan of Rhodes, she brought her up with her own daughter Thais, who was somewhat older.\" (From Translator summary) <br />\n\n<br> Hmmm, so kidnapping and slavery to start off; then there will be eunuchs and rape before the play ends. And it is a comedy?! Ah, well, it was 200BC. Times and opinions (thank goodness) have changed at least a bit since then.\n - Summary by ToddHW\n<BR><BR>Cast list:<BR>\nLaches, an aged Athenian: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/10801\">Jim Locke</a><br>\nPh\u00e6dria, his son: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/12874\">Aaron White</a><br>\nCh\u00e6rea, his son: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/10789\">Tomas Peter</a><br>\nAntipho, a young man, friend of Ch\u00e6rea: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/13072\">Campbell Schelp</a><br>\nChremes, a young man, brother of Pamphila: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/10957\">Owen Cook</a><br>\nThraso, a boastful Captain: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/7170\">alanmapstone</a><br>\nGnatho, a Parasite: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/6754\">ToddHW</a><br>\nParmeno, servant of Ph\u00e6dria: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/8677\">KHand</a><br>\nSanga, cook to Thraso: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/10087\">Sandra Schmit</a><br>\nDorus, a Eunuch slave: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/13177\">Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Surget</a><br>\nThais, a Courtesan: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/12500\">Foon</a><br>\nPythias, her attendant: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/10179\">Sonia</a><br>\nDorias, her attendant: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/10614\">Leanne Yau</a><br>\nSophrona, a nurse: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/10614\">Leanne Yau</a><br>\nStage Directions: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/8425\">Larry Wilson</a><br>\nEdited By: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/6754\">ToddHW</a>", "duration": 7058, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "13938", "name": " Terence"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/librivoxcdcoverart36/Eunuchus_1912.jpg", "copyright_year": "1896", "genres": ["Classics (Greek & Latin Antiquity)", "Plays"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "ToddHW"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "ToddHW"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Sonia"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Act 1", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/eunuchus_1912_librivox/eunuchus_1_terence_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1189}, {"section": 2, "title": "Act 2", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/eunuchus_1912_librivox/eunuchus_2_terence_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1228}, {"section": 3, "title": "Act 3", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/eunuchus_1912_librivox/eunuchus_3_terence_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1374}, {"section": 4, "title": "Act 4", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/eunuchus_1912_librivox/eunuchus_4_terence_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1462}, {"section": 5, "title": "Act 5", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/eunuchus_1912_librivox/eunuchus_5_terence_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1805}]}
