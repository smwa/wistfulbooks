{"title": "Master Humphrey's Clock", "description": "Between April of 1840 and December of the following year, Charles Dickens published Master Humphrey's Clock - a weekly periodical that presented short stories ostensibly read by the title character and his circle of friends - as well as correspondence to the fictional club.  Ultimately, the periodical included the complete novels \"The Old Curiosity Club\" and \"Barnaby Rudge.\"  These two novels are, however, referenced in the recording, when Master Humphrey and his friends refer to them.  This recording presents all the published material except for the two novels. - Summary by Brad \"Hamlet\" Filippone", "duration": 17410, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "91", "name": "Charles Dickens"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/master_humphreys_clock_bf_1705_librivox/master_humphreys_clock_1705.jpg", "copyright_year": "1841", "genres": ["General Fiction"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Hamlet"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Hamlet"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Ann Boulais"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "fiddlesticks"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Dedication and Prefaces", "readers": [9905], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/master_humphreys_clock_bf_1705_librivox/masterhumphreysclock_00_dickens_64kb.mp3", "duration": 565}, {"section": 1, "title": "Chapter One, part one - Master Humphrey From His Clock-Side / Introduction to the Giant Chronicles", "readers": [9905], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/master_humphreys_clock_bf_1705_librivox/masterhumphreysclock_01_dickens_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2066}, {"section": 2, "title": "Chapter One, part two - First Night of the Giant Chronicles / Correspondence to Master Humphrey", "readers": [9905], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/master_humphreys_clock_bf_1705_librivox/masterhumphreysclock_02_dickens_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2029}, {"section": 3, "title": "Chapter Two - Master Humphrey, From His Clock-Side, in the Chimney Corner / The Clock-Case / Correspondence", "readers": [9905], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/master_humphreys_clock_bf_1705_librivox/masterhumphreysclock_03_dickens_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2717}, {"section": 4, "title": "Chapter Three, part one - Master Humphrey's Visitor / Mister Pickwick's Tale", "readers": [9905], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/master_humphreys_clock_bf_1705_librivox/masterhumphreysclock_04_dickens_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2093}, {"section": 5, "title": "Chapter Three, part two - Second Part of Mister Pickwick's Tale / Further Particulars of Master Humprey's Visitor", "readers": [9905], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/master_humphreys_clock_bf_1705_librivox/masterhumphreysclock_05_dickens_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2111}, {"section": 6, "title": "Chapter Four - The Clock", "readers": [9905], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/master_humphreys_clock_bf_1705_librivox/masterhumphreysclock_06_dickens_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1194}, {"section": 7, "title": "Chapter Five - Mr. Weller's Watch", "readers": [9905], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/master_humphreys_clock_bf_1705_librivox/masterhumphreysclock_07_dickens_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1243}, {"section": 8, "title": "Chapter Six, part one - Master Humphrey, From His Clockside in the Chimney Corner", "readers": [9905], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/master_humphreys_clock_bf_1705_librivox/masterhumphreysclock_08_dickens_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1722}, {"section": 9, "title": "Chapter Six, part two - Master Humphrey, From His Clockside, continued / The Deaf Gentleman From His Own Apartment", "readers": [9905], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/master_humphreys_clock_bf_1705_librivox/masterhumphreysclock_09_dickens_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1315}, {"section": 10, "title": "Epilogue from Charles Dickens - To the Readers of Master Humphrey's Clock / Postscript", "readers": [9905], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/master_humphreys_clock_bf_1705_librivox/masterhumphreysclock_10_dickens_64kb.mp3", "duration": 355}]}
