{"title": "Ormond", "description": "Maria Edgeworth was one of the most popular writers of her time, a sharp and witty observer of society manners, and a favorite author for Jane Austen.\n<br><br>\n\u201cOrmond,\u201d published in 1817, is a \u201ccoming-of-age\u201d novel, tracing a young man\u2019s development as he approaches the age of majority. When we meet him, Harry Ormond has his \u201cheart in the right place,\u201d but is unsettled of character, na\u00efve and impulsive. The central issue is: \u201cWhat kind of man will he become?\u201d \n<br><br>\nIn part, Harry is influenced by the books he reads: Fielding\u2019s \u201cTom Jones,\u201d Richardson\u2019s \u201cSir Charles Grandison,\u201d and works of the French Enlightenment. More important, however, are influences from the company he keeps, much as Prince Hal in Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cHenry IV\u201d takes shape as a reflection of the people around him. As an orphan, Harry had been adopted by Sir Ulick O\u2019Shane, a man of society, full of subtlety and strategies, who exploits his public trust for private advantage (a practice known at that time as \u201cjobbing\u201d). Harry also spends time with Sir Ulick\u2019s cousin Cornelius, a Falstaffian figure of hearty good cheer and eccentric rural lifestyle. (He enthrones himself on a tiny island in an Irish lake, calls himself the \u201cKing of the Black Islands\u201d and nicknames Ormond \u201cPrince Harry.\u201d) Later, Harry follows Cornelius\u2019s daughter to Paris, where he witnesses the glamorous dissipation of French society in the years before the Revolution.\n<br><br>\nThis novel explores the challenges of bringing together apparent oppositions: reconciling promised loyalty with assertion of self, Anglo-Irish landlords with their Irish tenants, Catholics with Protestants, and the impulsive heart with the rational head.\n<br><br>\n\u201cOrmond\u201d is named in the reference list \u201c1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die.\u201d - Summary by Bruce Pirie", "duration": 49416, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "2083", "name": "Maria Edgeworth"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/ormond_2006_librivox/ormond_2006.jpg", "copyright_year": "1817", "genres": ["Literary Fiction", "Published 1800 -1900"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Bruce Pirie"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Bruce Pirie"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "J.
