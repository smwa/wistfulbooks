{"title": "Alarm Clocks", "description": "Joyce Kilmer (born as Alfred Joyce Kilmer)  was an American writer and poet mainly remembered for a short poem titled \"Trees\" (1913), which was published in the collection Trees and Other Poems in 1914. While most of his works are largely unknown, a select few of his poems remain popular and are published frequently in anthologies.<br /><br />\nAt the time of his deployment to Europe during World War I, Kilmer was considered the leading American Roman Catholic poet and lecturer of his generation, whom critics often compared to British contemporaries G. K. Chesterton (1874\u20131936) and Hilaire Belloc (1870\u20131953). He enlisted in the New York National Guard and was deployed to France with the 69th Infantry Regiment (the famous \"Fighting 69th\") in 1917. He was killed by a sniper's bullet at the Second Battle of the Marne in 1918 at the age of 31.  - Summary by Wikipedia", "duration": 1387, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "1341", "name": "Joyce Kilmer"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/alarm_clocks_1506.poem_librivox/alarm_clocks_1506.jpg", "copyright_year": "0", "genres": ["Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Alarm Clocks - Read by ALP", "readers": [4705], "path": "https://archive.org/download/alarm_clocks_1506.poem_librivox/alarmclocks_kilmer_alp_64kb.mp3", "duration": 69}, {"section": 2, "title": "Alarm Clocks - Read by  BGL", "readers": [10110], "path": "https://archive.org/download/alarm_clocks_1506.poem_librivox/alarmclocks_kilmer_bgl_64kb.mp3", "duration": 80}, {"section": 3, "title": "Alarm Clocks - Read by  BK", "readers": [8786], "path": "https://archive.org/download/alarm_clocks_1506.poem_librivox/alarmclocks_kilmer_bk_64kb.mp3", "duration": 78}, {"section": 4, "title": "Alarm Clocks - Read by CB", "readers": [9862], "path": "https://archive.org/download/alarm_clocks_1506.poem_librivox/alarmclocks_kilmer_cb_64kb.mp3", "duration": 64}, {"section": 5, "title": "Alarm Clocks - Read by  CLP", "readers": [9642], "path": "https://archive.org/download/alarm_clocks_1506.poem_librivox/alarmclocks_kilmer_clp_64kb.mp3", "duration": 55}, {"section": 6, "title": "Alarm Clocks - Read by  CR", "readers": [10101], "path": "https://archive.org/download/alarm_clocks_1506.poem_librivox/alarmclocks_kilmer_cr_64kb.mp3", "duration": 68}, {"section": 7, "title": "Alarm Clocks - Read by DCC", "readers": [10038], "path": "https://archive.org/download/alarm_clocks_1506.poem_librivox/alarmclocks_kilmer_dcc_64kb.mp3", "duration": 68}, {"section": 8, "title": "Alarm Clocks - Read by  DL", "readers": [2911], "path": "https://archive.org/download/alarm_clocks_1506.poem_librivox/alarmclocks_kilmer_dl_64kb.mp3", "duration": 71}, {"section": 9, "title": "Alarm Clocks - Read by EL", "readers": [9872], "path": "https://archive.org/download/alarm_clocks_1506.poem_librivox/alarmclocks_kilmer_el_64kb.mp3", "duration": 67}, {"section": 10, "title": "Alarm Clocks - Read by EZWA", "readers": [123], "path": "https://archive.org/download/alarm_clocks_1506.poem_librivox/alarmclocks_kilmer_ezwa_64kb.mp3", "duration": 81}, {"section": 11, "title": "Alarm Clocks - Read by  FS", "readers": [6735], "path": "https://archive.org/download/alarm_clocks_1506.poem_librivox/alarmclocks_kilmer_fs_64kb.mp3", "duration": 66}, {"section": 12, "title": "Alarm Clocks - Read by  GB", "readers": [4969], "path": "https://archive.org/download/alarm_clocks_1506.poem_librivox/alarmclocks_kilmer_gb_64kb.mp3", "duration": 72}, {"section": 13, "title": "Alarm Clocks - Read by  JH", "readers": [10111], "path": "https://archive.org/download/alarm_clocks_1506.poem_librivox/alarmclocks_kilmer_jh_64kb.mp3", "duration": 63}, {"section": 14, "title": "Alarm Clocks - Read by  JM", "readers": [9902], "path": "https://archive.org/download/alarm_clocks_1506.poem_librivox/alarmclocks_kilmer_jm_64kb.mp3", "duration": 67}, {"section": 15, "title": "Alarm Clocks - Read by  LAH", "readers": [1212], "path": "https://archive.org/download/alarm_clocks_1506.poem_librivox/alarmclocks_kilmer_lah_64kb.mp3", "duration": 66}, {"section": 16, "title": "Alarm Clocks - Read by  LCW", "readers": [8425], "path": "https://archive.org/download/alarm_clocks_1506.poem_librivox/alarmclocks_kilmer_lcw_64kb.mp3", "duration": 69}, {"section": 17, "title": "Alarm Clocks - Read by  MK", "readers": [8051], "path": "https://archive.org/download/alarm_clocks_1506.poem_librivox/alarmclocks_kilmer_mk_64kb.mp3", "duration": 80}, {"section": 18, "title": "Alarm Clocks - Read by NB", "readers": [6965], "path": "https://archive.org/download/alarm_clocks_1506.poem_librivox/alarmclocks_kilmer_nb_64kb.mp3", "duration": 74}, {"section": 19, "title": "Alarm Clocks - Read by  NF", "readers": [10102], "path": "https://archive.org/download/alarm_clocks_1506.poem_librivox/alarmclocks_kilmer_nf_64kb.mp3", "duration": 68}, {"section": 20, "title": "Alarm Clocks - Read by  REN", "readers": [10017], "path": "https://archive.org/download/alarm_clocks_1506.poem_librivox/alarmclocks_kilmer_ren_64kb.mp3", "duration": 61}]}
