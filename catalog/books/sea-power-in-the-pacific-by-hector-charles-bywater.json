{"title": "Sea-Power in the Pacific", "description": "During the three decades preceding the Pacific War, the United States placed no small amount of effort in gaming out what a such a conflict against Japan might look like. Ultimately, the Pacific War looked very little like the crystallization of these efforts expressed in War Plan Orange.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe Americans and the Japanese were both heavily influenced by the theories of sea power and decisive battle of Alfred Thayer Mahan, despite the lacklustre absence of any such climactic decision at sea in the Great War. \r\n<br><br>\r\nThe Pacific War would bear even less resemblance to Naval War College preconceptions as battleships were sidelined by the carrier\u2014initially out of necessity, though as planes improved, and the doctrine for their employment were clarified, the superior capability they provided to shape the battlespace would soon become as clear as daylight.\r\n<br><br>\r\n<i>Sea-Power in the Pacific</i>, published in 1921, is military writer Hector Charles Bywater\u2019s prediction which in some respects \u2013 together with his 1925 novel, <i>The Great Pacific War</i> \u2013 hits far closer to the mark than any actual naval war planning of the interwar period. \r\n<br><br>\r\nThe impact of these two books in the United States is questionable, but \u2013 according to a 1970 article by journalist William H. Honan from American Heritage \u2013 both books were translated into Japanese and circulated among naval officers during the interwar period.\r\n<br><br>\r\nPictured on the cover is Yamashita Gentar\u014d who was chief of the Navy General Staff at the time of this book\u2019s publication. He was a member of the Fleet Faction opposed to the Washington Naval Treaty which was the hot coal of contention in the fight for supremacy between the Naval General Staff and the Navy Ministry. It was also the Navy General Staff which very quickly organised and circulated a translation of <i>Sea-Power in the Pacific</i> upon its publication.\r\n<br><br>\r\nTo what extent this book influenced Japanese military thinking is uncertain, but it clearly did exert an influence on the critical political struggles at play within the Imperial Navy in the 1920s.\r\n -
