{"title": "Home Education: a Course of Lectures to Ladies", "description": "In proposing these lectures, my original notion was to popularize and amplify the valuable educational hints contained in some two or three chapters of Dr. Carpenter's \"Mental Physiology;\" but the subject is a wide one, and I have found it necessary to cover much ground untouched in that work. A complete or worthy treatment of \"Home Education\" within the limits of a single small volume is out of the question. My attempt is, to suggest a method of education resting upon a basis of natural law: and to touch, in this connection, upon the mother's duties to her children in the three stages of life during which they fall under her personal training, childhood, school-life, and young maidenhood. -
