{"title": "Sixteenth-century Bristol", "description": "Plague, piracy and payments to members of Parliament! The town of Bristol, England in the Sixteenth Century was a fascinating place, and John Latimer's book is a comprehensive guide to this period, describing royal visits from both Henry VIII and Elizabeth I, as well as detailing contemporary pastimes such as wrestling competitions, bear-baiting and traveling players. He explains the sanitary arrangements, dreadful postal service and the difficulty of moving from the status of town to \"City\" among many other interesting topics.\nIt is made up of papers originally published in the Bristol Mercury in 1902-3 and is read by Bristolian, Elaine Webb.\nSummary by Cori Samuel and Elaine Webb", "duration": 15972, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "2529", "name": "John Latimer"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt19/Sixteenth-century_Bristol_1209.jpg", "copyright_year": "1908", "genres": ["*Non-fiction", "History"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Elaine Webb"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Elaine Webb"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Bart de Leeuw"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Little Tee"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "chapter 01", "readers": [6292], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/sixteenth-century_bristol_1111_librivox/sixteenthcenturybristol_01_latimer_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1287}, {"section": 2, "title": "chapter 02", "readers": [6292], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/sixteenth-century_bristol_1111_librivox/sixteenthcenturybristol_02_latimer_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1554}, {"section": 3, "title": "chapter 03", "readers": [6292], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/sixteenth-century_bristol_1111_librivox/sixteenthcenturybristol_03_latimer_64kb.mp3", "duration": 783}, {"section": 4, "title": "chapter 04", "readers": [6292], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/sixteenth-century_bristol_1111_librivox/sixteenthcenturybristol_04_latimer_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1505}, {"section": 5, "title": "chapter 05", "readers": [6292], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/sixteenth-century_bristol_1111_librivox/sixteenthcenturybristol_05_latimer_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1841}, {"section": 6, "title": "chapter 06", "readers": [6292], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/sixteenth-century_bristol_1111_librivox/sixteenthcenturybristol_06_latimer_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1598}, {"section": 7, "title": "chapter 07", "readers": [6292], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/sixteenth-century_bristol_1111_librivox/sixteenthcenturybristol_07_latimer_64kb.mp3", "duration": 791}, {"section": 8, "title": "chapter 08", "readers": [6292], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/sixteenth-century_bristol_1111_librivox/sixteenthcenturybristol_08_latimer_64kb.mp3", "duration": 725}, {"section": 9, "title": "chapter 09", "readers": [6292], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/sixteenth-century_bristol_1111_librivox/sixteenthcenturybristol_09_latimer_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1524}, {"section": 10, "title": "chapter 10", "readers": [6292], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/sixteenth-century_bristol_1111_librivox/sixteenthcenturybristol_10_latimer_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1530}, {"section": 11, "title": "chapter 11", "readers": [6292], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/sixteenth-century_bristol_1111_librivox/sixteenthcenturybristol_11_latimer_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1895}, {"section": 12, "title": "chapter 12", "readers": [6292], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/sixteenth-century_bristol_1111_librivox/sixteenthcenturybristol_12_latimer_64kb.mp3", "duration": 939}]}
