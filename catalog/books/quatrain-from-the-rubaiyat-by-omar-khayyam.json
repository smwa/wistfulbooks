{"title": "Quatrain from the Rubaiyat", "description": "LibriVox volunteers bring you 12 recordings of Quatrain from The Rub\u00e1iy\u00e1t of Omar Khayy\u00e1m. Translated by Henry George Keene. This was the Weekly Poetry project for June 26, 2011.<br><br>The popularity of the celebrated translation of the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam by Edward Fitzgerald has cast many other worthy translations into undeserved obscurity. Among the earlier translators was Henry George Keene (1781-1856) whose translation of one quatrain appeared in 'Fundgruben des Orients' in 1816.<br><br>Instead of the image of the wine and cup popularly associated with the Rubaiyat, the stanza translated by Keene refers to an image even more thoroughly explored in the poem : the potter and his clay. It may be said that while the wine represents the chemistry of Omar's universe, the clay represents the physics. In this context, wine can be seen, not merely as an intoxicant, but rather as the mysterious elixir which enables the clay figures to enjoy a brief experience of life before they crumble into dust.(Summary by Algy Pug.)", "duration": 602, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "1299", "name": "Omar Khayy\u00e1m"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt29/Quatrain_Rubaiyat_Omar_Khayyam_1302.jpg", "copyright_year": "1816", "genres": ["Poetry", "Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Algy Pug"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Quatrain from the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam - Read by ALG", "readers": [4744], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/quatrain_1107_librivox/quatrain_khayyam_keene_alg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 45}, {"section": 2, "title": "Quatrain from the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam - Read by BG", "readers": [6446], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/quatrain_1107_librivox/quatrain_khayyam_keene_bg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 53}, {"section": 3, "title": "Quatrain from the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam - Read by CB", "readers": [6173], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/quatrain_1107_librivox/quatrain_khayyam_keene_cb_64kb.mp3", "duration": 49}, {"section": 4, "title": "Quatrain from the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam - Read by DL", "readers": [2911], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/quatrain_1107_librivox/quatrain_khayyam_keene_dl_64kb.mp3", "duration": 47}, {"section": 5, "title": "Quatrain from the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam - Read by GB", "readers": [4969], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/quatrain_1107_librivox/quatrain_khayyam_keene_gb_64kb.mp3", "duration": 49}, {"section": 6, "title": "Quatrain from the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam - Read by GHS", "readers": [4705], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/quatrain_1107_librivox/quatrain_khayyam_keene_ghs_64kb.mp3", "duration": 52}, {"section": 7, "title": "Quatrain from the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam -  Read by JCM", "readers": [3470], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/quatrain_1107_librivox/quatrain_khayyam_keene_jcm_64kb.mp3", "duration": 47}, {"section": 8, "title": "Quatrain from the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam - Read by LLW", "readers": [4738], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/quatrain_1107_librivox/quatrain_khayyam_keene_llw_64kb.mp3", "duration": 54}, {"section": 9, "title": "", "readers": [3595], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/quatrain_1107_librivox/quatrain_khayyam_keene_mg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 60}, {"section": 10, "title": "Quatrain from the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam - Read by RN", "readers": [3465], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/quatrain_1107_librivox/quatrain_khayyam_keene_rn_64kb.mp3", "duration": 50}, {"section": 11, "title": "Quatrain from the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam - Read by TG", "readers": [3157], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/quatrain_1107_librivox/quatrain_khayyam_keene_tg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 45}, {"section": 12, "title": "Quatrain from the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam - Read by WT", "readers": [5694], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/quatrain_1107_librivox/quatrain_khayyam_keene_wt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 51}]}
