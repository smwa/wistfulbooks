{"title": "Eshcol", "description": "This little book was published in 1647, soon after Owen had formed a church on the principles of Independency at Coggeshall, in Essex. It is designed to exhibit scriptural rules on the subject of ecclesiastical fellowship and discipline; the first part containing seven rules, on the duties of members of a church to their pastor; and the second fifteen, on their duties to one another. It was prepared by our author after he had adopted Congregational views, but is of such a nature as to be applicable and useful under any form of ecclesiastical polity. Each rule is established by a body of evidence from Scripture, and is followed by a general explanation. - Summary by Prefatory Note", "duration": 5915, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "5000", "name": " John Owen"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/eshcol_2509_librivox/eshcol_2509.jpg", "copyright_year": "1852", "genres": ["Christianity - Other"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "InTheDesert"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "InTheDesert"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Devorah Allen"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Elijah Fisher"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "To the Reader", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/eshcol_2509_librivox/eshcol_01_owen_64kb.mp3", "duration": 265}, {"section": 2, "title": "Rules of walking in fellowship, with reference to the pastor or minister that watcheth for our souls.", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/eshcol_2509_librivox/eshcol_02_owen_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1245}, {"section": 3, "title": "Rules to be observed by those who walk in fellowship, and considered, to stir up their remembrance in things of mutual duty one towards another, which consisteth in.
