{"title": "Hosea: from The Holy Bible with Original Notes", "description": "Hosea, whose prophecy we now enter upon, exercised his sacred office for a great many years: he predicted the captivity of the ten Tribes long before it arrived, yet he probably lived to witness its near approach. He is supposed to have been of the kingdom of Israel, though his prophecies frequently relate to Judah also His style is remarkably concise, sententious, and unconnected, though some parts are peculiarly pathetic, animated, and sublime. His general scope was to convince his people of their exceeding sinfulness, and to warn them by the terror, and lead them by the goodness, of God to repentance. - Summary by Introduction", "duration": 12925, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "17025", "name": "Thomas Scott"}], "coverArt": null, "copyright_year": "1815", "genres": ["Christianity - Commentary"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "InTheDesert"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "InTheDesert"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "DaveC"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "mleigh"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Introduction", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/hosea_from_the_holy_bible_2207_librivox/hosea_00_scott_64kb.mp3", "duration": 324}, {"section": 1, "title": "Hosea Chapter 1", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/hosea_from_the_holy_bible_2207_librivox/hosea_01_scott_64kb.mp3", "duration": 932}, {"section": 2, "title": "Hosea Chapter 2", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/hosea_from_the_holy_bible_2207_librivox/hosea_02_scott_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1485}, {"section": 3, "title": "Hosea Chapter 3", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/hosea_from_the_holy_bible_2207_librivox/hosea_03_scott_64kb.mp3", "duration": 612}, {"section": 4, "title": "Hosea Chapter 4", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/hosea_from_the_holy_bible_2207_librivox/hosea_04_scott_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1198}, {"section": 5, "title": "Hosea Chapter 5", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/hosea_from_the_holy_bible_2207_librivox/hosea_05_scott_64kb.mp3", "duration": 741}, {"section": 6, "title": "Hosea Chapter 6", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/hosea_from_the_holy_bible_2207_librivox/hosea_06_scott_64kb.mp3", "duration": 893}, {"section": 7, "title": "Hosea Chapter 7", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/hosea_from_the_holy_bible_2207_librivox/hosea_07_scott_64kb.mp3", "duration": 905}, {"section": 8, "title": "Hosea Chapter 8", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/hosea_from_the_holy_bible_2207_librivox/hosea_08_scott_64kb.mp3", "duration": 671}, {"section": 9, "title": "Hosea Chapter 9", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/hosea_from_the_holy_bible_2207_librivox/hosea_09_scott_64kb.mp3", "duration": 991}, {"section": 10, "title": "Hosea Chapter 10", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/hosea_from_the_holy_bible_2207_librivox/hosea_10_scott_64kb.mp3", "duration": 926}, {"section": 11, "title": "Hosea Chapter 11", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/hosea_from_the_holy_bible_2207_librivox/hosea_11_scott_64kb.mp3", "duration": 733}, {"section": 12, "title": "Hosea Chapter 12", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/hosea_from_the_holy_bible_2207_librivox/hosea_12_scott_64kb.mp3", "duration": 852}, {"section": 13, "title": "Hosea Chapter 13", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/hosea_from_the_holy_bible_2207_librivox/hosea_13_scott_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1022}, {"section": 14, "title": "Hosea Chapter 14", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/hosea_from_the_holy_bible_2207_librivox/hosea_14_scott_64kb.mp3", "duration": 640}]}
