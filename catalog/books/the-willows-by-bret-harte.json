{"title": "Willows", "description": "The Willows is a parody on the verse of Edgar Allan Poe.<br/>\nFrancis Bret Harte  was an American author and poet, best remembered for his short fiction featuring miners, gamblers, and other romantic figures of the California Gold Rush. In a career spanning more than four decades, he wrote poetry, fiction, plays, lectures, book reviews, editorials, and magazine sketches in addition to fiction. As he moved from California to the eastern U.S. to Europe, he incorporated new subjects and characters into his stories, but his Gold Rush tales have been most often reprinted, adapted, and admired. - Summary by Wikipedia", "duration": 1623, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "40", "name": "Bret Harte"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/librivoxcCDCoverArt35/willows_1607.jpg", "copyright_year": "1902", "genres": ["Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "The Willows - Read by BK", "readers": [8786], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_willows_1607.poem_librivox/willows_harte_bk_64kb.mp3", "duration": 289}, {"section": 2, "title": "The Willows - Read by BSD", "readers": [10402], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_willows_1607.poem_librivox/willows_harte_bsd_64kb.mp3", "duration": 262}, {"section": 3, "title": "The Willows - Read by DL", "readers": [2911], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_willows_1607.poem_librivox/willows_harte_dl_64kb.mp3", "duration": 267}, {"section": 4, "title": "The Willows - Read by MK", "readers": [8051], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_willows_1607.poem_librivox/willows_harte_mk_64kb.mp3", "duration": 314}, {"section": 5, "title": "The Willows - Read by MSD", "readers": [10891], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_willows_1607.poem_librivox/willows_harte_msd_64kb.mp3", "duration": 256}, {"section": 6, "title": "The Willows - Read by TP", "readers": [10789], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_willows_1607.poem_librivox/willows_harte_tp_64kb.mp3", "duration": 235}]}
