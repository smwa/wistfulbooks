{"title": "Song of Hugh Glass", "description": "This poem tells a story that begins in 1823 - just after the Leavenworth campaign against the Arikara Indians - and follows an expedition of Major Andrew Henry during a series of arduous journeys over the Trans-Missouri region. <br /><br />\n\nThe poem focuses upon the relationship between two trappers - Hugh Glass and Jamie - who, after fighting and hunting together, consequently develop a close friendship. The poem revolves around the betrayal of Hugh by Jamie: who leaves Hugh alone \"as good as dead\" to die by the Missouri. But Hugh lives - and recovers against all odds, pushing on with murderous intent to track down the ex-friend who left him helpless and expiring. <br /><br />\n\nThe final canto describes the moving denouement: Hugh and Jamie both are forced to recognize their own weaknesses, and then come to terms with the implications of their individual realizations. <br />\n\n(Introduction by Godsend)", "duration": 8485, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "1356", "name": "John Neihardt"}], "coverArt": "https://www.archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt/song_hugh_glass_1003.jpg", "copyright_year": "1915", "genres": ["Narratives"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Nathan"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Nathan"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Bart de Leeuw"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Betty M."}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Graybeard and Goldhair", "readers": [3793], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/song_of_hugh_glass_librivox/songofhughglass_01_neihardt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1777}, {"section": 2, "title": "The Awakening", "readers": [3793], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/song_of_hugh_glass_librivox/songofhughglass_02_neihardt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 715}, {"section": 3, "title": "The Crawl", "readers": [3793], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/song_of_hugh_glass_librivox/songofhughglass_03_neihardt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3836}, {"section": 4, "title": "The Return of the Ghost", "readers": [3793], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/song_of_hugh_glass_librivox/songofhughglass_04_neihardt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 982}, {"section": 5, "title": "Jamie", "readers": [3793], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/song_of_hugh_glass_librivox/songofhughglass_05_neihardt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1175}]}
