{"title": "Selection of Divine Poems", "description": "John Donne was an English Jacobean preacher, sometime lawyer, later in life a Member of Parliament and Royal Chaplain. Marrying for love against the wishes of his influential father-in-law; Donne's career was cast into shadow: forcing him to support his wife, Anne, as best he might under a specter of unforgiving penury. <br /><br />Despite such hardships - perhaps because of them - Donne's writings demonstrate a mastery of poetry layered with metaphysical meaning and mystery: which continues to delight and challenge modern-day readers. Donne's \"divine poems\" - the focus of this collection - present profound theological insights using absorbing allegories and beautiful imagery.<br /><br />At the end of Donne's life - as his health deteriorated under illnesses of increasing severity - his poetry served him as: distraction, consolation, and even \"public confession\". With them, Donne cheerfully but soberly faces the limits of his own mortality: and contemplates the mysteries that lie beyond the grave.<br />(Introduction by Godsend)", "duration": 2913, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "742", "name": "John Donne"}], "coverArt": "https://www.archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt4/selection_divine_poems_1004.jpg", "copyright_year": "1650", "genres": ["Single author", "Christianity - Other"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Nathan"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Nathan"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Ezwa"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "TriciaG"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Corona, La (The Cycle of 'The Crown')", "readers": [3793], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/selectionofdivinepoems_gdsd_1004_librivox/divinepoemsselection_01_donne_64kb.mp3", "duration": 416}, {"section": 2, "title": "Holy Sonnets I to XIX (aka 'The Divine Meditations')", "readers": [3793], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/selectionofdivinepoems_gdsd_1004_librivox/divinepoemsselection_02_donne_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1077}, {"section": 3, "title": "Cross, The", "readers": [3793], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/selectionofdivinepoems_gdsd_1004_librivox/divinepoemsselection_03_donne_64kb.mp3", "duration": 254}, {"section": 4, "title": "4 - Resurrection, Imperfect (or incomplete)", "readers": [3793], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/selectionofdivinepoems_gdsd_1004_librivox/divinepoemsselection_04_donne_64kb.mp3", "duration": 112}, {"section": 5, "title": "Litany, The", "readers": [3793], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/selectionofdivinepoems_gdsd_1004_librivox/divinepoemsselection_05_donne_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1054}]}
