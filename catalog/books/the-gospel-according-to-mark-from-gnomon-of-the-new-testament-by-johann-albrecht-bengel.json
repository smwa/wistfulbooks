{"title": "Gospel According to Mark, from Gnomon of the New Testament", "description": "The Gnomon of the New Testament, by John Albert Bengel is the scholar's delight. He selected the title as modest and appropriate, intending it in the sense of a pointer or indicator, like the sundial; his aim being to point out or indicate the full force and meaning of the words and sentences of the New Testament. He endeavours to let the text itself cast its shadow on his page, believing with Luther that \"the science of theology is nothing else but grammar exercised on the words of the Holy Spirit\".<br>His principles of interpretation stated in his \"Essay on the Right Way of Handling Divine Subjects\", are such as will make the lover of God's word feel safe in his hands: 'Put nothing into the Scriptures, but draw everything from them, and suffer nothing to remain hidden, that is really in them.\" \"Though each inspired writer has his own manner and style, one and the same Spirit breathes through all, one grand idea pervades all.\" \"Every divine communication carries (like the diamond) its own light with it, thus showing whence it comes; no touchstone is required to discriminate it.\" \"The true commentator will fasten his primary attention on the letter (literal meaning), but never forget that the Spirit must equally accompany him; at the same time we must never devise a more spiritual meaning for Scripture passages than the Holy Spirit intended.\" \"The historical matters of Scripture, both narrative and prophecy, constitute as it were the bones of its system, whereas the spiritual matters are as its muscles, blood vessels, and nerves. As the bones are necessary to the human system, so Scripture must have its historical matters. The expositor who nullifies the historical ground work of Scripture for the sake of finding only spiritual truths everywhere, brings death on all correct interpretations. Those expositions are the safest which keep closest to the text.\" - Summary by Charles Spurgeon", "duration": 12966, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "18575", "name": " Johann Albrecht Bengel"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/thegospelaccordingtomark_2411_librivox/gospel_mark_2411.jpg", "copyright_year": "1858", "genres": ["Christianity - Commentary"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "InTheDesert"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "InTheDesert"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Barry Eads"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "mleigh"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Mark Chapter 1", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/thegospelaccordingtomark_2411_librivox/gnomonnt02_01_bengel_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1560}, {"section": 2, "title": "Mark Chapter 2", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/thegospelaccordingtomark_2411_librivox/gnomonnt02_02_bengel_64kb.mp3", "duration": 380}, {"section": 3, "title": "Mark Chapter 3", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/thegospelaccordingtomark_2411_librivox/gnomonnt02_03_bengel_64kb.mp3", "duration": 821}, {"section": 4, "title": "Mark Chapter 4", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/thegospelaccordingtomark_2411_librivox/gnomonnt02_04_bengel_64kb.mp3", "duration": 820}, {"section": 5, "title": "Mark Chapter 5", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/thegospelaccordingtomark_2411_librivox/gnomonnt02_05_bengel_64kb.mp3", "duration": 650}, {"section": 6, "title": "Mark Chapter 6", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/thegospelaccordingtomark_2411_librivox/gnomonnt02_06_bengel_64kb.mp3", "duration": 789}, {"section": 7, "title": "Mark Chapter 7", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/thegospelaccordingtomark_2411_librivox/gnomonnt02_07_bengel_64kb.mp3", "duration": 911}, {"section": 8, "title": "Mark Chapter 8", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/thegospelaccordingtomark_2411_librivox/gnomonnt02_08_bengel_64kb.mp3", "duration": 553}, {"section": 9, "title": "Mark Chapter 9", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/thegospelaccordingtomark_2411_librivox/gnomonnt02_09_bengel_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1516}, {"section": 10, "title": "Mark Chapter 10", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/thegospelaccordingtomark_2411_librivox/gnomonnt02_10_bengel_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1089}, {"section": 11, "title": "Mark Chapter 11", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/thegospelaccordingtomark_2411_librivox/gnomonnt02_11_bengel_64kb.mp3", "duration": 557}, {"section": 12, "title": "Mark Chapter 12", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/thegospelaccordingtomark_2411_librivox/gnomonnt02_12_bengel_64kb.mp3", "duration": 684}, {"section": 13, "title": "Mark Chapter 13", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/thegospelaccordingtomark_2411_librivox/gnomonnt02_13_bengel_64kb.mp3", "duration": 617}, {"section": 14, "title": "Mark Chapter 14", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/thegospelaccordingtomark_2411_librivox/gnomonnt02_14_bengel_64kb.mp3", "duration": 774}, {"section": 15, "title": "Mark Chapter 15", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/thegospelaccordingtomark_2411_librivox/gnomonnt02_15_bengel_64kb.mp3", "duration": 607}, {"section": 16, "title": "Mark Chapter 16", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/thegospelaccordingtomark_2411_librivox/gnomonnt02_16_bengel_64kb.mp3", "duration": 638}]}
