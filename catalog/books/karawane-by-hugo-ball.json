{"title": "Karawane", "description": "LibriVox volunteers bring you 17 recordings of Karawane by Hugo Ball. This was the Weekly Poetry project for December 5th, 2010.<br><br>Ball wrote his poem \"Karawane,\" which is a German poem consisting of nonsensical words. The meaning however resides in its meaninglessness, reflecting the chief principle behind Dadaism.<br><br>Dada or Dadaism is a cultural movement that began in Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland, during World War I and peaked from 1916 to 1922.[1] The movement primarily involved visual arts, literature\u2014poetry, art manifestoes, art theory\u2014theatre, and graphic design, and concentrated its anti-war politics through a rejection of the prevailing standards in art through anti-art cultural works. Its purpose was to ridicule what its participants considered to be the meaninglessness of the modern world. In addition to being anti-war, dada was also anti-bourgeois and anarchistic in nature.(summary from Wikipedia)", "duration": 1041, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "1549", "name": "Hugo Ball"}], "coverArt": "https://www.archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt16/karawane_1204.jpg", "copyright_year": "1916", "genres": ["Poetry", "Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Karawane - Read by AC", "readers": [2587], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/karawane_1012_librivox/karawane_ball_ac_64kb.mp3", "duration": 51}, {"section": 2, "title": "Karawane - Read by DL", "readers": [2911], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/karawane_1012_librivox/karawane_ball_dl_64kb.mp3", "duration": 61}, {"section": 3, "title": "Karawane - Read by DRB", "readers": [94], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/karawane_1012_librivox/karawane_ball_drb_64kb.mp3", "duration": 59}, {"section": 4, "title": "Karawane - Read by DW", "readers": [2602], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/karawane_1012_librivox/karawane_ball_dw_64kb.mp3", "duration": 65}, {"section": 5, "title": "Karawane - Read by ELLI", "readers": [3885], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/karawane_1012_librivox/karawane_ball_elli_64kb.mp3", "duration": 44}, {"section": 6, "title": "Karawane - Read by EZWA", "readers": [123], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/karawane_1012_librivox/karawane_ball_ezwa_64kb.mp3", "duration": 50}, {"section": 7, "title": "Karawane - Read by GHS", "readers": [4705], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/karawane_1012_librivox/karawane_ball_ghs_64kb.mp3", "duration": 47}, {"section": 8, "title": "Karawane - Read by HF", "readers": [5055], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/karawane_1012_librivox/karawane_ball_hf_64kb.mp3", "duration": 59}, {"section": 9, "title": "Karawane - Read by JCM", "readers": [3470], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/karawane_1012_librivox/karawane_ball_jcm_64kb.mp3", "duration": 53}, {"section": 10, "title": "Karawane - Read by LLW", "readers": [4738], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/karawane_1012_librivox/karawane_ball_llw_64kb.mp3", "duration": 61}, {"section": 11, "title": "Karawane - Read by MG", "readers": [3595], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/karawane_1012_librivox/karawane_ball_mg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 100}, {"section": 12, "title": "Karawane - Read by MGT", "readers": [5421], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/karawane_1012_librivox/karawane_ball_mgt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 54}, {"section": 13, "title": "Karawane - Read by NJB", "readers": [1618], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/karawane_1012_librivox/karawane_ball_njb_64kb.mp3", "duration": 74}, {"section": 14, "title": "Karawane - Read by RG", "readers": [2607], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/karawane_1012_librivox/karawane_ball_rg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 68}, {"section": 15, "title": "Karawane - Read by RJD", "readers": [4042], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/karawane_1012_librivox/karawane_ball_rjd_64kb.mp3", "duration": 81}, {"section": 16, "title": "Karawane - Read by SR", "readers": [1998], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/karawane_1012_librivox/karawane_ball_sr_64kb.mp3", "duration": 60}, {"section": 17, "title": "Karawane - Read by TG", "readers": [3157], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/karawane_1012_librivox/karawane_ball_tg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 54}]}
