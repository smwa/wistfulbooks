{"title": "Under the Guns : A woman's reminiscences of the Civil War", "description": "Preface:The stories and reminiscences in this book are true to life, every one of them. They are told just as they occurred, without any attempt at literary embellishment; and most of them can be substantiated by living witnesses. My purpose has been simply to bring out in connection with these great military events, with which they were so intimately connected, a few of the many incidents and heart histories that were crowded into my own life, from April 20, 1861, to Nov. 23, 1865. Camps and hospitals were established near my own home in Keokuk, Iowa, early in April, 1861. I began at once my ministrations to the sick in these newly established hospitals, and, during my daily visits, closed the eyes of the first Iowa soldier who died in the war. From that time on till the close of the war I was actively engaged all along the lines. - Summary by Celine Major", "duration": 19953, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "18765", "name": "Annie  Wittenmyer"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/undertheguns_2411_librivox/undertheguns_2411.jpg", "copyright_year": "1895", "genres": ["*Non-fiction", "Memoirs"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Celine Major"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Celine Major"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "DaveC"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Helen Z.
