{"title": "Divine Companion", "description": "James Allen was a British philosophical writer known for his inspirational books and poetry and as a pioneer of the self-help movement. <br /><br />\n\nIn the introduction Lily Allen writes: \"It cannot be said of this book that James Allen wrote it at any particular time or in any one year, for he was engaged in it over many years and those who have eyes to see and hearts to understand will find in its pages the spiritual history of his life. It was his own wish that The Divine Companion should be the last manuscript of his to be published. 'It is the story of my soul,' he said, 'and should be read last of all my books, so that the student may understand and find my message in its pages.'\" (Summary by Wikipedia and Lily Allen)", "duration": 8951, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "1323", "name": "James Allen"}], "coverArt": "https://www.archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt19/Divine_Companion_1209.jpg", "copyright_year": "1919", "genres": ["Philosophy", "Psychology", "Religion"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Algy Pug"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Amy Gramour"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Charlotte Duckett"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Part 1: The Divine Companion", "readers": [4705], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/divine_companion_0705_librivox/divinecompanion_1_allen_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2647}, {"section": 2, "title": "Part 2: The Divine Dialogue", "readers": [4705, 6446], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/divine_companion_0705_librivox/divinecompanion_2_allen_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2392}, {"section": 3, "title": "Part 3: The Divine Message - Section 1 - Prophecies", "readers": [4705], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/divine_companion_0705_librivox/divinecompanion_3_allen_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1495}, {"section": 4, "title": "Part 3: The Divine Message - Section 2 - Exhortations", "readers": [4705], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/divine_companion_0705_librivox/divinecompanion_4_allen_64kb.mp3", "duration": 771}, {"section": 5, "title": "Part 3: The Divine Message - Section 3 - Instructions", "readers": [4705], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/divine_companion_0705_librivox/divinecompanion_5_allen_64kb.mp3", "duration": 903}, {"section": 6, "title": "Part 3: The Divine Message - Section 4 - Discourse", "readers": [4705], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/divine_companion_0705_librivox/divinecompanion_6_allen_64kb.mp3", "duration": 743}]}
