{"title": "Purple Sapphire, and Other Posthumous Papers: Complete Edition", "description": "This collection features a creepy and mysterious array of weird fiction, compiled under the fictional guise of being collegiate papers deposited in the archives of the University of Cosmopoli, detailing strange events and cursed objects that is sure to both spook and confound in equal measure.  Included for the first time is the infamous story \"The Cheetah-Girl\", originally intended to be included as the final story in this collection (as the table of contents even specified) but was pulled from the final publication due to its controversial themes.  It was published separately as a stand-alone chapbook two years later in a very limited printing and has been very rare and hard to come by ever since.  Enjoy this horrific and twisted tale of biology gone wrong, a story that still manages to shock a century later! - Summary by Ben Tucker", "duration": 18751, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "18922", "name": "Christopher Blayre"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/purplesapphire_2502_librivox/purple_sapphire_2502.jpg", "copyright_year": "1921", "genres": ["Horror & Supernatural Fiction", "Science Fiction"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Ben Tucker"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Ben Tucker"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Barry Eads"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Winnifred Assmann"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Antescript", "readers": [16758], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/purplesapphire_2502_librivox/purplesapphire_00_blayre_64kb.mp3", "duration": 105}, {"section": 1, "title": "The Purple Sapphire", "readers": [16758], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/purplesapphire_2502_librivox/purplesapphire_01_blayre_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3258}, {"section": 2, "title": "Aallila", "readers": [16758], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/purplesapphire_2502_librivox/purplesapphire_02_blayre_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2467}, {"section": 3, "title": "Purpura Lapillus", "readers": [16758], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/purplesapphire_2502_librivox/purplesapphire_03_blayre_64kb.mp3", "duration": 813}, {"section": 4, "title": "The Thing That Smelt", "readers": [16758], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/purplesapphire_2502_librivox/purplesapphire_04_blayre_64kb.mp3", "duration": 884}, {"section": 5, "title": "The Blue Cockroach", "readers": [16758], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/purplesapphire_2502_librivox/purplesapphire_05_blayre_64kb.mp3", "duration": 865}, {"section": 6, "title": "The Demon", "readers": [16758], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/purplesapphire_2502_librivox/purplesapphire_06_blayre_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1238}, {"section": 7, "title": "The Book", "readers": [16758], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/purplesapphire_2502_librivox/purplesapphire_07_blayre_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1403}, {"section": 8, "title": "The Cosmic Dust", "readers": [16758], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/purplesapphire_2502_librivox/purplesapphire_08_blayre_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1326}, {"section": 9, "title": "The Cheetah-Girl Part 1", "readers": [16758], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/purplesapphire_2502_librivox/purplesapphire_09_blayre_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2457}, {"section": 10, "title": "The Cheetah-Girl Part 2", "readers": [16758], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/purplesapphire_2502_librivox/purplesapphire_10_blayre_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3935}]}
