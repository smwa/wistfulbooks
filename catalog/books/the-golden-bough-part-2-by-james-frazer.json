{"title": "Golden Bough. A Study in Magic and Religion. Part 2. Taboo and the Perils of the Soul", "description": "The third volume of The Golden Bough. The term Taboo is one of the very few words which the English language has borrowed from the speech of savages. This volume examines the underlying moral code of many societies, both primitive and medieval, and with modern analogies. The reader is encouraged to contemplate the contradictions, inconsistencies, and absurdities, not merely between different people of different countries and ages, but also between similar people within the same countries. Frazer presents extensive evidence that the laws of morality slowly, but subtly, are in an ever changing state. - Summary by Leon Harvey", "duration": 51464, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "4405", "name": " James Frazer"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/goldenbough2_2109_librivox/goldenbough4_tabooandtheperilsofthesoul_2109.jpg", "copyright_year": "1911", "genres": ["Religion", "Social Science (Culture & Anthropology)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Leon Harvey"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Leon Harvey"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "TriciaG"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "HandmadePSK"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "PREFACE", "readers": [10851], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/goldenbough2_2109_librivox/goldenbough3_00_frazer_64kb.mp3", "duration": 464}, {"section": 1, "title": "I - THE BURDEN OF ROYALTY - 1.
