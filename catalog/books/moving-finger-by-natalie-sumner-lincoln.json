{"title": "Moving Finger", "description": "Bruce Brainerd becomes ill at the country house of his fiancee, Millicent Porter. He is put under the care of a trained nurse, Vera Deane, the night nurse of Craig Porter, who is a paralytic from the effects of an airplane encounter in France. The next morning Bruce Brainerd is found with his throat cut. Who commited the crime? As the plot unfolds, a possible motive is revealed for Nurse Deane to have killed him, and she was in the next room. Then we see that Hugh Wyndham, in love with Dorthy Deane, might be the criminal. The police are convinced that Alan Noyes, who disappeared the morning of the murder, is the guility man. One after another are various persons under a cloud, but the real murderer is not revealed until 'the moving finger' tells the truth. - Summary by NY Times quoted in Book Review Digest, 1919", "duration": 24382, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "2856", "name": "Natalie Sumner Lincoln"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/moving_finger_2309_librivox/moving_finger_2309.jpg", "copyright_year": "1918", "genres": ["Detective Fiction"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "James R.
