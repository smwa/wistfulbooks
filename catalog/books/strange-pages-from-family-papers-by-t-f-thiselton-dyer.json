{"title": "Strange Pages from Family Papers", "description": "\u201cAmong other qualities which have been supposed to belong to a dead man\u2019s hand, are its medicinal virtues, in connection with which may be mentioned the famous \u2018dead hand,\u2019 which was, in years past, kept at Bryn Hall, Lancashire\u2026 Thus the case is related of a woman who, attacked with the smallpox, had this dead hand in bed with her every night for six weeks, and of a poor lad living near Manchester who was touched with it for the cure of scrofulous sores.\u201d <br /><br />Though not all chapters have such gruesome subjects as The Dead Hand, all are full of a curious mixture of superstition and local history that will delight and amuse the modern listener.
