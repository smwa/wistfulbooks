{"title": "Marriage Contract", "description": "Balzac\u2019s novel \u201cThe Marriage Contract\u201d (1835) is part of his \u201cScenes of Private Life,\u201d which is one section of \u201cThe Human Comedy,\u201d his great fiction series. A wealthy gentleman wishes to marry a beautiful heiress, whose mother is a Spanish Creole. (In this context, \u201cCreole\u201d refers to a person who is genetically European, but born in a New World colony.) As was common for wealthy families of that time, notaries are hired to negotiate a prenuptial agreement.\r\n\r\nThe details of 19th-century financial arrangements may well seem obscure for modern readers. What remains true throughout time, however, is Balzac\u2019s unsparing portrait of humanity, in all its romantic illusions and its naked avarice, its capacity for na\u00efve innocence and for scheming treachery. - Summary by Bruce Pirie", "duration": 22605, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "86", "name": "Honor\u00e9 de Balzac"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/themarriagecontract_2504_librivox/marriagecontract_2504.jpg", "copyright_year": "1895", "genres": ["Literary Fiction", "Published 1800 -1900"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Bruce Pirie"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Bruce Pirie"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "J.
