{"title": "Girl from Farris's", "description": "Ever want to pull yourself up by your bootstraps, only to have the whole world fight to keep you down? Ever been upstanding and righteous, only to have those around you take advantage of you? In the most unique of circumstances, watch a woman flee from a lavish world of slavery in a brothel, to live in the muck and mire of squalor. With the law chasing after her, The Girl from Farris' must find a way to merely survive. And in other parts of town, watch an upstanding citizen go from Riches to Rags as his fiance' and business partners slowly tear down the soul of the man. Watch as these two paths collide at different points in their lives. Will it be happily ever after, or a bitter end?\nSummary by Joe DeNoia\nShe gets a job and although she can barely afford to care for herself, she stays on the straight and narrow, but her past is bound to catch up to her.", "duration": 10772, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "698", "name": "Edgar Rice Burroughs"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/girl_farriss_1802_librivox/girl_fariss_1802.jpg", "copyright_year": "1916", "genres": ["Genre(s):"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Joseph DeNoia"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Joseph DeNoia"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Annise"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Helen Z.
