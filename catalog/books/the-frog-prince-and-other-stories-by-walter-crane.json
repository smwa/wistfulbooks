{"title": "Frog Prince and Other Stories (version 2)", "description": "These three stories,The Frog Prince, Princess Belle-Etoile and Alladin, beloved by generations of children, are here retold in a format and style close to their earliest beginnings. Many of the embellishments that have been added to them over the centuries and which we now automatically associate with them have been omitted and the stores are presented in a simplicity and clarity that is refreshing to hear. They are full of beautiful princesses, noble, brave and handsome princes, dangerous quests, evil plotters and magic birds. In all, the righteous win out in the end and the wicked are properly punished.
