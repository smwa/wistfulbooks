{"title": "Loot Of Cities", "description": "Published in 1917, this is a collection of a novella and seven short stories by one of the cleverest authors of the early twentieth century.  \u2018In Queen's Quorum (1951), a survey of crime fiction, Ellery Queen listed Bennett's The Loot of Cities among the 100 most important works in the genre. This collection of stories recounts the adventures of a millionaire who commits crimes to achieve his idealistic ends. Although it was \"one of his least known works,\" it was nevertheless \"of unusual interest, both as an example of Arnold Bennett's early work and as an early example of dilettante detectivism\".\u2019 - Summary by David Wales", "duration": 19892, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "263", "name": "Arnold Bennett"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/librivoxcdcoverart36/lootcities_1912.jpg", "copyright_year": "1917", "genres": ["Detective Fiction", "Single Author Collections"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "David Wales"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "David Wales"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "DaveC"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "DaveC"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "The Loot Of Cities:  Chapter 1 The Fire Of London", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/loot_of_cities_1912_librivox/lootcities_01_bennett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2087}, {"section": 2, "title": "The Loot Of Cities:  Chapter 2 A Comedy On The Gold Coast", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/loot_of_cities_1912_librivox/lootcities_02_bennett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2082}, {"section": 3, "title": "The Loot Of Cities:  Chapter 3 A Bracelet At Bruges", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/loot_of_cities_1912_librivox/lootcities_03_bennett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2005}, {"section": 4, "title": "The Loot Of Cities:  Chapter 4 A Solution Of The Algiers Mystery", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/loot_of_cities_1912_librivox/lootcities_04_bennett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2026}, {"section": 5, "title": "The Loot Of Cities:  Chapter 5 In The Capital Of The Sahara", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/loot_of_cities_1912_librivox/lootcities_05_bennett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2073}, {"section": 6, "title": "The Loot Of Cities:  Chapter 6 \u2018Lo! \u2018Twas A Gala Night!\u2019", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/loot_of_cities_1912_librivox/lootcities_06_bennett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1882}, {"section": 7, "title": "Mr. Penfound\u2019s Two Burglars.
