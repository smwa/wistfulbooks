{"title": "Spider", "description": "Arthur Vernon, member of the Athenian club and member of \u201csociety,\u201d has a secret. His father has died and left him destitute, so he has begun a private investigation agency under the name \u201cNemo.\u201d It would be disastrous if this were known among his associates at the club, and especially if his intended in-laws found out. But he is quite sure no one else knows, that is until his old college classmate, Constantine Maunders, visits him with a proposition he can\u2019t refuse. Maunders knows all, and he wants to be made a partner in the agency, providing \u201cNemo\u201d with black-mail worthy information on other people in society in return for a share of the financial rewards for their silence. Vernon is appalled, particularly as \u201cNemo\u201d is engaged in solving a high profile blackmail case. These are the beginning of Vernons conundrums as the clues unfold.  - Summary by Don W.
