{"title": "Physician In Spite of Himself", "description": "The Physician In Spite of Himself \u2026 is written in a most unbounded spirit of mirth, the matrimonial breezes wafting a certain amount of refreshing coolness throughout it all. The way in which Sganarelle is dubbed, or rather drubbed a doctor, is highly amusing; and the cure of the dumb girl, and the use which she makes of her recovered speech, contains a philosophical lesson which may be sometimes applied to the way in which nouveaux riches spread their newly acquired wealth. The learned and anatomical disquisitions between Sganarelle and Geronte are also very entertaining, as well as the growth of greed in the rustic physician. - Summary by The Translator\n<BR><BR>Cast list:<BR>\nGeronte, father to Lucinda: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/6754\">ToddHW</a><br>\nLeandre, Lucinda's lover: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/11279\">aravagarwal</a><br>\nSganarelle, husband to Martine: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/11064\">Jason in Panama</a><br>\nMonsieur Robert, Sganarelle's neighbor: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/2156\">Roger Melin</a><br>\nLucas, husband to Jacqueline: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/10789\">Tomas Peter</a><br>\nValere, Geronte's servant: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/7170\">alanmapstone</a><br>\nThibaut, peasant: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/8879\">Son of the Exiles</a><br>\nPerrin, his son: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/10957\">Owen Cook</a><br>\nLucinda, Geronte's daughter: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/10614\">Leanne Yau</a><br>\nMartine, Sganarelle's wife: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/11084\">Devorah Allen</a><br>\nJacqueline, nurse at Geronte's, and Lucas' wife: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/10179\">Sonia</a><br>\nStage Directions: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/10087\">Sandra Schmit</a><br>\nEditor: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/6754\">ToddHW</a>", "duration": 4309, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "6282", "name": " Moli\u00e8re"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/physicianinspiteofhimself_1710_librivox/doctor_1710.jpg", "copyright_year": "18", "genres": ["Plays", "Satire"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "ToddHW"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "ToddHW"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Sonia"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Act 1", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/physicianinspiteofhimself_1710_librivox/physicianinspite_1_moliere_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1579}, {"section": 2, "title": "Act 2", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/physicianinspiteofhimself_1710_librivox/physicianinspite_2_moliere_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1481}, {"section": 3, "title": "Act 3", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/physicianinspiteofhimself_1710_librivox/physicianinspite_3_moliere_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1249}]}
