{"title": "Mythology", "description": "Jane Ellen Harrison was an English classical scholar whose work had a particular focus on the earliest origins of Greek religion. Her Mythology is a popular rather than an academic book, and its subject is the psychological/cultural history and \u201cpurpose\u201d of the chief Olympian gods and certain other mythological creatures, both for the ancient Greeks themselves, and through history to the present day. It is a short, accessible, and engaging book in a similar style to Joseph Campbell\u2019s Hero with a Thousand Faces.
