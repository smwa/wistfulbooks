{"title": "Handbook of Home Rule: Being Articles on the Irish Question", "description": "The issue of Irish home rule was the dominant political question of British and Irish politics in the late 1800s to early 1900s. Published in 1887, this work contains articles in favour of the measure. (Irish home rule was finally approved in 1914 but implementation was suspended until after WWI.)<br>\n\n\"The object of the writers has been to treat the difficult questions connected with the Government of Ireland in a dispassionate spirit; and the volume is offered to the public in the hope that it may, at a time of warm controversy over passing events, help to lead thoughtful men back to the consideration of the principles which underlie those questions, and which it seeks to elucidate by calm discussion and by references to history.\" (Summary by TriciaG & from Editor's Note)", "duration": 40380, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "3487", "name": "James Bryce"}, {"id": "7184", "name": "William Ewart Gladstone"}, {"id": "12176", "name": "Edwin Lawrence Godkin"}, {"id": "13567", "name": "Malcolm MacColl"}, {"id": "9637", "name": "John Morley"}, {"id": "13568", "name": "Richard Barry O'Brien"}, {"id": "13566", "name": "Henry Thring"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/handbook_of_home_rule_1905_librivox/handbook_home_rule_1905.jpg", "copyright_year": "1887", "genres": ["Political Science", "Early Modern", "Modern (19th C)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "TriciaG"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "TriciaG"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "TriciaG"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Preface by Earl Spencer, K.G.", "readers": [13077], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/handbook_of_home_rule_1905_librivox/handbookofhomerule_01_various_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1451}, {"section": 2, "title": "American Home Rule by E.
