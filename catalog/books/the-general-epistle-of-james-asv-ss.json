{"title": "Bible (ASV) NT 20: James", "description": "The Epistle of James is a book in the Christian New Testament. The author identifies himself as James (James 1:1), traditionally understood as James the Just, the brother of Jesus, first of the Seventy Disciples and first Bishop of Jerusalem. With no overriding theme, the text condemns various sins and calls on Christians to be patient while awaiting the imminent Second Coming. The epistle has caused controversy: Protestant reformer Martin Luther argued that it was not the work of an apostle. Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy and Mormonism claim it contradicts Luther's doctrine of justification through faith alone (Sola fide) derived from his translation of Romans 3:28. The Christian debate over Justification is still unsettled, see also Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification and Christian view of the Law.</p> <br>(Summary from Wikipedia)", "duration": 1021, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "187", "name": " American Standard Version"}], "coverArt": "http://www.archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt12/James_ASV_1109.jpg", "copyright_year": "1901", "genres": ["American Standard Version"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Sam Stinson"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Sam Stinson"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Ezwa"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Chapter 1", "readers": [908], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/the_general_epistle_of_james_ss_librivox/james_01_asv_64kb.mp3", "duration": 232}, {"section": 2, "title": "Chapter 2", "readers": [908], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/the_general_epistle_of_james_ss_librivox/james_02_asv_64kb.mp3", "duration": 228}, {"section": 3, "title": "Chapter 3", "readers": [908], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/the_general_epistle_of_james_ss_librivox/james_03_asv_64kb.mp3", "duration": 178}, {"section": 4, "title": "Chapter 4", "readers": [908], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/the_general_epistle_of_james_ss_librivox/james_04_asv_64kb.mp3", "duration": 172}, {"section": 5, "title": "Chapter 5", "readers": [908], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/the_general_epistle_of_james_ss_librivox/james_05_asv_64kb.mp3", "duration": 211}]}
