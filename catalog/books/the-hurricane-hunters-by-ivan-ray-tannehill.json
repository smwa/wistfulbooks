{"title": "Hurricane Hunters", "description": "This 1955 book by an acknowledged authority is an absorbing account of meteorology before the advent of weather satellites.  \u201cThis is the lively account of the hair-raising experiences of the men who have probed by sea and air into the inner mysteries of the world\u2019s most terrible storms\u2026.  Here is the first intimate revelation of what the human eye and the most modern radars see in the violent regions of the tropical vortex. The descriptions of the activities of these valiant scouts of the storms are taken from personal interviews with military flyers and weathermen who have risked their lives in the furious blasts in all parts of the hurricane.  The author has made a special study of hurricanes for over forty years. He has served with the Weather Bureau as chief of the marine division, chief of all forecasting and reporting and assistant chief of the Bureau, in charge of its technical operations.\u201d - Summary by Advertisement in the book and David Wales", "duration": 33272, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "14160", "name": "Ivan Ray Tannehill"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/the_hurricane_hunters_1907_librivox/hurricanehunters_1907.jpg", "copyright_year": "1955", "genres": ["Nature", "Science", "Technology & Engineering"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "David Wales"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "David Wales"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "DaveC"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "DaveC"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Monsters Of The World Of Storms", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_hurricane_hunters_1907_librivox/hurricanehunters_01_tannehill_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2227}, {"section": 2, "title": "The Saddler's Apprentice", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_hurricane_hunters_1907_librivox/hurricanehunters_02_tannehill_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1579}, {"section": 3, "title": "At The Bottom Of The Sea", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_hurricane_hunters_1907_librivox/hurricanehunters_03_tannehill_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1548}, {"section": 4, "title": "Storm Warnings", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_hurricane_hunters_1907_librivox/hurricanehunters_04_tannehill_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1725}, {"section": 5, "title": "Radio Helps -- Then Hinders", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_hurricane_hunters_1907_librivox/hurricanehunters_05_tannehill_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1871}, {"section": 6, "title": "The Eye Of The Hurricane", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_hurricane_hunters_1907_librivox/hurricanehunters_06_tannehill_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1828}, {"section": 7, "title": "First Flight Into The Vortex", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_hurricane_hunters_1907_librivox/hurricanehunters_07_tannehill_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1557}, {"section": 8, "title": "The Hammer And The Highway", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_hurricane_hunters_1907_librivox/hurricanehunters_08_tannehill_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1723}, {"section": 9, "title": "Wings Against The Whirling Blasts", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_hurricane_hunters_1907_librivox/hurricanehunters_09_tannehill_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1902}, {"section": 10, "title": "Kappler's Hurricane", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_hurricane_hunters_1907_librivox/hurricanehunters_10_tannehill_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2193}, {"section": 11, "title": "Tricks Of The Trade", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_hurricane_hunters_1907_librivox/hurricanehunters_11_tannehill_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2182}, {"section": 12, "title": "Trailing The Terrible Typhoon", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_hurricane_hunters_1907_librivox/hurricanehunters_12_tannehill_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2240}, {"section": 13, "title": "Guest On A Hairy Hop", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_hurricane_hunters_1907_librivox/hurricanehunters_13_tannehill_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2003}, {"section": 14, "title": "The Unexpected", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_hurricane_hunters_1907_librivox/hurricanehunters_14_tannehill_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2774}, {"section": 15, "title": "Fighting Hail And Hurricanes", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_hurricane_hunters_1907_librivox/hurricanehunters_15_tannehill_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1519}, {"section": 16, "title": "Carol, Edna, Hazel Or Saxby!", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_hurricane_hunters_1907_librivox/hurricanehunters_16_tannehill_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1519}, {"section": 17, "title": "The Gears And Guts Of The Giant", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_hurricane_hunters_1907_librivox/hurricanehunters_17_tannehill_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2771}, {"section": 18, "title": "Biographical Sketch Of The Author", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_hurricane_hunters_1907_librivox/hurricanehunters_18_tannehill_64kb.mp3", "duration": 111}]}
