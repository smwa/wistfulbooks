{"title": "Religious Affections", "description": "Jonathan Edwards (1703-1758) was a pre-revolutionary American pastor and academic in Massachusetts, and is also widely considered to be both the last of the great Puritans, and a founder of modern evangelicalism. In 1732, his church and many churches in the surrounding region experienced \u201cThe Great Awakening\u201d, a massive religious revival. The Great Awakening saw many people having heightened \u201caffections\u201d, or emotions, in response to their increased spirituality \u2013 this included excessive weeping, joyous outbursts, and many other manifestations that concerned more conservative people around them. Edwards wrote Religious Affections in order to show that affections could be a legitimate part of Christian spirituality, but only when conjoined with sound theology and godly practice. The book now stands as a classic in the field of Christian spirituality.
