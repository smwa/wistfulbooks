{"title": "Christmas Bells (Version 2)", "description": "LibriVox volunteers bring you 17 recordings of Christmas Bells by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. <br>\r\nThis was the Fortnightly Poetry project for December 18, 2022.<br><br>\r\n\r\nHenry Wadsworth Longfellow (27 February 1807 - 24 March 1882) was an American poet and teacher best known for the poems \"Paul Revere's Ride\", \"The Song Of Hiawatha\" and \"Evangeline.\" He was one of the so-called fireside poets from New England. This poem was written on Christmas Day 1863 and deals with the stark contrast between the Christmas message of peace on earth and the brutal and devastating American Civil War which was at its height. The poem was published in February of 1865 and first set to music in 1872 by English organist John Baptiste Calkin. Calkin's tune is still the one commonly used with the text to this day under the name of \"I Heard The Bells On Christmas Day.\" - Summary by mungojerry311", "duration": 2065, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "43", "name": "Henry Wadsworth Longfellow"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/christmas_bells_v2_2301.poem_librivox/christmas_bells_2301.jpg", "genres": ["Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Mark Dykshoorn"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Mark Dykshoorn"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Christmas Bells - Read by BK", "readers": [8786], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/christmas_bells_v2_2301.poem_librivox/christmasbells_longfellow_bk_64kb.mp3", "duration": 115}, {"section": 2, "title": "Christmas Bells - Read by BM", "readers": [4570], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/christmas_bells_v2_2301.poem_librivox/christmasbells_longfellow_bm_64kb.mp3", "duration": 132}, {"section": 3, "title": "Christmas Bells - Read by CF", "readers": [11305], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/christmas_bells_v2_2301.poem_librivox/christmasbells_longfellow_cf_64kb.mp3", "duration": 112}, {"section": 4, "title": "Christmas Bells - Read by CZ", "readers": [15806], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/christmas_bells_v2_2301.poem_librivox/christmasbells_longfellow_cz_64kb.mp3", "duration": 113}, {"section": 5, "title": "Christmas Bells - Read by DL", "readers": [2911], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/christmas_bells_v2_2301.poem_librivox/christmasbells_longfellow_dl_64kb.mp3", "duration": 112}, {"section": 6, "title": "Christmas Bells - Read by FEN", "readers": [10634], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/christmas_bells_v2_2301.poem_librivox/christmasbells_longfellow_fen_64kb.mp3", "duration": 136}, {"section": 7, "title": "Christmas Bells - Read by GG", "readers": [8011], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/christmas_bells_v2_2301.poem_librivox/christmasbells_longfellow_gg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 137}, {"section": 8, "title": "Christmas Bells - Read by GLN", "readers": [4969], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/christmas_bells_v2_2301.poem_librivox/christmasbells_longfellow_gln_64kb.mp3", "duration": 122}, {"section": 9, "title": "Christmas Bells - Read by JA", "readers": [18119], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/christmas_bells_v2_2301.poem_librivox/christmasbells_longfellow_ja_64kb.mp3", "duration": 110}, {"section": 10, "title": "Christmas Bells - Read by JFJ", "readers": [17799], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/christmas_bells_v2_2301.poem_librivox/christmasbells_longfellow_jfj_64kb.mp3", "duration": 125}, {"section": 11, "title": "Christmas Bells - Read by LCW", "readers": [8425], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/christmas_bells_v2_2301.poem_librivox/christmasbells_longfellow_lcw_64kb.mp3", "duration": 107}, {"section": 12, "title": "Christmas Bells - Read by LS", "readers": [15365], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/christmas_bells_v2_2301.poem_librivox/christmasbells_longfellow_ls_64kb.mp3", "duration": 108}, {"section": 13, "title": "Christmas Bells - Read by PLM", "readers": [13243], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/christmas_bells_v2_2301.poem_librivox/christmasbells_longfellow_plm_64kb.mp3", "duration": 109}, {"section": 14, "title": "Christmas Bells - Read by PR", "readers": [17124], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/christmas_bells_v2_2301.poem_librivox/christmasbells_longfellow_pr_64kb.mp3", "duration": 126}, {"section": 15, "title": "Christmas Bells - Read by RR", "readers": [17752], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/christmas_bells_v2_2301.poem_librivox/christmasbells_longfellow_rr_64kb.mp3", "duration": 116}, {"section": 16, "title": "Christmas Bells - Sung by TG", "readers": [3157], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/christmas_bells_v2_2301.poem_librivox/christmasbells_longfellow_tg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 168}, {"section": 17, "title": "Christmas Bells - Read by WC", "readers": [12980], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/christmas_bells_v2_2301.poem_librivox/christmasbells_longfellow_wc_64kb.mp3", "duration": 117}]}
