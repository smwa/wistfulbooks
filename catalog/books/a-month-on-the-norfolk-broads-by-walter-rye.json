{"title": "Month on the Norfolk Broads", "description": "Back in the late 1880s, Walter Rye and a number of friends accompanied by an American couple (who were researching the history of their Norfolk ancestry), took a holiday on the Norfolk Broads and enjoyed a leisurely tour around the waterways of this unique part of Eastern England.This book documents some of the highlights of their trip on board the wherry Z\u00f6e and the hybrid wherry/cutter Lotus, as they sailed and explored many places of interest of the region. <br>\r\n\r\nAlthough born in London, Walter Rye's family came from Norfolk, a county that he moved back to early in his life. He had a lifelong interest in the Broads region and was an acknowledged expert antiquarian in all aspects of Norfolk history.<br>\r\n\r\nInterested but haven't got a whole month to spare? Well, why not jump aboard anyway and listen in for a few short hours as \"the poet, the athlete, the liar and the antiquary\", our American visitors and Mr Rye hoist their sails and head out to see what they can discover on their waterborne cruise. - Summary by TND", "duration": 15079, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "16232", "name": "Walter Rye"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/amonthonthenorfolkbroads_2109_librivox/norfolkbroads_2109.jpg", "copyright_year": "1887", "genres": ["Travel & Geography"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "TND"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "TND"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Colleen McMahon"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Colleen McMahon"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Preface", "readers": [9128], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/amonthonthenorfolkbroads_2109_librivox/amonthonnorfolkbroads_00_rye_64kb.mp3", "duration": 540}, {"section": 1, "title": "Chapter 1 - Just a-going to begin", "readers": [9128], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/amonthonthenorfolkbroads_2109_librivox/amonthonnorfolkbroads_01_rye_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1009}, {"section": 2, "title": "Chapter 2 - Beccles to Yarmouth", "readers": [9128], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/amonthonthenorfolkbroads_2109_librivox/amonthonnorfolkbroads_02_rye_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1905}, {"section": 3, "title": "Chapter 3 - Yarmouth", "readers": [9128], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/amonthonthenorfolkbroads_2109_librivox/amonthonnorfolkbroads_03_rye_64kb.mp3", "duration": 257}, {"section": 4, "title": "Chapter 4 - Yarmouth to Potter Heigham", "readers": [9128], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/amonthonthenorfolkbroads_2109_librivox/amonthonnorfolkbroads_04_rye_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1200}, {"section": 5, "title": "Chapter 5 - Potter Heigham, Up the Thurne, Back to St.Benet's", "readers": [9128], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/amonthonthenorfolkbroads_2109_librivox/amonthonnorfolkbroads_05_rye_64kb.mp3", "duration": 881}, {"section": 6, "title": "Chapter 6 - St. Benet's and up the Ant", "readers": [9128], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/amonthonthenorfolkbroads_2109_librivox/amonthonnorfolkbroads_06_rye_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1486}, {"section": 7, "title": "Chapter 7 - Barton Broad and Stalham Staithe", "readers": [9128], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/amonthonthenorfolkbroads_2109_librivox/amonthonnorfolkbroads_07_rye_64kb.mp3", "duration": 474}, {"section": 8, "title": "Chapter 8 - Up the Ant to Ebridge Mill", "readers": [9128], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/amonthonthenorfolkbroads_2109_librivox/amonthonnorfolkbroads_08_rye_64kb.mp3", "duration": 595}, {"section": 9, "title": "Chapter 9 - An Ancestor Hunt", "readers": [9128], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/amonthonthenorfolkbroads_2109_librivox/amonthonnorfolkbroads_09_rye_64kb.mp3", "duration": 917}, {"section": 10, "title": "Chapter 10 - Up to Wroxham", "readers": [9128], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/amonthonthenorfolkbroads_2109_librivox/amonthonnorfolkbroads_10_rye_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1581}, {"section": 11, "title": "Chapter 11 - Down the Norwich River to Yarmouth", "readers": [9128], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/amonthonthenorfolkbroads_2109_librivox/amonthonnorfolkbroads_11_rye_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1930}, {"section": 12, "title": "Norfolk & Suffolk Fisheries Act - Bye Laws", "readers": [9128], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/amonthonthenorfolkbroads_2109_librivox/amonthonnorfolkbroads_12_rye_64kb.mp3", "duration": 831}, {"section": 13, "title": "Everything for your holiday - from Provisions to Pianos (Adverts)", "readers": [9128], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/amonthonthenorfolkbroads_2109_librivox/amonthonnorfolkbroads_13_rye_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1473}]}
