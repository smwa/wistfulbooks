{"title": "Yet Again", "description": "This is a diverse collection of essays by English writer Max Beerbohm, whose circle included such famous men as Oscar Wilde, George Bernard Shaw, Ezra Pound, and Somerset Maugham.<br /><br />The essays vary considerably in character and subject. They include, among others: a spoof on the bumbling and inarticulate nature of oratory in the House of Commons; a discussion of the writings of James Whistler, the impressionist painter (which Beerbohm considers widely neglected and under-rated); a humorous consideration of why the King of England should make a royal visit to Switzerland; and a description of the delights of frequent attendance at British courts of justice.<br /><br />The author was among England's best known artists; Section Twenty-Two contains humorous (as well as critical) discussions of nine works of art, including paintings by Reubens, Corot, and Bellini. \n\n- Summary by Kirsten Wever", "duration": 29051, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "5069", "name": " Max Beerbohm"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/yetagain_1704_librivox/yetagain_1704.jpg", "copyright_year": "1909", "genres": ["Essays & Short Works"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Kirsten Wever"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Kirsten Wever"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "TriciaG"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "TriciaG"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "The Fire", "readers": [5789], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/yetagain_1704_librivox/yetagain_01_beerbohm_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1464}, {"section": 2, "title": "Seeing People Off", "readers": [5789], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/yetagain_1704_librivox/yetagain_02_beerbohm_64kb.mp3", "duration": 795}, {"section": 3, "title": "A Memory of a Midnight Express", "readers": [5789], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/yetagain_1704_librivox/yetagain_03_beerbohm_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1005}, {"section": 4, "title": "Porro Unum", "readers": [5789], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/yetagain_1704_librivox/yetagain_04_beerbohm_64kb.mp3", "duration": 751}, {"section": 5, "title": "A Club in Ruins", "readers": [5789], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/yetagain_1704_librivox/yetagain_05_beerbohm_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1342}, {"section": 6, "title": "'273'", "readers": [5789], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/yetagain_1704_librivox/yetagain_06_beerbohm_64kb.mp3", "duration": 803}, {"section": 7, "title": "A Study in Dejection", "readers": [5789], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/yetagain_1704_librivox/yetagain_07_beerbohm_64kb.mp3", "duration": 677}, {"section": 8, "title": "A Pathetic Imposture", "readers": [5789], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/yetagain_1704_librivox/yetagain_08_beerbohm_64kb.mp3", "duration": 616}, {"section": 9, "title": "The Decline of the Graces", "readers": [5789], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/yetagain_1704_librivox/yetagain_09_beerbohm_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1375}, {"section": 10, "title": "Whistler's Writing", "readers": [5789], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/yetagain_1704_librivox/yetagain_10_beerbohm_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1627}, {"section": 11, "title": "Ichabod", "readers": [5789], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/yetagain_1704_librivox/yetagain_11_beerbohm_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2594}, {"section": 12, "title": "General Elections", "readers": [5789], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/yetagain_1704_librivox/yetagain_12_beerbohm_64kb.mp3", "duration": 649}, {"section": 13, "title": "A Parallel", "readers": [5789], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/yetagain_1704_librivox/yetagain_13_beerbohm_64kb.mp3", "duration": 554}, {"section": 14, "title": "A Morris for May-Day", "readers": [5789], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/yetagain_1704_librivox/yetagain_14_beerbohm_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1721}, {"section": 15, "title": "The House of Commons Manner", "readers": [5789], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/yetagain_1704_librivox/yetagain_15_beerbohm_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1325}, {"section": 16, "title": "The Naming of Streets", "readers": [5789], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/yetagain_1704_librivox/yetagain_16_beerbohm_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1896}, {"section": 17, "title": "On Shakespeare's Birthday", "readers": [5789], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/yetagain_1704_librivox/yetagain_17_beerbohm_64kb.mp3", "duration": 748}, {"section": 18, "title": "A Home-Coming", "readers": [5789], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/yetagain_1704_librivox/yetagain_18_beerbohm_64kb.mp3", "duration": 623}, {"section": 19, "title": "'The Ragged Regiment'", "readers": [5789], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/yetagain_1704_librivox/yetagain_19_beerbohm_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1178}, {"section": 20, "title": "The Homour of the Public", "readers": [5789], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/yetagain_1704_librivox/yetagain_20_beerbohm_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1506}, {"section": 21, "title": "Dulcedo Judiciorum", "readers": [5789], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/yetagain_1704_librivox/yetagain_21_beerbohm_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1782}, {"section": 22, "title": "Words for Pictures", "readers": [5789], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/yetagain_1704_librivox/yetagain_22_beerbohm_64kb.mp3", "duration": 4020}]}
