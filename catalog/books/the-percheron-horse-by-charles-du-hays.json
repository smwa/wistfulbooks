{"title": "Percheron horse", "description": "The little volume which is now presented to the notice of the lovers of the horse in America is a translation of the work of a distinguished French author, who, holding a high position of trust, made this as a report to the Government. His views in some respects may be regarded as extreme, but on the whole they are characterized by strong common sense and are supported by a practical familiarity with all the phases of his subject which should give them weight.\r\n\r\nThe Percheron horse no doubt stands first among the draft breeds of the world. His value has been thoroughly tested in this country, and the fact is established beyond a cavil that with careful breeding, and probably an occasional renewal by the importation of fresh blood, the Percheron maintains his superior characteristics, and impresses them upon his descendants of only one-quarter or one-eighth blood to a very marked degree. The value of fast trotters, their encouragement by Agricultural Societies, and the enormous prices which have been paid for animals valuable simply for their speed as trotters, has no doubt had a tendency to direct the aims of horse breeders in a wrong direction. The result is, from whatever cause it comes, that the true horse-of-all-work has been neglected. The Percheron, combining as he does a certain attractiveness[Pg 6] of style, very free action, considerable speed united to power, with astonishing strength for his weight, and the greatest kindness and docility, seems to offer to American horse breeders an exceedingly useful animal, either to be maintained distinct, or used for improving our stock of both light and heavy draft-horses by crossings. The value of this work, however, does not consist in its recommendation of this breed, or demonstration of its value in France, but its bold discussions of the principles of breeding as applied to the improvement of the Percherons, and equally applicable to that of other draft breeds, will doubtless commend themselves to the careful consideration of breeders.\r\n\r\nInterest in the Percherons has increased greatly of late. Several notable importations have been made, and excellent representatives of this noble breed are to be found in the Eastern, Western, and Middle States. The engravings which embellish this volume are portraits of animals owned by Mr. W. T. Walters of Baltimore, Md., through whose interest in this subject the Publishers were induced to issue this translation of M. Hu\u00ffs work.", "duration": 10967, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "17979", "name": "Charles du Hays"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/percheronhorse_2407_librivox/percheronhorse_2407.jpg", "copyright_year": "1868", "genres": ["Animals"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Lynne T"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Lynne T"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Production, Rearing, and Improvement of the Percheron Horse", "readers": [18946], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/percheronhorse_2407_librivox/percheronhorse_01_duhays_64kb.mp3", "duration": 441}, {"section": 2, "title": "Part First: Glance at Perche", "readers": [7756], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/percheronhorse_2407_librivox/percheronhorse_02_duhays_64kb.mp3", "duration": 448}, {"section": 3, "title": "Sketch of the Percheron Race; Origin of the Percheron", "readers": [18946], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/percheronhorse_2407_librivox/percheronhorse_03_duhays_64kb.mp3", "duration": 590}, {"section": 4, "title": "Modifications of the Percheron Race; His first Modification due to contact with the Brittany Race", "readers": [18603], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/percheronhorse_2407_librivox/percheronhorse_04_duhays_64kb.mp3", "duration": 425}, {"section": 5, "title": "Conditions under which they are bred", "readers": [18946], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/percheronhorse_2407_librivox/percheronhorse_05_duhays_64kb.mp3", "duration": 388}, {"section": 6, "title": "Causes of the Degeneracy of the Percheron Horse; Starting Point of this Degeneration", "readers": [19122], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/percheronhorse_2407_librivox/percheronhorse_06_duhays_64kb.mp3", "duration": 223}, {"section": 7, "title": "Part Second: Of the Means of Regenerating the Percheron Horse; Regeneration of the Percheron Breed", "readers": [18978], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/percheronhorse_2407_librivox/percheronhorse_07_duhays_64kb.mp3", "duration": 190}, {"section": 8, "title": "Regeneration of the Breed through itself or by Selection", "readers": [7756], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/percheronhorse_2407_librivox/percheronhorse_08_duhays_64kb.mp3", "duration": 625}, {"section": 9, "title": "Consanguinity", "readers": [19100], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/percheronhorse_2407_librivox/percheronhorse_09_duhays_64kb.mp3", "duration": 319}, {"section": 10, "title": "Ought the gray coat of the Percheron to be inflexibly maintained?", "readers": [18946], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/percheronhorse_2407_librivox/percheronhorse_10_duhays_64kb.mp3", "duration": 385}, {"section": 11, "title": "Preserve pure, and without Mixture the three Types of the Percheron Race\u2014the Light Horse, the Draft-Horse, the Intermediate Horse", "readers": [19556], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/percheronhorse_2407_librivox/percheronhorse_11_duhays_64kb.mp3", "duration": 573}, {"section": 12, "title": "Improvement of the Breed by means of Foreign Crossings", "readers": [19539], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/percheronhorse_2407_librivox/percheronhorse_12_duhays_64kb.mp3", "duration": 435}, {"section": 13, "title": "The Arab Cross", "readers": [19556], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/percheronhorse_2407_librivox/percheronhorse_13_duhays_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1737}, {"section": 14, "title": "The English Cross", "readers": [7389], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/percheronhorse_2407_librivox/percheronhorse_14_duhays_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1169}, {"section": 15, "title": "Improvement by means of the Stud-book", "readers": [18979], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/percheronhorse_2407_librivox/percheronhorse_15_duhays_64kb.mp3", "duration": 600}, {"section": 16, "title": "Part Third: Information to Strangers wishing to buy Percheron Horses", "readers": [17334], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/percheronhorse_2407_librivox/percheronhorse_16_duhays_64kb.mp3", "duration": 319}, {"section": 17, "title": "Food and Breeding", "readers": [3681], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/percheronhorse_2407_librivox/percheronhorse_17_duhays_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1178}, {"section": 18, "title": "Trade.
