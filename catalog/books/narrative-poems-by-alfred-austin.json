{"title": "Narrative Poems", "description": "Alfred Austin (1835 - 1913) became English Poet Laureate after the death of Tennyson. He was awarded the post only after several other poets had either refused the honour or had been rejected as being too controversial. It has been surmised that Austin's appointment was due largely to the enthusaistic support of  his associates in the Conservative Party. Austin was a very prolific poet,  but unfortunuately his high opinion of his own verse was not shared by his contemporaries. This collection of twenty-one poems covers a wide range of subjects, including a tribute to the Prostestant martyr John Huss. - Summary by Algy Pug", "duration": 12990, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "8143", "name": "Alfred Austin"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/narrative_poems_2310_librivox/narrative_poems_2310.jpg", "copyright_year": "1896", "genres": ["Poetry"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Algy Pug"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Sonia"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "afutterer"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Dedication", "readers": [4705], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/narrative_poems_2310_librivox/narrativepoems_00_austin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 236}, {"section": 1, "title": "A Dialogue at Fiesole", "readers": [6924, 8425], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/narrative_poems_2310_librivox/narrativepoems_01_austin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1392}, {"section": 2, "title": "Ave Maria", "readers": [17246], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/narrative_poems_2310_librivox/narrativepoems_02_austin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 332}, {"section": 3, "title": "Agatha", "readers": [4705], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/narrative_poems_2310_librivox/narrativepoems_03_austin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 141}, {"section": 4, "title": "A Woman's Apology", "readers": [18727], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/narrative_poems_2310_librivox/narrativepoems_04_austin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 779}, {"section": 5, "title": "The Death of Huss", "readers": [8425], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/narrative_poems_2310_librivox/narrativepoems_05_austin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 173}, {"section": 6, "title": "The Last Redoubt", "readers": [7170], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/narrative_poems_2310_librivox/narrativepoems_06_austin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 239}, {"section": 7, "title": "A Farmhouse Dirge", "readers": [17662], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/narrative_poems_2310_librivox/narrativepoems_07_austin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 638}, {"section": 8, "title": "Outside the Village Church", "readers": [8425], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/narrative_poems_2310_librivox/narrativepoems_08_austin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 433}, {"section": 9, "title": "At San Giovanni Del Lago", "readers": [4705], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/narrative_poems_2310_librivox/narrativepoems_09_austin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 296}, {"section": 10, "title": "The Last Night", "readers": [17662], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/narrative_poems_2310_librivox/narrativepoems_10_austin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 354}, {"section": 11, "title": "Nature and the Book", "readers": [11585], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/narrative_poems_2310_librivox/narrativepoems_11_austin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 421}, {"section": 12, "title": "Grandmother's Teaching", "readers": [18895], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/narrative_poems_2310_librivox/narrativepoems_12_austin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 821}, {"section": 13, "title": "Two Visions", "readers": [16664], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/narrative_poems_2310_librivox/narrativepoems_13_austin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 493}, {"section": 14, "title": "A Fragment", "readers": [11331], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/narrative_poems_2310_librivox/narrativepoems_14_austin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1506}, {"section": 15, "title": "At Shelley's House at Lerici", "readers": [7170], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/narrative_poems_2310_librivox/narrativepoems_15_austin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 450}, {"section": 16, "title": "In the Heart of the Forest", "readers": [18731], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/narrative_poems_2310_librivox/narrativepoems_16_austin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 402}, {"section": 17, "title": "At the Gate of the Covent", "readers": [4705], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/narrative_poems_2310_librivox/narrativepoems_17_austin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 773}, {"section": 18, "title": "Brother Benedict", "readers": [17662], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/narrative_poems_2310_librivox/narrativepoems_18_austin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 415}, {"section": 19, "title": "In the Month When Sings the Cuckoo", "readers": [15932], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/narrative_poems_2310_librivox/narrativepoems_19_austin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 426}, {"section": 20, "title": "Love's Widowhood", "readers": [4705, 17246], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/narrative_poems_2310_librivox/narrativepoems_20_austin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2270}]}
