The book's title derives from a speech given by Holmes to Doctor Watson on the nature of his work, in which he describes the story's murder investigation as his \"study in scarlet\": \"There's the scarlet thread of murder running through the colourless skein of life, and our duty is to unravel it, and isolate it, and expose every inch of it.\"  (A \"study\" is a preliminary drawing, sketch or painting done in preparation for a finished piece.)\n - Summary by David Clarke", "duration": 16654, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "467", "name": "Sir Arthur Conan Doyle"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/studyscarletv6_1412_librivox/study_scarlet_1412.jpg", "copyright_year": "1887", "genres": ["Detective Fiction"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "David Clarke"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "David Clarke"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Karen Savage"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "DaveC"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Mr Sherlock Holmes", "readers": [7408], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/studyscarletv6_1412_librivox/studyinscarlet_01_doyle_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1073}, {"section": 2, "title": "The Science of Deduction", "readers": [7408], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/studyscarletv6_1412_librivox/studyinscarlet_02_doyle_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1345}, {"section": 3, "title": "The Lauriston Garden Mystery", "readers": [7408], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/studyscarletv6_1412_librivox/studyinscarlet_03_doyle_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1445}, {"section": 4, "title": "What John Rance Had to Tell", "readers": [7408], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/studyscarletv6_1412_librivox/studyinscarlet_04_doyle_64kb.mp3", "duration": 920}, {"section": 5, "title": "Our Advertisement Brings A Visitor", "readers": [7408], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/studyscarletv6_1412_librivox/studyinscarlet_05_doyle_64kb.mp3", "duration": 939}, {"section": 6, "title": "Tobias Gregson Shows What He Can Do", "readers": [7408], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/studyscarletv6_1412_librivox/studyinscarlet_06_doyle_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1248}, {"section": 7, "title": "Light In the Darkness", "readers": [7408], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/studyscarletv6_1412_librivox/studyinscarlet_07_doyle_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1247}, {"section": 8, "title": "On The Great Alkali Plain", "readers": [7408], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/studyscarletv6_1412_librivox/studyinscarlet_08_doyle_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1489}, {"section": 9, "title": "The Flower of Utah", "readers": [7408], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/studyscarletv6_1412_librivox/studyinscarlet_09_doyle_64kb.mp3", "duration": 997}, {"section": 10, "title": "John Ferrier Talks With the Prophet", "readers": [7408], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/studyscarletv6_1412_librivox/studyinscarlet_10_doyle_64kb.mp3", "duration": 756}, {"section": 11, "title": "A Flight For Life", "readers": [7408], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/studyscarletv6_1412_librivox/studyinscarlet_11_doyle_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1296}, {"section": 12, "title": "The Avenging Angels", "readers": [7408], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/studyscarletv6_1412_librivox/studyinscarlet_12_doyle_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1385}, {"section": 13, "title": "A Continuation of the Reminiscences of John Watson MD", "readers": [7408], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/studyscarletv6_1412_librivox/studyinscarlet_13_doyle_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1651}, {"section": 14, "title": "The Conclusion", "readers": [7408], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/studyscarletv6_1412_librivox/studyinscarlet_14_doyle_64kb.mp3", "duration": 863}]}
