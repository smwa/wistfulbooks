{"title": "Aspects of the Novel", "description": "This s a series of lectures given at Trinity College by the acclaimed author E.M. Forster (A Passage to India, Howard's End, A Room With a View) . In them, he discusses \"both the different ways we can look at a novel and the different ways a novelist can look at his work.\" The aspects of the novel Forster discusses are the story, people, plot,, fantasy, prophecy and rhythm. While this is a work of academic analysis and not what one expects in a Forster work, the author's wit and voice help make the book very accessible and engaging.  - Summary by Ciufi Galeazzi", "duration": 18153, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "1983", "name": "E.
