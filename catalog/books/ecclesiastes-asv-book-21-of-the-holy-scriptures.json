The author of this book is unknown but is considered by many biblical scholars to be Solomon.The author describes how all endeavors in life are in vain and a grasping for the wind, since all comes to naught in the end when we return to the dust from whence we came. The generations to come will not remember us. In the end, The Preacher admonishes us that the only purpose for man is to eat, drink and perform his labors under the sun and to do it with happiness and devotion to God.This reading comes from the American Standard Version (ASV) of The Holy Bible.
