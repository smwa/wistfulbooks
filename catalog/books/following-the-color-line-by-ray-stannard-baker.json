{"title": "Following the Color Line", "description": "Subtitled \"An Account of Negro Citizenship in the American Democracy\", we are presented an in-depth and essentially non-opinionated open view of race relations as they existed in the U.S. in 1908, more than 40 years following the end of the Civil War.<br /><br />The book is in three parts: The Negro in the South; The Negro in the North; and the Negro in the Nation. We are presented both rural and urban points of view, struggles for survival, varying district relationships, the effect of lynching, power struggles, and political repercussions, among many other topics.  -
