{"title": "Bible (WNT) NT 11: Philippians", "description": "In his letter to the believers in the city of Philippi (in the province of ancient Macedonia), the Apostle Paul exudes an attitude of JOY, in spite of his own imprisonment and impending trial.  He preaches of unity as a matter of contention and conflict arises in the fellowship, encouraging them to settle the matter and come together as the Body of Christ.  He sees attempts on the part of those who would have the believers sink back into the Law of Moses, and reassures the believers in Christ that He, not the Law, is sufficient for eternal life.  He seems to say, \"Be JOYOUS, UNITED, and SATISFIED with and in Christ, my children!!!\"   - Summary by Mark Penfold", "duration": 999, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "4721", "name": " Weymouth New Testament"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/wnt_philippians_1807_librivox/wnt_philippians_1807.jpg", "copyright_year": "1913", "genres": ["Weymouth New Testament"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Mark Penfold"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Mark Penfold"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "TriciaG"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Beth Thomas (1974-2020)"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Phillippians", "readers": [2149], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/wnt_philippians_1807_librivox/philippians_1_weymouth_64kb.mp3", "duration": 999}]}
