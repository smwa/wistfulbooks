{"title": "How to Write a Novel", "description": "I address myself to the man or woman of talent\u2014those people who have writing ability, but who need instruction in the manipulation of characters, the formation of plots, and a host of other points with which I shall deal hereafter. Although no school could turn out novelists to order there is yet enough common material in all art-work to be mapped out in a course of lessons. I shall show that the two great requisites of novel-writing are (1) a good story to tell, and (2) ability to tell it effectively. Briefly stated, my position is this: no teaching can produce \"good stories to tell,\" but it can increase the power of \"the telling,\" and change it from crude and ineffective methods to those which reach the apex of developed art.  - Summary from the preface", "duration": 9613, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "19", "name": " Anonymous"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/how_to_write_a_novel_1502_librivox/how_to_write_a_novel_1502.jpg", "copyright_year": "1901", "genres": ["*Non-fiction", "Writing & Linguistics"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Brett W.
