{"title": "If I knew What Poets Know", "description": "LibriVox volunteers bring you 23 recordings of If I knew What Poets Know by James Whitcomb Riley.<br>\nThis was the Weekly Poetry project for July 5, 2020. <br> ------<br>Riley's chief legacy was his influence in fostering the creation of a Midwestern cultural identity and his contributions to the Golden Age of Indiana Literature. With other writers of his era, he helped create a caricature of Midwesterners and formed a literary community that produced works rivaling the established eastern literati. There are many memorials dedicated to Riley, including the James Whitcomb Riley Hospital for Children.
