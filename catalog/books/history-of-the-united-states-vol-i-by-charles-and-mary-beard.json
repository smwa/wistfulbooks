{"title": "History of the United States, Vol. I", "description": "Charles Austin Beard was the most influential American historian of the early 20th century. He published hundreds of monographs, textbooks and interpretive studies in both history and political science. He graduated from DePauw University in 1898, where he met and eventually married Mary Ritter Beard, one of the founders of the first greek-letter society for women, Kappa Alpha Theta. Many of his books were written in collaboration with his wife, whose own interests lay in feminism and the labor union movement (Woman as a Force in History, 1946).</br></br>In 1921, Charles and Mary Beard published their History of the United States. A contemporaneous review stated: The authors\u2026 assume enough maturity in high school students to justify a topical rather than a chronological treatment. They have dealt with movements, have sketched large backgrounds, have traced causes, and have discussed the interrelation of social and economic forces and politics. All this has been directed to the large purpose of helping the student to understand American today in all its national characteristics and as part of world civilization as well\u2026The literary style is exceptionally clear and crisp, and the whole approach\u2026is thought producing. As a textbook or handbook for the average citizen it ranks with very best.", "duration": 9833, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "2166", "name": "Charles Austin Beard"}, {"id": "2167", "name": "Mary Ritter Beard"}], "coverArt": "http://www.archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt4/History_US_V1_Colonial_Period_1109.jpg", "copyright_year": "1921", "genres": ["*Non-fiction", "History"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "ML Cohen"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Kirsten Ferreri"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Preface", "readers": [128], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/us_history_vol1_librivox/historyoftheUSpt1_00_charlesandmarybeard_64kb.mp3", "duration": 423}, {"section": 1, "title": "The Great Migration to America/The Agencies of American Colonization", "readers": [1314], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/us_history_vol1_librivox/historyoftheUSpt1_01_charlesandmarybeard_64kb.mp3", "duration": 699}, {"section": 2, "title": "The Colonial Peoples", "readers": [19], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/us_history_vol1_librivox/historyoftheUSpt1_02_charlesandmarybeard_64kb.mp3", "duration": 675}, {"section": 3, "title": "The Process of Colonization", "readers": [949], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/us_history_vol1_librivox/historyoftheUSpt1_03_charlesandmarybeard_64kb.mp3", "duration": 723}, {"section": 4, "title": "Colonial Agriculture, Industry, and Commerce/The Land and the Westward Movement", "readers": [237], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/us_history_vol1_librivox/historyoftheUSpt1_04_charlesandmarybeard_64kb.mp3", "duration": 951}, {"section": 5, "title": "Industrial and Commercial Development", "readers": [1401], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/us_history_vol1_librivox/historyoftheUSpt1_05_charlesandmarybeard_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1132}, {"section": 6, "title": "Social and Political Progress/The Leadership of the Churches", "readers": [1323], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/us_history_vol1_librivox/historyoftheUSpt1_06_charlesandmarybeard_64kb.mp3", "duration": 731}, {"section": 7, "title": "Schools and Colleges", "readers": [1401], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/us_history_vol1_librivox/historyoftheUSpt1_07_charlesandmarybeard_64kb.mp3", "duration": 400}, {"section": 8, "title": "The Colonial Press", "readers": [470], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/us_history_vol1_librivox/historyoftheUSpt1_08_charlesandmarybeard_64kb.mp3", "duration": 427}, {"section": 9, "title": "The Evolution in Political Institutions", "readers": [1401], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/us_history_vol1_librivox/historyoftheUSpt1_09_charlesandmarybeard_64kb.mp3", "duration": 839}, {"section": 10, "title": "The Development of Colonial Nationalism/Relations with the Indians and the French", "readers": [1403], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/us_history_vol1_librivox/historyoftheUSpt1_10_charlesandmarybeard_64kb.mp3", "duration": 650}, {"section": 11, "title": "The Effects of Warfare on the Colonies", "readers": [19], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/us_history_vol1_librivox/historyoftheUSpt1_11_charlesandmarybeard_64kb.mp3", "duration": 490}, {"section": 12, "title": "Colonial Relations with the British Government", "readers": [1401], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/us_history_vol1_librivox/historyoftheUSpt1_12_charlesandmarybeard_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1076}, {"section": 13, "title": "Summary of Colonial Period", "readers": [128], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/us_history_vol1_librivox/historyoftheUSpt1_13_charlesandmarybeard_64kb.mp3", "duration": 617}]}
