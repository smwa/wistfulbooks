{"title": "Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions (version 2)", "description": "This is a satirical novel written by Edwin A. Abbott, first published in 1884. Abbott uses a two-dimensional world, with himself as the protagonist, known simply as \"A Square\", to deride the Victorian aristocracy and its hierarchies. But the book has retained its value throughout the years for its unique portrayal of a two-dimensional world, and how a Sphere introduces the  Square to the incomprehensible possibility of a third dimension. Once the square fully understands the third dimension, he suggests to the Sphere that even a fourth, fifth, or sixth dimension could exist. But the Sphere sends the square back to his two-dimensional world, where he cannot convince anyone of the existence of a three dimensional world. - Summary by Linda Olsen Fitak <br> \nRead by Linda Olsen Fitak and Aaron White.", "duration": 16262, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "9567", "name": "Edwin Abbott Abbott"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/flatland_version_2_1901_librivox/flatland_1901.jpg", "copyright_year": "1884", "genres": ["Humorous Fiction", "Satire", "Published 1800 -1900"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Linda Olsen Fitak"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Aaron White"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "DaveC"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "PREFACE TO THE SECOND AND REVISED EDITION, 1884, BY THE EDITOR", "readers": [11772], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/flatland_version_2_1901_librivox/flatland_00_abbott_64kb.mp3", "duration": 722}, {"section": 1, "title": "Of the Nature of Flatland", "readers": [11772], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/flatland_version_2_1901_librivox/flatland_01_abbott_64kb.mp3", "duration": 355}, {"section": 2, "title": "Of the Climate and Houses in Flatland", "readers": [11772], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/flatland_version_2_1901_librivox/flatland_02_abbott_64kb.mp3", "duration": 420}, {"section": 3, "title": "Concerning the Inhabitants of Flatland", "readers": [11772], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/flatland_version_2_1901_librivox/flatland_03_abbott_64kb.mp3", "duration": 720}, {"section": 4, "title": "Concerning the Women", "readers": [11772], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/flatland_version_2_1901_librivox/flatland_04_abbott_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1013}, {"section": 5, "title": "Of Our Methods of Recognizing One Another", "readers": [11772], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/flatland_version_2_1901_librivox/flatland_05_abbott_64kb.mp3", "duration": 950}, {"section": 6, "title": "Of Recognition by Sight", "readers": [11772], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/flatland_version_2_1901_librivox/flatland_06_abbott_64kb.mp3", "duration": 944}, {"section": 7, "title": "Concerning Irregular Figures", "readers": [11772], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/flatland_version_2_1901_librivox/flatland_07_abbott_64kb.mp3", "duration": 659}, {"section": 8, "title": "Of the Ancient Practice of Painting", "readers": [11772], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/flatland_version_2_1901_librivox/flatland_08_abbott_64kb.mp3", "duration": 544}, {"section": 9, "title": "Of the Universal Colour Bill", "readers": [11772], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/flatland_version_2_1901_librivox/flatland_09_abbott_64kb.mp3", "duration": 658}, {"section": 10, "title": "Of the Suppression of the Chromatic Sedition", "readers": [11772], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/flatland_version_2_1901_librivox/flatland_10_abbott_64kb.mp3", "duration": 791}, {"section": 11, "title": "Concerning Our Priests", "readers": [11772], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/flatland_version_2_1901_librivox/flatland_11_abbott_64kb.mp3", "duration": 516}, {"section": 12, "title": "Of the Doctrine of Our Priests", "readers": [11772], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/flatland_version_2_1901_librivox/flatland_12_abbott_64kb.mp3", "duration": 875}, {"section": 13, "title": "How I had a Vision of Lineland", "readers": [11772], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/flatland_version_2_1901_librivox/flatland_13_abbott_64kb.mp3", "duration": 792}, {"section": 14, "title": "How I Vainly Tried to Explain the Nature of Flatland", "readers": [12874], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/flatland_version_2_1901_librivox/flatland_14_abbott_64kb.mp3", "duration": 812}, {"section": 15, "title": "Concerning a Stranger from Spaceland", "readers": [12874], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/flatland_version_2_1901_librivox/flatland_15_abbott_64kb.mp3", "duration": 553}, {"section": 16, "title": "How the Stranger Vainly Endeavored to Reveal to Me in Words the Mysteries of Spaceland", "readers": [12874], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/flatland_version_2_1901_librivox/flatland_16_abbott_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1254}, {"section": 17, "title": "How the Sphere, having in vain tried words, resorted to deeds", "readers": [12874], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/flatland_version_2_1901_librivox/flatland_17_abbott_64kb.mp3", "duration": 368}, {"section": 18, "title": "How I came to Spaceland, and what I saw there", "readers": [12874], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/flatland_version_2_1901_librivox/flatland_18_abbott_64kb.mp3", "duration": 722}, {"section": 19, "title": "How, though the Sphere shewed me other mysteries of Spaceland, I still desire more;
