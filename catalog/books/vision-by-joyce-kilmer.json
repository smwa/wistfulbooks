Though a prolific poet whose works celebrated the common beauty of the natural world as well as his Roman Catholic religious faith, Kilmer was also a journalist, literary critic, lecturer, and editor. He was deployed to France with the 69th Infantry Regiment (the famous \"Fighting 69th\") in 1917. He was killed by a sniper's bullet at the Second Battle of the Marne in 1918 at the age of 31. He was married to Aline Murray, also an accomplished poet and author, with whom he had five children. - Summary by Wikipedia", "duration": 832, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "1341", "name": "Joyce Kilmer"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/vision_2110.poem_librivox/vision_2110.jpg", "copyright_year": "1914", "genres": ["Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "David Lawrence"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Vision - Read by AC", "readers": [16696], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/vision_2110.poem_librivox/vision_kilmer_ac_64kb.mp3", "duration": 52}, {"section": 2, "title": "Vision - Read by BC", "readers": [14624], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/vision_2110.poem_librivox/vision_kilmer_bc_64kb.mp3", "duration": 49}, {"section": 3, "title": "Vision - Read by BK", "readers": [8786], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/vision_2110.poem_librivox/vision_kilmer_bk_64kb.mp3", "duration": 53}, {"section": 4, "title": "Vision - Read by CF", "readers": [11305], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/vision_2110.poem_librivox/vision_kilmer_cf_64kb.mp3", "duration": 55}, {"section": 5, "title": "Vision - Read by CSM", "readers": [16706], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/vision_2110.poem_librivox/vision_kilmer_csm_64kb.mp3", "duration": 52}, {"section": 6, "title": "Vision - Read by EL0", "readers": [9872], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/vision_2110.poem_librivox/vision_kilmer_el0_64kb.mp3", "duration": 66}, {"section": 7, "title": "Vision - Read by HDL", "readers": [16702], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/vision_2110.poem_librivox/vision_kilmer_hdl_64kb.mp3", "duration": 39}, {"section": 8, "title": "Vision - Read by KLA", "readers": [16550], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/vision_2110.poem_librivox/vision_kilmer_kla_64kb.mp3", "duration": 63}, {"section": 9, "title": "Vision - Read by LAH", "readers": [1212], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/vision_2110.poem_librivox/vision_kilmer_lah_64kb.mp3", "duration": 53}, {"section": 10, "title": "Vision - Read by LCW", "readers": [8425], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/vision_2110.poem_librivox/vision_kilmer_lcw_64kb.mp3", "duration": 51}, {"section": 11, "title": "Vision - Read by LS", "readers": [15365], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/vision_2110.poem_librivox/vision_kilmer_ls_64kb.mp3", "duration": 54}, {"section": 12, "title": "Vision - Read by MA", "readers": [16692], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/vision_2110.poem_librivox/vision_kilmer_ma_64kb.mp3", "duration": 45}, {"section": 13, "title": "Vision - Read by PLM", "readers": [13243], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/vision_2110.poem_librivox/vision_kilmer_plm_64kb.mp3", "duration": 53}, {"section": 14, "title": "Vision - Read by PS", "readers": [8576], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/vision_2110.poem_librivox/vision_kilmer_ps_64kb.mp3", "duration": 50}, {"section": 15, "title": "Vision - Read by R", "readers": [6924], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/vision_2110.poem_librivox/vision_kilmer_r_64kb.mp3", "duration": 46}, {"section": 16, "title": "Vision - Read by RNT", "readers": [11244], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/vision_2110.poem_librivox/vision_kilmer_rnt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 51}]}
