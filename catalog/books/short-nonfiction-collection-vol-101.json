{"title": "Short Nonfiction Collection, Vol. 101", "description": "\"Of all effects of weather, snow makes the greatest change in animal economy in the countryside, and weeks often pass before the old order is restored.\" [English Animals in Snow.] Many of the reader-chosen selections in vol. 101 look at disruptions in the status quo. Weather features in A Drop of 4000 feet; Geographic Aspect of Culture; and Effects of Weather Upon Death Rate and Crime in India. The impact of disease is made clear in The History of Syphilis. The disruptive power of technology is shown in Thomas Edison, Greatest of Inventors. Societal and religious strife are examined in Property (1792); Executive Order to Eliminate Woke, Anti-Women Words; Murdering English; Good Looking Teachers Get Best Results; Proclamation Establishing the 8-hour Workday; and Edmund Campion, Letter to Her Majestie's Privy Council. War and its aftermath are the subject of The Present Crisis in China; Treaty of Shimonoseki; Japan's Ultimatum to Germany; Colonization of Palestine; Mexico in Revolt; Battle of Stone River; and Pardon for the Offense of Treason Against the United States During the Late Civil War.
