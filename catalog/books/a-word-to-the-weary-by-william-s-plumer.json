{"title": "Word to the Weary", "description": "Sin and sorrow are twin sisters. They were born the same day. They have grown up together. It is as idle to say that there is no misery as to assert that there is no wickedness in the world. Some men seem to be uniformly prosperous. They appear to have but few trials. They have more than heart can wish. They are receiving their good things in this life. They are the abhorred of the Lord. Their eternity will be rueful. Yet even they have their seasons of weariness. And the mass of men have many and palpable sorrows. This is always true of the godly in this life: \"Many are the afflictions of the righteous.\" \"Whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.\" The tears of God's people often flow, day and night. Waters of a full cup are wrung out to them. Oh, the weariness of good men! It has many causes. - Summary by William S.
