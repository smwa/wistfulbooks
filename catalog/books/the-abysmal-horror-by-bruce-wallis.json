{"title": "Abysmal Horror", "description": "While on holiday at an inexpensive English seaside resort, twenty-six-year-old Batson was contemplating the monotony of his life when he witnesses an enormous meteor pass overhead.  It ultimately crashes into a marshy field not 30 minutes from London. Its immense size and metallic composition lead experts to believe that this was not a typical meteor but likely a piece of a planet from some unknown distant location.  What the public did not know at the time was that, while flying through the Earth\u2019s upper atmospheric stratospheres, dormant seeds from this exoplanetary piece were swept off and scattered across the globe.  These seeds find conditions on Earth to be excellent for their growth, and soon this alien life form multiplies to levels that threaten life on both land and sea.  A more formidable foe has never been encountered by humankind.  Can the world\u2019s populace come together as a single human family to find a solution to combat this existential alien threat, before it is too late?   - Summary by Warren Kati", "duration": 9463, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "17474", "name": "Bruce Wallis"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/abysmalhorror_2502_librivox/abysmal_horror_2502.jpg", "copyright_year": "1924", "genres": ["Science Fiction"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Warren Kati"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Warren Kati"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Christine Rottger"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Christine Rottger"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Section 1", "readers": [11223], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/abysmalhorror_2502_librivox/abysmalhorror_01_wallis_64kb.mp3", "duration": 884}, {"section": 2, "title": "Section 2", "readers": [11223], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/abysmalhorror_2502_librivox/abysmalhorror_02_wallis_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1297}, {"section": 3, "title": "Section 3", "readers": [11223], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/abysmalhorror_2502_librivox/abysmalhorror_03_wallis_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1727}, {"section": 4, "title": "Section 4", "readers": [11223], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/abysmalhorror_2502_librivox/abysmalhorror_04_wallis_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1561}, {"section": 5, "title": "Section 5", "readers": [11223], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/abysmalhorror_2502_librivox/abysmalhorror_05_wallis_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1348}, {"section": 6, "title": "Section 6", "readers": [11223], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/abysmalhorror_2502_librivox/abysmalhorror_06_wallis_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1497}, {"section": 7, "title": "Section 7", "readers": [11223], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/abysmalhorror_2502_librivox/abysmalhorror_07_wallis_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1149}]}
