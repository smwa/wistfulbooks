{"title": "Whisper in the Dark", "description": "<i>A Whisper in the Dark</i> was published anonymously in 1877 and again in 1889, this time attributed to Louisa May Alcott, along with A Modern Mephistopheles. This story is a far cry from Alcott\u2019s usual light fare for children. It\u2019s a dark and melodramatic tale about Sybil, a young girl of seventeen, an orphan under the guardianship of her uncle and raised by a \u201cMadame Bernard,\u201d who is kind but tells her little of her origins. She slowly pieces together the truth, falling in love along the way but, after a misunderstanding, is imprisoned and nearly driven mad. This sensational novella is likely an example of the kind of story that Alcott\u2019s Little Women character Jo March pumps out to buy \u201ccomforts for\u201d the March family until she comes to her senses and burns all the manuscripts, realizing that they \u201care trash, \u2026 each \u2026 more sensational than the last.\u201d - Summary by Winnifred Assmann", "duration": 6642, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "93", "name": "Louisa May Alcott"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/whisperindark_2304_librivox/awhisperinthedark_2304.jpg", "copyright_year": "1889", "genres": ["Published 1800 -1900"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Winnifred Assmann"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Rapunzelina"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Elsie Selwyn"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Section 1", "readers": [16209], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/whisperindark_2304_librivox/whisperinthedark_1_alcott_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1382}, {"section": 2, "title": "Section 2", "readers": [18406], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/whisperindark_2304_librivox/whisperinthedark_2_alcott_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1171}, {"section": 3, "title": "Section 3", "readers": [18406], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/whisperindark_2304_librivox/whisperinthedark_3_alcott_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1664}, {"section": 4, "title": "Section 4", "readers": [18124], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/whisperindark_2304_librivox/whisperinthedark_4_alcott_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1261}, {"section": 5, "title": "Section 5", "readers": [18124], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/whisperindark_2304_librivox/whisperinthedark_5_alcott_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1164}]}
