{"title": "I Stepped from Plank to Plank", "description": "LibriVox volunteers bring you 13 recordings of I Stepped from Plank to Plank by Emily Dickinson. This was the Weekly Poetry project for August 21, 2011.<br><br>Emily Elizabeth Dickinson was an American poet. Born in Amherst, Massachusetts, to a successful family with strong community ties, she lived a mostly introverted and reclusive life. Thought of as an eccentric by the locals, she became known for her penchant for white clothing and her reluctance to greet guests or, later in life, even leave her room. Most of her friendships were therefore carried out by correspondence.( Summary by Wikipedia)", "duration": 543, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "23", "name": "Emily Dickinson"}], "coverArt": "http://archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt23/I_Stepped_Plank_Plank_1210.jpg", "copyright_year": "0", "genres": ["Poetry", "Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "I Stepped from Plank to Plank - Read by ALG", "readers": [4744], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/planktoplank_1108_librivox/planktoplank_dickinson_alg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 43}, {"section": 2, "title": "I Stepped from Plank to Plank - Read by DL", "readers": [2911], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/planktoplank_1108_librivox/planktoplank_dickinson_dl_64kb.mp3", "duration": 40}, {"section": 3, "title": "I Stepped from Plank to Plank - Read by EP", "readers": [2525], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/planktoplank_1108_librivox/planktoplank_dickinson_ep_64kb.mp3", "duration": 40}, {"section": 4, "title": "I Stepped from Plank to Plank - Read by EZWA", "readers": [123], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/planktoplank_1108_librivox/planktoplank_dickinson_ezwa_64kb.mp3", "duration": 36}, {"section": 5, "title": "I Stepped from Plank to Plank - Read by GB", "readers": [4969], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/planktoplank_1108_librivox/planktoplank_dickinson_gb_64kb.mp3", "duration": 44}, {"section": 6, "title": "I Stepped from Plank to Plank - Read by GHS", "readers": [4705], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/planktoplank_1108_librivox/planktoplank_dickinson_ghs_64kb.mp3", "duration": 43}, {"section": 7, "title": "I Stepped from Plank to Plank - Read by HWS", "readers": [6776], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/planktoplank_1108_librivox/planktoplank_dickinson_hws_64kb.mp3", "duration": 48}, {"section": 8, "title": "I Stepped from Plank to Plank - Read by JBS", "readers": [77], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/planktoplank_1108_librivox/planktoplank_dickinson_jbs_64kb.mp3", "duration": 37}, {"section": 9, "title": "I Stepped from Plank to Plank - Read by LAH", "readers": [1212], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/planktoplank_1108_librivox/planktoplank_dickinson_lah_64kb.mp3", "duration": 43}, {"section": 10, "title": "I Stepped from Plank to Plank - Read by LL", "readers": [2758], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/planktoplank_1108_librivox/planktoplank_dickinson_ll_64kb.mp3", "duration": 38}, {"section": 11, "title": "I Stepped from Plank to Plank - Read by LLB", "readers": [6707], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/planktoplank_1108_librivox/planktoplank_dickinson_llb_64kb.mp3", "duration": 41}, {"section": 12, "title": "I stepped from Plank to Plank - Read by REF", "readers": [2269], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/planktoplank_1108_librivox/planktoplank_dickinson_ref_64kb.mp3", "duration": 40}, {"section": 13, "title": "I Stepped from Plank to Plank - Read by RN", "readers": [3465], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/planktoplank_1108_librivox/planktoplank_dickinson_rn_64kb.mp3", "duration": 50}]}
