{"title": "Colonel Chabert (Version 2)", "description": "The short novel \u201cColonel Chabert\u201d (1832) is part of Balzac\u2019s great life work, the sprawling novel series titled \u201cThe Human Comedy.\u201d \r\n<br><br>\r\nChabert, an officer in Napoleon\u2019s army, is pronounced dead on the battlefield. His wife then inherits his estate and remarries. It turns out, however, that Chabert has in fact survived the war. When he regains his health, he returns to Paris and tries to take legal action to restore his position. This sets up a conflict between the old military virtues of honor and principle versus the avarice and amorality of society in post-Napoleonic France. - Summary by Bruce Pirie", "duration": 10916, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "86", "name": "Honor\u00e9 de Balzac"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/colonelchabert_2306_librivox/colonelchabert_2306.jpg", "copyright_year": "1899", "genres": ["Literary Fiction", "Published 1800 -1900"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Bruce Pirie"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Bruce Pirie"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "J.
