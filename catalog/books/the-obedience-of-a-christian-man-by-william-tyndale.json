{"title": "Obedience of a Christian Man", "description": "\"The obedience of a Christian man\" begins by contrasting the life of a true Christian to those holding high positions within the Romish Church. A scathing attack against the Popes, Cardinals and Bishops living in luxury, who also refrain from teaching Scripture and would rather attach themselves to \"Doctors\" who often contradict themselves. Tyndale compares these men to the statements set forth in Scripture which teach that all men will be persecuted for their faith in Christ.<br><br>\n\nHe then shares his treatise on how Christians of all walks ought to conduct themselves, from servants to rulers, and all members of the household.<br><br>\n\nIt was for works like this that William Tyndale would eventually be executed by strangulation and as many of his works that were found were to be burned. - Summary by David Ronald", "duration": 28701, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "8638", "name": "William Tyndale"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/obedienceofchristianman_2103_librivox/obedience_2103.jpg", "copyright_year": "1831", "genres": ["Christianity - Other"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "David Ronald"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "David Ronald"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Devorah Allen"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Larry Wilson"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Preface", "readers": [14683], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/obedienceofchristianman_2103_librivox/obedienceofachristianman_00_tyndale_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3302}, {"section": 1, "title": "Prologue", "readers": [14683], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/obedienceofchristianman_2103_librivox/obedienceofachristianman_01_tyndale_64kb.mp3", "duration": 710}, {"section": 2, "title": "Obedience of children, wives, servants", "readers": [14683], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/obedienceofchristianman_2103_librivox/obedienceofachristianman_02_tyndale_64kb.mp3", "duration": 753}, {"section": 3, "title": "Obedience of subjects", "readers": [14683], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/obedienceofchristianman_2103_librivox/obedienceofachristianman_03_tyndale_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1955}, {"section": 4, "title": "Against the Pope's false power", "readers": [14683], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/obedienceofchristianman_2103_librivox/obedienceofachristianman_04_tyndale_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1602}, {"section": 5, "title": "The office of father, husband, master and the duty of landlords", "readers": [14683], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/obedienceofchristianman_2103_librivox/obedienceofachristianman_05_tyndale_64kb.mp3", "duration": 529}, {"section": 6, "title": "The duty of Kings, judges and officers", "readers": [14683], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/obedienceofchristianman_2103_librivox/obedienceofachristianman_06_tyndale_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3757}, {"section": 7, "title": "Antichrist", "readers": [14683], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/obedienceofchristianman_2103_librivox/obedienceofachristianman_07_tyndale_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3052}, {"section": 8, "title": "Of the sacraments of the body and blood of Christ, baptism, wedlock, order", "readers": [14683], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/obedienceofchristianman_2103_librivox/obedienceofachristianman_08_tyndale_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1040}, {"section": 9, "title": "Penance, confession, contrition, satisfaction, absolution, confirmation", "readers": [14683], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/obedienceofchristianman_2103_librivox/obedienceofachristianman_09_tyndale_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2279}, {"section": 10, "title": "Anoiling", "readers": [14683], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/obedienceofchristianman_2103_librivox/obedienceofachristianman_10_tyndale_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1650}, {"section": 11, "title": "Of miracles and worshipping saints", "readers": [14683], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/obedienceofchristianman_2103_librivox/obedienceofachristianman_11_tyndale_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1489}, {"section": 12, "title": "Of prayer", "readers": [14683], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/obedienceofchristianman_2103_librivox/obedienceofachristianman_12_tyndale_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1087}, {"section": 13, "title": "The four senses of scripture", "readers": [14683], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/obedienceofchristianman_2103_librivox/obedienceofachristianman_13_tyndale_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3725}, {"section": 14, "title": "A compendious rehearsal of that which goeth before", "readers": [14683], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/obedienceofchristianman_2103_librivox/obedienceofachristianman_14_tyndale_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1771}]}
