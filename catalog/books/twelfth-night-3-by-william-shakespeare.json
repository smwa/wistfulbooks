{"title": "Twelfth Night (version 3)", "description": "Twelfth Night, or What You Wil is a comedy by William Shakespeare, believed to have been written around 1601\u201302 as a Twelfth Night's entertainment for the close of the Christmas season. The play centres on the twins Viola and Sebastian, who are separated in a shipwreck. Viola (who is disguised as a boy) falls in love with Duke Orsino, who in turn is in love with the Countess Olivia. Upon meeting Viola, Countess Olivia falls in love with her thinking she is a man. The play expanded on the musical interludes and riotous disorder expected of the occasion, with plot elements drawn from the short story \"Of Apollonius and Silla\" by Barnabe Rich, based on a story by Matteo Bandello. The first recorded performance was on 2 February 1602, at Candlemas, the formal end of Christmastide in the year's calendar. The play was not published until its inclusion in the 1623 First Folio. - Summary by \nWikipedia<br>\nSonia (Kitty) -- SEBASTIAN, brother to Viola,SIR ANDREW AGUECHEEK,VIOLA<br>\nLindaB -- ORSINO, Duke of Illyria.MARIA, Olivia's waiting woman. <br>\nJohn Farrell -- FABIAN, servant to Olivia<br>\nTony Addison (Adonis) -- ANTONIO, a sea captain, friend to Sebastian,VALENTINE, gentleman attending on the Duke,FESTE, a clown, servant to Olivia,OLIVIA, a rich countess<br>\nJohn Burlinson -- A SEA CAPTAIN, friend to Viola,CURIO, gentleman attending on the Duke,SIR TOBY BELCH, uncle to Olivia,MALVOLIO, steward to Olivia,Two Officers,Servant", "duration": 11213, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "37", "name": "William Shakespeare"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/twelfth_night_3_1608_librivox/twelfthnight1608.jpg", "copyright_year": "0", "genres": ["Comedy"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "John Burlinson"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Annise"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Sonia"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Act One", "readers": [], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/twelfth_night_3_1608_librivox/twelfthnight3_01_shakespeare_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2709}, {"section": 2, "title": "Act Two", "readers": [], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/twelfth_night_3_1608_librivox/twelfthnight3_02_shakespeare_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2779}, {"section": 3, "title": "Act Three", "readers": [], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/twelfth_night_3_1608_librivox/twelfthnight3_03_shakespeare_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2810}, {"section": 4, "title": "Act Four", "readers": [], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/twelfth_night_3_1608_librivox/twelfthnight3_04_shakespeare_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1092}, {"section": 5, "title": "Act Five", "readers": [], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/twelfth_night_3_1608_librivox/twelfthnight3_05_shakespeare_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1823}]}
