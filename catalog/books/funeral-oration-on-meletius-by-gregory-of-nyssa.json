{"title": "Funeral Oration on Meletius", "description": "Saint Meletius was Patriarch of Antioch from 360 until his death in 381. One of his last acts was to preside over the First Council of Constantinople, held in 381. Saint Gregory of Nyssa, renown as one of the Cappadocian Fathers, was in attendance, and gave the eulogy at the latter's funeral. However, the text repeatedly alludes to an event of joy in contrast to the repose of Meletius. This refers to the very recent installation of Gregory Nazianzen as Archbishop of Constantinople.  - Summary by The Reader", "duration": 1464, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "11312", "name": " Gregory of Nyssa"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/funeral_oration_meletius_1505_librivox/funeral_oration_1505.jpg", "copyright_year": "1880", "genres": ["Christianity - Other"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "A LibriVox Volunteer"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "A LibriVox Volunteer"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Ann Boulais"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Ann Boulais"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Funeral Oration", "readers": [8368], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/funeral_oration_meletius_1505_librivox/funeralorationmeletius_1_stgregorynyssa_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1464}]}
