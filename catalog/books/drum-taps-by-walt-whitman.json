{"title": "Drum-Taps", "description": "Drum Taps is the next collection of poems published by Walt Whitman after his famous Leaves of Grass.  This collection is a direct response to Whitman's personal observations of the Civil War, many of which come from his volunteer efforts in wartime hospitals.  Despite the miseries of war described, Whitman's poems in Drum Taps assert a steady patriotism in favor of Lincoln's war effort.  Interestingly, the 1915 edition used for this reading includes an introduction from the Times Literary Supplement which draws analogies between the Civil War and the current throes of World War I, enlisting Whitman posthumously as a supporter of the Allied campaign against Germany. - Summary by Expatriate", "duration": 5755, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "588", "name": "Walt Whitman"}], "coverArt": "http://archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt33/drumtaps_1310.jpg", "copyright_year": "1915", "genres": ["Single author"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Expatriate"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Expatriate"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Laurie Anne Walden"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "DaveC"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Introduction", "readers": [8713], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/drum-taps_1310_librivox/drumtaps_00_whitman_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1394}, {"section": 1, "title": "Poems, Part 1", "readers": [8713], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/drum-taps_1310_librivox/drumtaps_01_whitman_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1505}, {"section": 2, "title": "Poems, Part 2", "readers": [8713], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/drum-taps_1310_librivox/drumtaps_02_whitman_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1498}, {"section": 3, "title": "Poems, Part 3", "readers": [8713], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/drum-taps_1310_librivox/drumtaps_03_whitman_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1358}]}
