{"title": "Song of the Guns", "description": "\"A Song of the Guns was written under what are probably the most remarkable conditions in which a poem has ever been composed. The author, who is now serving in Flanders, was present at the battle of Loos, and during a lull in the fighting--when the gunners, who had been sleepless for five nights, were resting like tired dogs under their guns--he jotted down the main theme of the poem. After the battle the artillery brigade to which he was attached was ordered to Ypres, and it was during the long trench warfare in this district, within sight of the ruined tower of Ypres Cathedral, that the poem was finally completed. The last three stanzas were written at midnight in Brigade Headquarters with the German shells screaming over into the ruined town.\" - Summary by Publisher's Note", "duration": 1665, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "12887", "name": "Gilbert Frankau"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/song_of_the_guns_1710_librivox/songguns_1709.jpg", "copyright_year": "1916", "genres": ["Single author"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Nemo"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Nemo"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Ann Boulais"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Eva Davis"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Publisher's Note", "readers": [11535], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/song_of_the_guns_1710_librivox/songoftheguns_00_frankau_64kb.mp3", "duration": 96}, {"section": 1, "title": "A Song of the Guns", "readers": [11535], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/song_of_the_guns_1710_librivox/songoftheguns_01_frankau_64kb.mp3", "duration": 114}, {"section": 2, "title": "The Voice of the Slaves", "readers": [11535], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/song_of_the_guns_1710_librivox/songoftheguns_02_frankau_64kb.mp3", "duration": 41}, {"section": 3, "title": "Headquarters", "readers": [11535], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/song_of_the_guns_1710_librivox/songoftheguns_03_frankau_64kb.mp3", "duration": 146}, {"section": 4, "title": "Gun-Teams", "readers": [11535], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/song_of_the_guns_1710_librivox/songoftheguns_04_frankau_64kb.mp3", "duration": 181}, {"section": 5, "title": "Eyes in the Air", "readers": [11535], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/song_of_the_guns_1710_librivox/songoftheguns_05_frankau_64kb.mp3", "duration": 216}, {"section": 6, "title": "Signals", "readers": [11535], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/song_of_the_guns_1710_librivox/songoftheguns_06_frankau_64kb.mp3", "duration": 162}, {"section": 7, "title": "The Observers", "readers": [11535], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/song_of_the_guns_1710_librivox/songoftheguns_07_frankau_64kb.mp3", "duration": 208}, {"section": 8, "title": "Ammunition Column", "readers": [11535], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/song_of_the_guns_1710_librivox/songoftheguns_08_frankau_64kb.mp3", "duration": 186}, {"section": 9, "title": "The Voice of the Guns", "readers": [11535], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/song_of_the_guns_1710_librivox/songoftheguns_09_frankau_64kb.mp3", "duration": 315}]}
