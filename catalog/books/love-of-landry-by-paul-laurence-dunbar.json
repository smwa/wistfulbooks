{"title": "Love of Landry", "description": "The Love of Landry is one of Dunbar's four novels, and one of three that are about white people. In this case, the story is about the recuperation of the sick Mildred Osborne, an Eastern aristocrat, at a ranch in Colorado. The central character is faced with very different social norms operating in a world with so few women. Though the novel lacks black characters, allusions to them and plot conflicts that center on the position of a man in American society prejudice is hinted at. Mildred Osborne's journey of self-discovery ends in her finding out who Landry really is and that he is worthy of her love.
