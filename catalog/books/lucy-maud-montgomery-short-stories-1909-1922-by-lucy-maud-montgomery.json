{"title": "Lucy Maud Montgomery Short Stories, 1909-1922", "description": "L.M. Montgomery was a Canadian author, best known for a series of novels that began with Anne of Green Gables, published in 1908. Once published, Anne of Green Gables was an immediate success. The central character, Anne, an orphaned girl, made Montgomery famous in her lifetime and gave her an international following. The first novel was followed by a series of sequels with Anne as the central character. Montgomery went on to publish 20 novels as well as 500 short stories and poems. Because many of the novels were set on Prince Edward Island in Canada, Canada and the Canadian province became literary landmarks.
