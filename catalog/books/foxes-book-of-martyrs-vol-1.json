{"title": "Foxe's Book of Martyrs Vol 1, A History of the Lives, Sufferings, and Triumphant Deaths of the Early Christian and the Protestant Martyrs", "description": "The Book of Martyrs, by John Foxe, is an English Protestant account of the persecutions of Protestants, many of whom had died for their beliefs within the decade immediately preceding its first publication. It was first published by John Day, in 1563. Lavishly illustrated with many woodcuts, it was the largest publishing project undertaken in Britain up to that time. Commonly known as, \u201cFoxe\u2019s Book of Martyrs\u201d, the work\u2019s full title begins with \u201cActes and Monuments of these Latter and Perillous Days, Touching Matters of the Church.\u201d There were many subsequent editions, by Day, and by other editors down through the years. Foxe\u2019s original work was enormous (the second edition filling two heavy folio volumes with a total of 2,300 pages, estimated to be twice as long as Edward Gibbon\u2019s \u201cDecline and Fall of the Roman Empire.\u201d This edition is much abridged from Foxe\u2019s original.
