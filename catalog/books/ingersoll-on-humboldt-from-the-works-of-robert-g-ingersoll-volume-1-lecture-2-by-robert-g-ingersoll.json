{"title": "Ingersoll on HUMBOLDT, from the Works of Robert G. Ingersoll, Volume 1, Lecture 2", "description": "Col. Ingersoll begins his lectures on famous people as follows: \"It is hard to overstate the debt we owe to the men and women of genius. Take from our world what they have given, and all the niches would be empty, all the walls naked\u2014meaning and connection would fall from words of poetry and fiction, music would go back to common air, and all the forms of subtle and enchanting Art would lose proportion and become the unmeaning waste and shattered spoil of thoughtless Chance.\" One of the most famous orators of his day, a contemporary and personal friend of Mark Twain and General Grant, Ingersoll's lectures in this series include: SHAKESPEARE, ROBERT BURNS, ABRAHAM LINCOLN, VOLTAIRE, WALT WHITMAN, HUMBOLDT and THOMAS PAINE; followed by inspiring speeches on other personalities: THE GREAT INFIDELS; WHICH WAY? (science or superstition); and ABOUT THE HOLY BIBLE. \nEach lecture in Volume 3, plus 2 lectures from Volume 1 (of the 12 volume Dresden Edition), will be presented on Librivox as a separate audiobook in the series called Ingersoll Lectures, Famous People.
