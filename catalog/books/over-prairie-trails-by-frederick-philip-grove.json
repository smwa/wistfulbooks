{"title": "Over Prairie Trails", "description": "When Frederick Philip Grove settled in a remote area of Manitoba in the early years of the 20th century, he found work teaching in a school over 30 miles from his home. He commuted by horse-and-wagon or horse-and-sleigh each weekend, and seven of those long and challenging journeys are recorded in \u201cOver Prairie Trails,\u201d published in 1922.<br>\r\n\r\nGrove has a sharp eye for details of nature that were of life-and-death importance to the lone prairie traveller \u2014 the shifting aspects of skies, wind, fog, and snow. On one level, the book is a treasury of documentary observation and nature writing. <br>\r\n\r\nHowever, while Grove claims to offer a naturalist\u2019s \u201cplain truth,\u201d we come to realize that he is creating a \u201ctale\u201d as much as a nature diary. He selects and arranges his material. Sometimes this means transforming his accounts into archetypal heroic journeys, casting himself as the Odyssean adventurer who battles his way through seas of snow and fog to return to his wife and child. At other times, his reports launch meditations on the nature of observation, consciousness, and the construction of meaning.<br>\r\n\r\n\u201cOver Prairie Trails\u201d is a landmark in Canadian writing, influencing the way nature \u2014 especially the Canadian winter\u2014 would be written about for decades to come.
