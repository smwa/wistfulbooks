{"title": "What Prohibition Has Done to America", "description": "In <i>What Prohibition Has Done to America</i>, Fabian Franklin presents a concise but forceful argument against the Eighteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.  Beginning in 1920, this Amendment prohibited the sale and manufacture of alcoholic beverages in the United States, until it was repealed in 1933.  Franklin contends that the Amendment \"is not only a crime against the Constitution of the United States, and not only a crime against the whole spirit of our Federal system, but a crime against the first principles of rational government.\"  Writing only two years after Prohibition began, he correctly predicts many of its disastrous consequences, such as runaway bootlegging and organized crime.  The book is both a passionate defense of liberty, and a reminder to Americans of the perils of surrendering it.
