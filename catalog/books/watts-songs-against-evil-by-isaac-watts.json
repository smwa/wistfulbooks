{"title": "Watt's Songs Against Evil", "description": "This small volume of inspirational verse is a collection of the timeless work of the hymnist and theologian, Isaac Watts. Carefully and tactfully conceived, each of these motivational poems contains a valuable lesson relevant to youth's quest for moral guidance in a world of uncertainties and unknowns. \n\nBut lest these poems be construed as pedantic lectures demanding righteous behavior, the listener will be pleased to discover instead a series of uplifting narratives intended not to admonish but to advise, not to reprimand but to recommend. These are poems that compel one to consider choosing a life journey along a path of personal happiness and self-fulfillment. They are poems that offer life-changing guidance to those with a thirst for understanding and a hunger for wisdom. \n - Summary by Bruce Kachuk", "duration": 724, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "194", "name": "Isaac Watts"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/wattssongsagainstevil_2011_librivox/watts_songs_evil_2011.jpg", "copyright_year": "0", "genres": ["Poetry"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Bruce Kachuk"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Bruce Kachuk"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Devorah Allen"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Rapunzelina"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Against Pride in Clothes", "readers": [8786], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/wattssongsagainstevil_2011_librivox/wattssongsagainstevil_1_watts_64kb.mp3", "duration": 134}, {"section": 2, "title": "The Sluggard", "readers": [8786], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/wattssongsagainstevil_2011_librivox/wattssongsagainstevil_2_watts_64kb.mp3", "duration": 107}, {"section": 3, "title": "The Ant, or Emmet", "readers": [8786], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/wattssongsagainstevil_2011_librivox/wattssongsagainstevil_3_watts_64kb.mp3", "duration": 115}, {"section": 4, "title": "Innocent Play", "readers": [8786], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/wattssongsagainstevil_2011_librivox/wattssongsagainstevil_4_watts_64kb.mp3", "duration": 92}, {"section": 5, "title": "Against Evil Company", "readers": [8786], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/wattssongsagainstevil_2011_librivox/wattssongsagainstevil_5_watts_64kb.mp3", "duration": 89}, {"section": 6, "title": "The Thief", "readers": [8786], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/wattssongsagainstevil_2011_librivox/wattssongsagainstevil_6_watts_64kb.mp3", "duration": 96}, {"section": 7, "title": "The Rose", "readers": [8786], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/wattssongsagainstevil_2011_librivox/wattssongsagainstevil_7_watts_64kb.mp3", "duration": 91}]}
