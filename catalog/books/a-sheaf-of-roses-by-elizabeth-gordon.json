{"title": "Sheaf of Roses", "description": "The rose, the flower of love, the flower of life, the floral symbol of all life's occasions whose presence both motivates and adorns indelible life memories is the subject of these wonderful poems. From the pen of poet Elizabeth Gordon the rose becomes an integral component of life as she shares tales embodying the poignancy of our existence, the pathos of our being - thorns and prickles not excluded. These wonderful poems are uplifting, inspirational and remarkably filled with facets of a life we all share while being accompanied by the comforting and beautiful presence of this heartening heavenly floral offering, the rose.  - Summary by Bruce Kachuk", "duration": 545, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "14600", "name": "Elizabeth Gordon"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/sheafofroses_1912_librivox/sheafofroses_1912.jpg", "copyright_year": "1915", "genres": ["Single author"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Bruce Kachuk"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Bruce Kachuk"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Rapunzelina"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "SaraHale"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Dedication", "readers": [8786], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/sheafofroses_1912_librivox/sheafofroses_0_gordon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 34}, {"section": 1, "title": "Poems 1 - 8", "readers": [8786], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/sheafofroses_1912_librivox/sheafofroses_1_gordon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 248}, {"section": 2, "title": "Poems 9 - 17", "readers": [8786], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/sheafofroses_1912_librivox/sheafofroses_2_gordon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 263}]}
