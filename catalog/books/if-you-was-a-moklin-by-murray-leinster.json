{"title": "If You Was a Moklin", "description": "Moklins are the friendliest aliens humans ever encountered. They LOVE humans, and want to imitate them in every way they can.  And evolution on Moklin is very helpful in this regard.   After 40 years on Moklin, the only humans on the planet enjoy the friendship of these helpful 'people'.  There might be one little problem though.  Just a tiny thing that will cause the humans to leave in a very big hurry.  Not that it will do any good of course.    - Summary by phil chenevert", "duration": 3141, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "479", "name": "Murray Leinster"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/if_you_was_a_moklin_2302_librivox/moklin_2302.jpg", "genres": ["Science Fiction"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Christine Rottger"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Part 1", "readers": [5717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/if_you_was_a_moklin_2302_librivox/ifyouwasamoklin_01_leinster_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1425}, {"section": 2, "title": "Part 2", "readers": [5717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/if_you_was_a_moklin_2302_librivox/ifyouwasamoklin_02_leinster_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1716}]}
