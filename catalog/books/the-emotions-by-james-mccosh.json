{"title": "Emotions", "description": "I am not satisfied with the account which has been given of the feelings and emotions in our books of mental science, and thence transferred into the common thought and literature of modern times. In this work I treat of the emotions as psychical acts, but I do not overlook their physiological concomitants and effects. I enter little into controversy. My aim has been to expound the truth, and leave it to shine in its own light. - Summary by Adapted from Preface", "duration": 30144, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "18183", "name": "James McCosh"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/theemotions_2406_librivox/theemotions_2406.jpg", "copyright_year": "1880", "genres": ["*Non-fiction", "Psychology"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "InTheDesert"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Christine Rottger"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Cbteddy"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Introduction", "readers": [18843], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/theemotions_2406_librivox/theemotions_01_mccosh_64kb.mp3", "duration": 427}, {"section": 2, "title": "First Element: Appetences Part 1", "readers": [10611], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/theemotions_2406_librivox/theemotions_02_mccosh_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1731}, {"section": 3, "title": "First Element: Appetences Part 2", "readers": [10611], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/theemotions_2406_librivox/theemotions_03_mccosh_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1333}, {"section": 4, "title": "First Element: Appetences Part 3", "readers": [19303], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/theemotions_2406_librivox/theemotions_04_mccosh_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1021}, {"section": 5, "title": "Second Element: the Idea (Phantasm) Part 1", "readers": [19261], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/theemotions_2406_librivox/theemotions_05_mccosh_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1357}, {"section": 6, "title": "Second Element: the Idea (Phantasm) Part 2", "readers": [19091], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/theemotions_2406_librivox/theemotions_06_mccosh_64kb.mp3", "duration": 885}, {"section": 7, "title": "Second Element: the Idea (Phantasm) Part 3", "readers": [19372], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/theemotions_2406_librivox/theemotions_07_mccosh_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1989}, {"section": 8, "title": "Third Element: Excitement with Attachment and Repugnance", "readers": [19153], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/theemotions_2406_librivox/theemotions_08_mccosh_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1414}, {"section": 9, "title": "Fourth Element: the Organic Affection Part 1", "readers": [19303], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/theemotions_2406_librivox/theemotions_09_mccosh_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1398}, {"section": 10, "title": "Fourth Element: the Organic Affection Part 2", "readers": [19303], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/theemotions_2406_librivox/theemotions_10_mccosh_64kb.mp3", "duration": 848}, {"section": 11, "title": "Division of the Emotion", "readers": [19279], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/theemotions_2406_librivox/theemotions_11_mccosh_64kb.mp3", "duration": 541}, {"section": 12, "title": "Emotions as Directed to Animate Objects Part 1", "readers": [19314], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/theemotions_2406_librivox/theemotions_12_mccosh_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1342}, {"section": 13, "title": "Emotions as Directed to Animate Objects Part 2", "readers": [19343], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/theemotions_2406_librivox/theemotions_13_mccosh_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1776}, {"section": 14, "title": "Emotions as Directed to Animate Objects Part 3", "readers": [18946], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/theemotions_2406_librivox/theemotions_14_mccosh_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1369}, {"section": 15, "title": "Emotions Called Forth by Inanimate Objects.
