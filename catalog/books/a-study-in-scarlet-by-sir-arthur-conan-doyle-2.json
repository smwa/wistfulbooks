{"title": "Study in Scarlet (version 2)", "description": "A Study in Scarlet is a detective mystery novel written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, which was first published in 1887. It is the first story to feature the character of Sherlock Holmes, who would later become one of the most famous literary detective characters, with long-lasting interest and appeal. The book's title derives from a speech given by Holmes to his companion Doctor Watson on the nature of his work, in which he describes the story's murder investigation as his \"study in scarlet\": \"There\u2019s the scarlet thread of murder running through the colourless skein of life, and our duty is to unravel it, and isolate it, and expose every inch of it.\" (Summary from Wikipedia)", "duration": 15416, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "467", "name": "Sir Arthur Conan Doyle"}], "coverArt": "http://archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt22/Study_Scarlet_V2_1210.jpg", "copyright_year": "1887", "genres": ["Detective Fiction"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Leni"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Leni"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Stav Nisser"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "01 Part 1, Chapter 1.
