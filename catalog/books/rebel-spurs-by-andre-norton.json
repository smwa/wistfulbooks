{"title": "Rebel Spurs", "description": "In 1866, only men uprooted by war had reason to ride into Tubacca, Arizona, a nondescript town as shattered and anonymous as the veterans drifting through it. So when Drew Rennie, newly discharged from Forrest\u2019s Confederate scouts, arrived leading everything he owned behind him\u2014his thoroughbred stud Shiloh, a mare about to foal, and a mule\u2014he knew his business would not be questioned. To anyone in Tubacca there could be only one extraordinary thing about Drew, and that he could not reveal: his name, Rennie.<br /><br />\n\nDrew had come west from Kentucky to find a father he had thought dead until the year before. Kinship with a man like Hunt Rennie, however\u2014the legendary Don Cazar, owner of a matchless range and prize stallions\u2014was not a claim to be made quickly or lightly. Posing as Drew Kirby the young veteran contrived to get himself and his friend Anse hired as corral hands at Rennie\u2019s Range, but he was hardly prepared for the suspicion and danger which stood between him and his father. As hotheaded as his father, Drew was ready to move on to California\u2014until the day all proof of his Rennie name was stolen from him, and his unwarranted arrest for horse-thieving brought on the accusations of the one man whose trust he needed.<br /><br />\n\nAndre Norton\u2019s _Ride Proud, Rebel!_ dramatically portrayed the last year of the Confederacy, when brave men like Drew Rennie met defeat with honor. In this sequel, Drew\u2019s struggle to establish his identity and begin life anew in a raw, unsettled land reflects the courage of thousands of rootless men set adrift by the Civil War.<br />\n - Summary by Front Dust Jacket", "duration": 24291, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "358", "name": "Andre Norton"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt33/rebelspurs_1401.jpg", "copyright_year": "1962", "genres": ["Action & Adventure Fiction", "Westerns"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Richard Kilmer"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Richard Kilmer"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Barry Eads"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "mim@can (1949-2017)"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Chapter 1", "readers": [4078], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/rebel_spurs_1401_librivox/rebelspurs_01_norton_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1586}, {"section": 2, "title": "Chapter 2", "readers": [4078], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/rebel_spurs_1401_librivox/rebelspurs_02_norton_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1334}, {"section": 3, "title": "Chapter 3", "readers": [4078], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/rebel_spurs_1401_librivox/rebelspurs_03_norton_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1345}, {"section": 4, "title": "Chapter 4", "readers": [4078], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/rebel_spurs_1401_librivox/rebelspurs_04_norton_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1290}, {"section": 5, "title": "Chapter 5", "readers": [4078], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/rebel_spurs_1401_librivox/rebelspurs_05_norton_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1323}, {"section": 6, "title": "Chapter 6", "readers": [4078], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/rebel_spurs_1401_librivox/rebelspurs_06_norton_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1360}, {"section": 7, "title": "Chapter 7", "readers": [4078], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/rebel_spurs_1401_librivox/rebelspurs_07_norton_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1392}, {"section": 8, "title": "Chapter 8", "readers": [4078], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/rebel_spurs_1401_librivox/rebelspurs_08_norton_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1319}, {"section": 9, "title": "Chapter 9", "readers": [4078], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/rebel_spurs_1401_librivox/rebelspurs_09_norton_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1280}, {"section": 10, "title": "Chapter 10", "readers": [4078], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/rebel_spurs_1401_librivox/rebelspurs_10_norton_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1359}, {"section": 11, "title": "Chapter 11", "readers": [4078], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/rebel_spurs_1401_librivox/rebelspurs_11_norton_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1309}, {"section": 12, "title": "Chapter 12", "readers": [4078], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/rebel_spurs_1401_librivox/rebelspurs_12_norton_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1458}, {"section": 13, "title": "Chapter 13", "readers": [4078], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/rebel_spurs_1401_librivox/rebelspurs_13_norton_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1257}, {"section": 14, "title": "Chapter 14", "readers": [4078], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/rebel_spurs_1401_librivox/rebelspurs_14_norton_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1332}, {"section": 15, "title": "Chapter 15", "readers": [4078], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/rebel_spurs_1401_librivox/rebelspurs_15_norton_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1338}, {"section": 16, "title": "Chapter 16", "readers": [4078], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/rebel_spurs_1401_librivox/rebelspurs_16_norton_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1226}, {"section": 17, "title": "Chapter 17", "readers": [4078], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/rebel_spurs_1401_librivox/rebelspurs_17_norton_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1278}, {"section": 18, "title": "Chapter 18", "readers": [4078], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/rebel_spurs_1401_librivox/rebelspurs_18_norton_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1505}]}
