{"title": "Ingersoll on The HOLY BIBLE, from the Works of Robert G. Ingersoll, Volume 3, Lecture 9", "description": "Ingersoll is known as \"the greatest infidel\" of the 19th century. Steeped in religion as a child by his Baptist preacher father, he eventually came to rail against the hypocricy, judgment, hatred and fear he observed in his fellow Christians, and their attempt to restrict free thought and human liberty. He begins this lecture: SOMEBODY ought to tell the truth about the Bible. The preachers dare not, because they would be driven from their pulpits. Professors in colleges dare not, because they would lose their salaries. Politicians dare not. They would be defeated. Editors dare not. They would lose subscribers. Merchants dare not, because they might lose customers. Men of fashion dare not, fearing that they would lose caste. Even clerks dare not, because they might be discharged. And so I thought I would do it myself. (~summary by Michele Fry) ", "duration": 5775, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "4371", "name": " Robert G.
