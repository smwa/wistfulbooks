{"title": "Yellowstone National Park:  Six Early Pieces", "description": "Lost in the wilderness of The Yellowstone for over a month, nearly dying of starvation and wild animal attack, despairing of ever finding his way out.    Here are six relatively unknown early pieces about the U.S.A.\u2019s first national park.   The first is a U.S. Geological booklet about initial exploration and Congress\u2019s institution of the park.  The next two are articles from Scribner\u2019s Monthly, 1871, a very popular magazine of the time, describing the park\u2019s features (vol 2 #1  pp 1-17 and vol 2 #2 pp 113-128) .  The fourth piece is a narrative by the leader of the exploratory expedition described in the first piece, H.V. Hayden (Scribner\u2019s Monthly, vol 3#2 pp 388-396, February 1872)  The fifth piece is a lecture on the park by a very popular lecturer and writer, 1900 (John L. Stoddard\u2019s Lectures, vol 10).  The last piece is a man\u2019s first-person narrative of his being  lost in the Yellowstone wilderness for thirty-seven days, 1871, Scribner\u2019s Monthly again (vol 3#1). - Summary by david wales", "duration": 18909, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "18", "name": " Various"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/yellowstone6pieces_1502_librivox/yellowstone_national_park_1502.jpg", "copyright_year": "1868", "genres": ["Essays & Short Works", "Exploration"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "David Wales"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "David Wales"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "J.
