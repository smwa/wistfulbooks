{"title": "Saved and Kept: or How to Get Saved and How to Keep Saved", "description": "     This little volume is by no means intended to be a theological work. Nor does it attempt to show the details of the Christian life. The author seeks to point out the principal means by which sincere souls may be saved and keep saved. It is intended to be a simple, direct exposition of the way of salvation, put in every-day language, with the earnest desire that \u2018\u2018he that runneth may read,\"\u2019 and that the reader may be helped in reaching the goal, and in finding an abundant entrance into the City of God. \n     With this single aim we launch this little book, praying that it may be helpful to some soul who seeks to know what God has for him.  - Summary by G.
