{"title": "Miss Priscilla Hunter, and My Daughter Susan", "description": "Two shorter stories in one book. In \"Miss Priscilla Hunter,\" the church has been carrying debt for years. It's an embarrassment, and it is hindering them from doing necessary work. They've tried to chip away at it in the past with festivals and fundraisers, but it seems like it will never go away. Miss Hunter, a poor seamstress, finally takes matters into her own hands and works to KILL that debt once and for all! In \"My Daughter Susan,\" we tag along with Susan in what is apparently a typical day for her, seeing how she works for others and her Lord, within the context of temperance.
