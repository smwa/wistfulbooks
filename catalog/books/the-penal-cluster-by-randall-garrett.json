{"title": "Penal Cluster", "description": "What do you do with telepaths?  Chain them to an asteroid of course and just leave them there ..... but why?  Wait a minute ... did I just say that the punishment for being a telepath in the future earth was to be chained to an asteroid 50 million miles from earth and then leave them there, comatose, to spin forever in their lonely orbits?   Well, yes, that is what earth's draconian solution was to the sudden emergence of telepath ability.  The world wide psychodeviant police had the job of tracking down these terrible deviants and then sending them into space immediately.  But are all telepaths evil?  Could one of these psychodeviant police be  secret telepath himself?  Listen to this great story and find out why earth felt so terrified of telepaths.   - Summary by philip a chenevert", "duration": 7754, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "6276", "name": "Randall Garrett"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/thepenalcluster_1605_librivox/penal_cluster_1606.jpg", "copyright_year": "0", "genres": ["Science Fiction"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "DaveC"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Part 1", "readers": [5717], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/thepenalcluster_1605_librivox/thepenalcluster_01_garrett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2175}, {"section": 2, "title": "Part 2", "readers": [5717], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/thepenalcluster_1605_librivox/thepenalcluster_02_garrett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1988}, {"section": 3, "title": "Part 3", "readers": [5717], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/thepenalcluster_1605_librivox/thepenalcluster_03_garrett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1744}, {"section": 4, "title": "Part 4", "readers": [5717], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/thepenalcluster_1605_librivox/thepenalcluster_04_garrett_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1847}]}
