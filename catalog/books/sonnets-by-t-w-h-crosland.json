{"title": "Sonnets", "description": "This inspiring collection of sonnets from British author T.W.H. Crosland displays the creativity, keen powers of observation and the unsurpassed interpretive skills of a superb poet and student of human nature.\r\n<br><br>\r\nWe hear in this varied compilation the assertions of a man both fascinated and perplexed by disparate social events that surround him. A man eager to scrutinize, note, and with a gift for poetic expression, put pen to paper in articulating his thoughts in words not only of majestic beauty but which portray the compassionate, humanitarian sentiments he possesses, sentiments which forever face the possibility of being buried beneath the minutiae of a mundane world. \r\n<br><br>\r\nIn addition to keen observational powers of life around him, Crosland augments his work with thoughts that reflect an overwhelming insight into a world that is yet to be, one of shared destiny, of nemesis. One prominent unavoidable factor is death itself, and it is death whose lesson of \"A cry, a rose, and - dust\" governs the journey toward such \"dust\" of those travelers among us whose, \"chill pomps and aching triumphs are won.\"\r\n<br><br>\r\nBut the compelling factor that sets Crosland apart among poets is his empathy, his compassion for the common man and his realization that mankind's individual, at the time seemingly enormous contribution to a profound and unshakable overall scheme is forever condemned to play a miniscule role, \"For our high souls are mirrors of Himself, / Though our great wonders are His littlest things.\"<br>\r\n - Summary by Bruce Kachuk<br>", "duration": 1563, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "2698", "name": "T.
