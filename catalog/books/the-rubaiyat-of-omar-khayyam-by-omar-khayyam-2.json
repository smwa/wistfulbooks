{"title": "Rub\u00e1iy\u00e1t of Omar Khayy\u00e1m (Fitzgerald 5th edition)", "description": "The Rub\u00e1iy\u00e1t of Omar Khayy\u00e1m is so-named from the Persian word rub\u00e1iy\u00e1t - a Persian word denoting a specific type of two-line stanza. Omar's Rubaiyat is a beautiful anthology of Islamic wisdom literature: originally penned in medieval Persian during the late 11th century AD. <br /><br />\n\nThe best known English translations are those by Edward Fitzgerald: his fifth (and last) translation includes a mere 101 quatrains - a fraction of Omar's original work. Fitzgerald's selection loosely groups quatrains by theme; rendering quatrains into English as four-line, rhymed stanzas.<br /><br />\n\nOmar's writings are pervaded by the consciousness of the transient quality of life. In his Rub\u00e1iy\u00e1t, the author ponders the limits of human knowledge and morality: and confronts his readers point-blank with the difficult questions that challenge every generation: \n<br /><br />\n- what is the ultimate benefit derived from human knowledge? <br/>\n- given human mortality; is is best to guide our lives by the dictates of reason, or sensuality? <br/>\n- what happens to my soul when I die? <br/>\n- why did God - the Creator - give me existence? \n<br/>\n(Introduction by Godsend)", "duration": 2254, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "1299", "name": "Omar Khayy\u00e1m"}], "coverArt": "http://www.archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCovers3/rubaiyatofomarkhayyam_1009.jpg", "copyright_year": "1889", "genres": ["Poetry"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Nathan"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Nathan"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Nadine Eckert-Boulet"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Betty M."}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Quatrains 1-20", "readers": [3793], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/rubaiyat_edition5_1009_n_librivox/rubaiyatofomarkhayyam_1_khayyam_64kb.mp3", "duration": 450}, {"section": 2, "title": "Quatrains 21-40", "readers": [3793], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/rubaiyat_edition5_1009_n_librivox/rubaiyatofomarkhayyam_2_khayyam_64kb.mp3", "duration": 441}, {"section": 3, "title": "Quatrains 41-60", "readers": [3793], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/rubaiyat_edition5_1009_n_librivox/rubaiyatofomarkhayyam_3_khayyam_64kb.mp3", "duration": 439}, {"section": 4, "title": "Quatrains 61-80", "readers": [3793], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/rubaiyat_edition5_1009_n_librivox/rubaiyatofomarkhayyam_4_khayyam_64kb.mp3", "duration": 452}, {"section": 5, "title": "Quatrains 81-101", "readers": [3793], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/rubaiyat_edition5_1009_n_librivox/rubaiyatofomarkhayyam_5_khayyam_64kb.mp3", "duration": 472}]}
