{"title": "Drug Themes in Science Fiction", "description": "Science fiction is more often a reflection of existing societal trends than a prediction of trends to come. The upsurge in drug use is precisely mirrored by the upsurge in the use of such themes in science fiction. Science fiction is as much a guide to where we are as it is a vision of where we are going.  A literature so popular with the young, commanding so intense and devoted a following, can be of significant value in revealing the patterns contemporary society is taking and will take in the years just ahead. - Summary by Robert Silverberg, from Introduction", "duration": 5391, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "48", "name": "Robert Silverberg"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/drugthemessciencefiction_2403_librivox/drug_themes_2403.jpg", "copyright_year": "1975", "genres": ["Reference"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Ben Tucker"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Ben Tucker"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Ann Boulais"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Verla Viera"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Forward / Preface", "readers": [16758], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/drugthemessciencefiction_2403_librivox/drugthemesinscifi_00_silverberg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 459}, {"section": 1, "title": "Overview of Drug Themes in Science Fiction", "readers": [16758], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/drugthemessciencefiction_2403_librivox/drugthemesinscifi_01_silverberg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1140}, {"section": 2, "title": "Annotated Bibliography: Primitive Period, c. 1900-1935", "readers": [16758], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/drugthemessciencefiction_2403_librivox/drugthemesinscifi_02_silverberg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 440}, {"section": 3, "title": "Annotated Bibliography: Predictive Period, c. 1935-1965", "readers": [16758], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/drugthemessciencefiction_2403_librivox/drugthemesinscifi_03_silverberg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1350}, {"section": 4, "title": "Annotated Bibliography: Contemporary Period, c. 1965-1973", "readers": [16758], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/drugthemessciencefiction_2403_librivox/drugthemesinscifi_04_silverberg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2002}]}
