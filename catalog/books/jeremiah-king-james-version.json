{"title": "Bible (KJV) 24: Jeremiah", "description": "The Book of Jeremiah is the second of the Latter Prophets in the Hebrew Bible, following the book of Isaiah and preceding Ezekiel and the Book of the Twelve. (The order is somewhat different in the Christian Old Testament). It derives its name from, and records the visions of, Jeremiah, who lived in Jerusalem in the late 7th and early 6th centuries BCE during the time of king Josiah and the fall of the Kingdom of Judah to the Babylonians. <br/><br/>The book can be divided into roughly 6 sections and uses poetic, narrative, and biographical genres that are interspersed throughout the book. The breakdown of sections is as follows:<br/>Chapters 1-25 (The earliest and main core of Jeremiah's message)<br/>Chapters 26-29 (Biographic material and interaction with other prophets)<br/>Chapters 30-33 (God's promise of restoration)<br/>Chapters 34-45 (Mostly interaction with Zedekiah and the fall of Jerusalem)<br/>Chapters 46-51 (Divine punishment to the nations surrounding Israel)<br/>Chapter 52 (Appendix that retells 2 Kings 24:18-25:30)<br/>(Summary by Wikipedia)", "duration": 17152, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "950", "name": " King James Version (KJV)"}], "coverArt": "http://www.archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt16/jeremiah_kjv_1205.jpg", "copyright_year": "1611", "genres": ["Bibles", "King James Version"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "TriciaG"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "TriciaG"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "lomond"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "01 - Chapters 1-4", "readers": [6295], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/jeremiah_kjv_1201_librivox/jeremiah_01_kjv_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1508}, {"section": 2, "title": "02 - Chapters 5-7", "readers": [6660], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/jeremiah_kjv_1201_librivox/jeremiah_02_kjv_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1054}, {"section": 3, "title": "03 - Chapters 8-11", "readers": [6660], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/jeremiah_kjv_1201_librivox/jeremiah_03_kjv_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1162}, {"section": 4, "title": "04 - Chapters 12-15", "readers": [6660], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/jeremiah_kjv_1201_librivox/jeremiah_04_kjv_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1187}, {"section": 5, "title": "05 - Chapters 16-19", "readers": [6406], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/jeremiah_kjv_1201_librivox/jeremiah_05_kjv_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1064}, {"section": 6, "title": "06 - Chapters 20-23", "readers": [6512], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/jeremiah_kjv_1201_librivox/jeremiah_06_kjv_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1263}, {"section": 7, "title": "07 - Chapters 24-27", "readers": [6660], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/jeremiah_kjv_1201_librivox/jeremiah_07_kjv_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1236}, {"section": 8, "title": "08 - Chapters 28-30", "readers": [6406], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/jeremiah_kjv_1201_librivox/jeremiah_08_kjv_64kb.mp3", "duration": 829}, {"section": 9, "title": "09 - Chapters 31-32", "readers": [6406], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/jeremiah_kjv_1201_librivox/jeremiah_09_kjv_64kb.mp3", "duration": 989}, {"section": 10, "title": "10 - Chapters 33-35", "readers": [6060], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/jeremiah_kjv_1201_librivox/jeremiah_10_kjv_64kb.mp3", "duration": 818}, {"section": 11, "title": "11 - Chapters 36-38", "readers": [6060], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/jeremiah_kjv_1201_librivox/jeremiah_11_kjv_64kb.mp3", "duration": 973}, {"section": 12, "title": "12 - Chapters 39-42", "readers": [3157], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/jeremiah_kjv_1201_librivox/jeremiah_12_kjv_64kb.mp3", "duration": 982}, {"section": 13, "title": "13 - Chapters 43-45", "readers": [3157], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/jeremiah_kjv_1201_librivox/jeremiah_13_kjv_64kb.mp3", "duration": 682}, {"section": 14, "title": "14 - Chapters 46-48", "readers": [6295], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/jeremiah_kjv_1201_librivox/jeremiah_14_kjv_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1001}, {"section": 15, "title": "15 - Chapters 49-50", "readers": [6295], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/jeremiah_kjv_1201_librivox/jeremiah_15_kjv_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1159}, {"section": 16, "title": "16 - Chapters 51-52", "readers": [6295], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/jeremiah_kjv_1201_librivox/jeremiah_16_kjv_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1245}]}
