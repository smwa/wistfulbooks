{"title": "Idea of Progress: An Inquiry into Its Origin and Growth", "description": "John Bagnell Bury was Regius Professor of Modern History at Cambridge University in the early twentieth century. In The Idea of Progress, he assesses the concepts of history found in the classical period and then traces the historical development of the concept of political and social progress by looking at writers from the sixteenth to the nineteenth century. It is interesting to consider what the history of the past hundred years would add to such an analysis. - Summary by Barry Ganong", "duration": 32369, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "605", "name": "John Bagnell Bury"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/ideaofprogress_2012_librivox/ideaprogress_2101.jpg", "copyright_year": "1920", "genres": ["History", "Social Science (Culture & Anthropology)", "Early Modern"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Barry Ganong"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Barry Ganong"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "J.
