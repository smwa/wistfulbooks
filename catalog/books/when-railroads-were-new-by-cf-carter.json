{"title": "When Railroads Were New", "description": "This history of American railroads originated as a series of articles in Railroad Man's Magazine before being compiled into a book in 1909. With enough technical depth to engage railroad professionals, along with a lively and engaging style to appeal a wider audience, the author relies heavily on vivid anecdotes to depict the drama of early railroad experiments. Through these vibrant stories, the book traces the growth of railroads during the latter half of the 19th century, demonstrating how they transformed into the largest and most advanced business enterprises of the era. -
