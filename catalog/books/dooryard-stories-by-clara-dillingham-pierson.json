{"title": "Dooryard Stories", "description": "A collections of stories about the animals around our houses, the birds, the cats, and even the bugs! Written in a humorous and very interesting style, the animals sound almost human, and you can learn along with them. You'll learn what happens to a hog caterpillar when he does not take advice, how a a young bird took a nasty fall because he didn't obey his parents, and how happy it made some robins when they helped their parents care for their younger siblings that came so close behind the first ones. Lots of other stories too about the animal's lives, make you realize that the animals in your dooryard may be more interesting than you think!
