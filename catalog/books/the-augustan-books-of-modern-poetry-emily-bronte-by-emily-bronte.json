{"title": "Augustan Books of Modern Poetry: Emily Bront\u00eb", "description": "The inspirational and visionary poetry of Emily Bront\u00eb will live forever in the annals of great works of creative art. Renowned as the author of the novel \"Wuthering Heights\", the mystically contemplative poems of Bront\u00eb are featured in this superb collection of some of her best work. These are universally appealing poems that actively examine each and everyone's place in this life of love, loss and wonderment - the wonderment of millions of magical souls on a journey whose terminus remains obscure. Bront\u00eb writes of life and exhibits a prescient insight into a mystical universal life form - be it one of a new beginning, a replication, or a heuristic recap of a past long beyond the point of alteration. \r\n<br><br>\r\nWe are most fortunate to be able to share the insight of this magnificent poet as she examines the machinations of the collective lived experience and the perception and wisdom of the nature of existence. And since the whim of an ill wind terminated too soon this brilliant soul's worldly reality, we are privileged to be able to learn of her sentiments, her hopes, her disappointments and her innermost feelings in these superb poems of a poet at the peak of prophetic ability and writing prowess. \r\n<br><br>\r\nYet despite the dire conditions of the life that surrounded her, despite the illness, disappointment and death that was the lived reality of Emily Bront\u00eb, she maintained her faith and hope that good will indeed triumph over a seemingly bleak present. In the words of the poet, \"I shall sing when night's decay / Ushers in the drearier day.\"<br>\r\n - Summary by Bruce Kachuk", "duration": 2864, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "2072", "name": "Emily Bront\u00eb"}], "coverArt": null, "copyright_year": "1926", "genres": ["Single author"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Bruce Kachuk"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Bruce Kachuk"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Rapunzelina"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Rapunzelina"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Faith and Despondency", "readers": [8786], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/emilybronte_2312_librivox/emilybronte_01_bronte_64kb.mp3", "duration": 241}, {"section": 2, "title": "The Philosopher", "readers": [8786], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/emilybronte_2312_librivox/emilybronte_02_bronte_64kb.mp3", "duration": 204}, {"section": 3, "title": "Remembrance", "readers": [8786], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/emilybronte_2312_librivox/emilybronte_03_bronte_64kb.mp3", "duration": 159}, {"section": 4, "title": "The Outcast Mother", "readers": [8786], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/emilybronte_2312_librivox/emilybronte_04_bronte_64kb.mp3", "duration": 145}, {"section": 5, "title": "That Wind, I Used to Hear", "readers": [8786], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/emilybronte_2312_librivox/emilybronte_05_bronte_64kb.mp3", "duration": 50}, {"section": 6, "title": "There was a Time", "readers": [8786], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/emilybronte_2312_librivox/emilybronte_06_bronte_64kb.mp3", "duration": 74}, {"section": 7, "title": "The Night is Darkening", "readers": [8786], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/emilybronte_2312_librivox/emilybronte_07_bronte_64kb.mp3", "duration": 55}, {"section": 8, "title": "Fall, Leaves", "readers": [8786], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/emilybronte_2312_librivox/emilybronte_08_bronte_64kb.mp3", "duration": 47}, {"section": 9, "title": "Heaven's Glory Shone", "readers": [8786], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/emilybronte_2312_librivox/emilybronte_09_bronte_64kb.mp3", "duration": 39}, {"section": 10, "title": "Song", "readers": [8786], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/emilybronte_2312_librivox/emilybronte_10_bronte_64kb.mp3", "duration": 102}, {"section": 11, "title": "Tell Me, Smiling Child", "readers": [8786], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/emilybronte_2312_librivox/emilybronte_11_bronte_64kb.mp3", "duration": 100}, {"section": 12, "title": "The Prisoner", "readers": [8786], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/emilybronte_2312_librivox/emilybronte_12_bronte_64kb.mp3", "duration": 337}, {"section": 13, "title": "The Weary Task", "readers": [8786], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/emilybronte_2312_librivox/emilybronte_13_bronte_64kb.mp3", "duration": 167}, {"section": 14, "title": "Shall Earth no more Inspire Thee?", "readers": [8786], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/emilybronte_2312_librivox/emilybronte_14_bronte_64kb.mp3", "duration": 107}, {"section": 15, "title": "Plead for Me", "readers": [8786], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/emilybronte_2312_librivox/emilybronte_15_bronte_64kb.mp3", "duration": 158}, {"section": 16, "title": "Self-Interrogation", "readers": [8786], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/emilybronte_2312_librivox/emilybronte_16_bronte_64kb.mp3", "duration": 169}, {"section": 17, "title": "Stanzas To --", "readers": [8786], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/emilybronte_2312_librivox/emilybronte_17_bronte_64kb.mp3", "duration": 105}, {"section": 18, "title": "The Wanderer from the Fold", "readers": [8786], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/emilybronte_2312_librivox/emilybronte_18_bronte_64kb.mp3", "duration": 141}, {"section": 19, "title": "The Appeal", "readers": [8786], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/emilybronte_2312_librivox/emilybronte_19_bronte_64kb.mp3", "duration": 67}, {"section": 20, "title": "The Old Stoic", "readers": [8786], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/emilybronte_2312_librivox/emilybronte_20_bronte_64kb.mp3", "duration": 57}, {"section": 21, "title": "The Visionary", "readers": [8786], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/emilybronte_2312_librivox/emilybronte_21_bronte_64kb.mp3", "duration": 121}, {"section": 22, "title": "Stanzas", "readers": [8786], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/emilybronte_2312_librivox/emilybronte_22_bronte_64kb.mp3", "duration": 96}, {"section": 23, "title": "Last Lines", "readers": [8786], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/emilybronte_2312_librivox/emilybronte_23_bronte_64kb.mp3", "duration": 123}]}
