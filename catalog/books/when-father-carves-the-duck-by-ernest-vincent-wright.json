{"title": "When Father Carves the Duck", "description": "Ernest Vincent Wright was an American author known for his book Gadsby, a 50,000-word novel which, except for the introduction and a note at the end, did not use the letter \"e\".\nThe biographical details of his life are unclear. A 2002 article in the Village Voice by Ed Park said he might have been English by birth but was more probably American. The article said he might have served in the navy and that he has been incorrectly called a graduate of MIT. The article says that he attended a vocational high school attached to MIT in 1888 but there is no record that he graduated. Park said rumors that Wright died within hours of Gadsby being published are untrue. - Summary by Wikipedia", "duration": 1154, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "12422", "name": "Ernest Vincent Wright"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/when_father_carves_the_duck_1612.poem_librivox/father_duck_1612.jpg", "copyright_year": "1891", "genres": ["Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "When Father Carves the Duck - Read by BK", "readers": [8786], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/when_father_carves_the_duck_1612.poem_librivox/whenfather_wright_bk_64kb.mp3", "duration": 121}, {"section": 2, "title": "When Father Carves the Duck - Read by DL", "readers": [2911], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/when_father_carves_the_duck_1612.poem_librivox/whenfather_wright_dl_64kb.mp3", "duration": 101}, {"section": 3, "title": "When Father Carves the Duck - Read by GB", "readers": [4969], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/when_father_carves_the_duck_1612.poem_librivox/whenfather_wright_gb_64kb.mp3", "duration": 103}, {"section": 4, "title": "When Father Carves the Duck - Read by GG", "readers": [8011], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/when_father_carves_the_duck_1612.poem_librivox/whenfather_wright_gg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 130}, {"section": 5, "title": "When Father Carves the Duck - Read by IK", "readers": [7785], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/when_father_carves_the_duck_1612.poem_librivox/whenfather_wright_ik_64kb.mp3", "duration": 100}, {"section": 6, "title": "When Father Carves the Duck - Read by JH", "readers": [10205], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/when_father_carves_the_duck_1612.poem_librivox/whenfather_wright_jh_64kb.mp3", "duration": 119}, {"section": 7, "title": "When Father Carves the Duck - Read by LAH", "readers": [1212], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/when_father_carves_the_duck_1612.poem_librivox/whenfather_wright_lah_64kb.mp3", "duration": 98}, {"section": 8, "title": "When Father Carves the Duck - Read by LLW", "readers": [4738], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/when_father_carves_the_duck_1612.poem_librivox/whenfather_wright_llw_64kb.mp3", "duration": 100}, {"section": 9, "title": "When Father Carves the Duck - Read by MSD", "readers": [10891], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/when_father_carves_the_duck_1612.poem_librivox/whenfather_wright_msd_64kb.mp3", "duration": 98}, {"section": 10, "title": "When Father Carves the Duck - Read by TP", "readers": [10789], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/when_father_carves_the_duck_1612.poem_librivox/whenfather_wright_tp_64kb.mp3", "duration": 89}, {"section": 11, "title": "When Father Carves the Duck - Read by VB", "readers": [8169], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/when_father_carves_the_duck_1612.poem_librivox/whenfather_wright_vb_64kb.mp3", "duration": 95}]}
