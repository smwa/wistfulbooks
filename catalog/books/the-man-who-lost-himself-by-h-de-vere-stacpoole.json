De Vere Stacpoole\u2019s first publication was a book titled <i>The Intended</i> in 1894. Stacpoole was disappointed at its lack of commercial success, and felt the story was too good to let go. He eventually re-worked the book, culminating in <i>The Man Who Lost Himself</i>, a light-hearted story of a luckless American visiting London on yet another of his failed business ventures, when he happens upon a gentleman of status and wealth, who also just happens to be his exact look-alike.
