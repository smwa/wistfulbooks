{"title": "Secret of Father Brown", "description": "This is the fourth collection of mysteries featuring the very smart and even more devout catholic priest, Father Brown. (It follows <a href=\"https://librivox.org/the-innocence-of-father-brown-by-g-k-chesterton/\">The Innocence of Father Brown</a>, <a href=\"https://librivox.org/the-wisdom-of-father-brown-by-g-k-chesterton/\">The Wisdom of Father Brown</a> and <a href=\"https://librivox.org/the-incredulity-of-father-brown-by-g-k-chesterton-2/\">The Incredulity of Father Brown</a>.)<br><br>\r\n\r\nFather Brown is probably the most unconventional detective of fiction: short and dumpy, extremely shy, unvaryingly kind, and utterly unselfconscious.<br><br>\r\n\r\nHis secret? As a priest he has developed a far-reaching understanding of how we all feel and think. Being profoundly humble, he is able to imagine how he, personally, could be led to commit a given theft, murder or other crime. With this in mind, he is generally able to figure out who did commit it. - Summary by Kirsten Wever", "duration": 31689, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "426", "name": "G. K.
