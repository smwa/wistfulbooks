{"title": "Roswell Report: Case Closed", "description": "The \u201cRoswell Incident\u201d has assumed a central place in American folklore since the events of the 1940s in a remote area of New Mexico. In July 1994, the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force concluded an exhaustive search for records in response to a General Accounting Office (GAO) inquiry of an event popularly known as the \u201cRoswell Incident.\u201d The focus of the GAO probe...was to determine if the U.S. Air Force, or any other U.S. government agency, possessed information on the alleged crash and recovery of an extraterrestrial vehicle and its alien occupants near Roswell, N.M. in July 1947. Subsequent to the 1994 report, Air Force researchers discovered information that provided a rational explanation for the alleged observations of alien bodies associated with the \u201cRoswell Incident.\u201d This report discusses the results of this further research and identifies the likely sources of the claims of \u201calien\u201d bodies.  - Summary by James McAndrew ", "duration": 19133, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "15610", "name": "James McAndrew"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/roswellrpt_caseclosed_2102_librivox/roswellreport_2102.jpg", "copyright_year": "1997", "genres": ["War & Military"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Aaron Bennett"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Aaron Bennett"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "J.
