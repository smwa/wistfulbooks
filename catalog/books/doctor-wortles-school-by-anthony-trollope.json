{"title": "Doctor Wortle's School", "description": "Anthony Trollope\u2019s fortieth novel, published in 1881, concerns a respectable Christian boys\u2019 school whose proprietor unknowingly hires a woman who apparently has two husbands: a devoted English scholar and an abusive drunkard from the American South. The book interweaves a sensitive and realistic exploration of Dr. Wortle\u2019s moral dilemma with a humorous look at small-town gossip and--of course--a romance involving the doctor\u2019s beautiful young daughter.
