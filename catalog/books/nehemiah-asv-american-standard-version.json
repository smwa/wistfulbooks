{"title": "Bible (ASV) 16: Nehemiah", "description": "\"The Book of Nehemiah, sometimes called the Second Book of Ezra, is a book of the Hebrew Bible. It is historically regarded as a continuation of the Book of Ezra, and the two are frequently taken together as Ezra-Nehemiah. Traditionally, the author of this book is believed to be Nehemiah himself. The date at which the book was written was probably about 431 - 430 BC, when Nehemiah had returned the second time to Jerusalem after his visit to Persia. The book consists of four parts: (1) An account of the rebuilding of the wall of Jerusalem, and of the register Nehemiah had found of those who had returned from Babylon. Details describe how Nehemiah became governor of Judah; various forms of opposition generated by Sanballat and others; describes earlier return under Zerubbabel (ch. 1-7). (2) An account of the state of religion among the Jews during this time (8-10). (3) Increase of the inhabitants of Jerusalem; the census of the adult male population, and names of the chiefs, together with lists of priests and Levites (11-12:1-26).  4) Dedication of the wall of Jerusalem, the arrangement of the temple officers, and the reforms carried out by Nehemiah (12:27-ch. 13)\" (Summary by Wikipedia)", "duration": 3906, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "187", "name": " American Standard Version"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt21/Nehemiah_ASV_1209.jpg", "copyright_year": "1901", "genres": ["American Standard Version"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Sam Stinson"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Sam Stinson"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "TriciaG"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Ricky St. Claire"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "1 - Chapters 01-03", "readers": [908], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/nehemiah_asv_ss_librivox/nehemiah_1_asv_64kb.mp3", "duration": 736}, {"section": 2, "title": "2 - Chapters 04-06", "readers": [908], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/nehemiah_asv_ss_librivox/nehemiah_2_asv_64kb.mp3", "duration": 687}, {"section": 3, "title": "3 - Chapters 07-10", "readers": [908], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/nehemiah_asv_ss_librivox/nehemiah_3_asv_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1450}, {"section": 4, "title": "4 - Chapters 11-13", "readers": [908], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/nehemiah_asv_ss_librivox/nehemiah_4_asv_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1033}]}
