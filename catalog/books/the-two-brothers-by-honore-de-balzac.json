{"title": "Two Brothers", "description": "\u201cThe Two Brothers\u201d (1842) is part of Balzac\u2019s great life work, the novel series known as \u201cThe Human Comedy.\u201d Balzac\u2019s French title was \u201cLa Rabouilleuse\u201d; other English translations have been variously titled \u201cThe Black Sheep\u201d and \u201cA Bachelor\u2019s Establishment.\u201d\r\n<br><br>\r\nAfter initially detailing the backstories of his characters, Balzac launches into an engaging and searing portrait of family relationships: parental, filial, and sibling relations are all tested to the breaking point. \r\n<br><br>\r\nIn small town in post-Napoleonic France, a father mistakenly believes that his daughter is not his legitimate offspring, and hustles her off to be raised by his in-laws in Paris. This girl grows up, marries, and becomes the mother of two boys. Mistakenly, she dotes on only one of these sons, unable to see that the lad is in fact a selfish, cruel scoundrel. \r\n<br><br>\r\nMeanwhile, back in the provinces, her brother, still ensconced in the family home, has grown up to be a feckless non-entity, vulnerable to the manipulations of those around him, including an attractive servant girl (\u201cLa Rabouilleuse\u201d) who has been taken into the household.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThings get complicated when the Paris branch of the family returns to the small town, hoping to carve out for themselves a share of the late father\u2019s inheritance. - Summary by Bruce Pirie", "duration": 49224, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "86", "name": "Honor\u00e9 de Balzac"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/twobrothers_2403_librivox/twobrothers_2403.jpg", "copyright_year": "1887", "genres": ["Literary Fiction", "Published 1800 -1900"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Bruce Pirie"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Bruce Pirie"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Ann Boulais"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Winnifred Assmann"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Chapter 1", "readers": [3699], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/twobrothers_2403_librivox/twobrothers_01_balzac_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2292}, {"section": 2, "title": "Chapter 2", "readers": [3699], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/twobrothers_2403_librivox/twobrothers_02_balzac_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2949}, {"section": 3, "title": "Chapter 3", "readers": [3699], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/twobrothers_2403_librivox/twobrothers_03_balzac_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2987}, {"section": 4, "title": "Chapter 4", "readers": [3699], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/twobrothers_2403_librivox/twobrothers_04_balzac_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2695}, {"section": 5, "title": "Chapter 5", "readers": [3699], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/twobrothers_2403_librivox/twobrothers_05_balzac_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2572}, {"section": 6, "title": "Chapter 6", "readers": [3699], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/twobrothers_2403_librivox/twobrothers_06_balzac_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2690}, {"section": 7, "title": "Chapter 7", "readers": [3699], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/twobrothers_2403_librivox/twobrothers_07_balzac_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3880}, {"section": 8, "title": "Chapter 8", "readers": [3699], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/twobrothers_2403_librivox/twobrothers_08_balzac_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2699}, {"section": 9, "title": "Chapter 9", "readers": [3699], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/twobrothers_2403_librivox/twobrothers_09_balzac_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2652}, {"section": 10, "title": "Chapter 10", "readers": [3699], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/twobrothers_2403_librivox/twobrothers_10_balzac_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2705}, {"section": 11, "title": "Chapter 11", "readers": [3699], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/twobrothers_2403_librivox/twobrothers_11_balzac_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2793}, {"section": 12, "title": "Chapter 12", "readers": [3699], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/twobrothers_2403_librivox/twobrothers_12_balzac_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2806}, {"section": 13, "title": "Chapter 13", "readers": [3699], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/twobrothers_2403_librivox/twobrothers_13_balzac_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2616}, {"section": 14, "title": "Chapter 14", "readers": [3699], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/twobrothers_2403_librivox/twobrothers_14_balzac_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3084}, {"section": 15, "title": "Chapter 15", "readers": [3699], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/twobrothers_2403_librivox/twobrothers_15_balzac_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2726}, {"section": 16, "title": "Chapter 16", "readers": [3699], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/twobrothers_2403_librivox/twobrothers_16_balzac_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3193}, {"section": 17, "title": "Chapter 17", "readers": [3699], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/twobrothers_2403_librivox/twobrothers_17_balzac_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3885}]}
