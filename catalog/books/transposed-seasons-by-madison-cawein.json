{"title": "Transposed Seasons", "description": "LibriVox volunteers bring you 17 recordings of Transposed Seasons by Madison Cawein.<br>\nThis was the Weekly Poetry project for  November 3, 2019.   <br> ------<br>Mr. Cawein's landscape is not the sea, nor the desert, nor the mountain, but the lovely inland levels of his Kentucky.
