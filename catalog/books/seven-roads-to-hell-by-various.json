{"title": "Seven Roads to Hell", "description": "No one goes to hell by committing sin in the abstract, sin in general. Our character traits, talents and dispositions, \nour experiences \u2014 everything about us points out to us a particular road to hell \u2014 one of the seven that are called the \ncapital sins. For us, this or that particular one is the fastest and easiest because of who we are, what we are, where we \nfind ourselves. And the road sign will read either pride, covetousness, lust, anger, gluttony, envy or sloth. <br><br>\n\nThe seven capital sins are called capital because they are the sins of primary importance and inevitably spawn a whole \nlitter of other sins. Pride leads to boasting, ostentation, hypocrisy; envy is followed by hatred, discord, a restless quest \nfor riches and honors, and constant turmoil of soul. The slothful man is idle, aimless, neglects his spiritual duties and \nthe obligations of his state in life. And so on for the other capital sins. They all lead to other sins. They\u2019re all roads \nto hell. Most important, we must find out whether we\u2019re traveling one of these roads.
