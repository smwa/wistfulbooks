{"title": "Wayside and Woodland Trees: Pocket guide to the British Sylva", "description": "\"The purpose of this volume is not the addition of one more to the numerous treatises upon sylviculture or forestry, but to afford a straightforward means for the identification of our native trees and larger shrubs for the convenience of the rural rambler and Nature-lover. The list of British arborescent plants is a somewhat meagre one, but all that could be done in a pocket volume by way of supplementing it has been done\u2014by adding some account of those exotics that have long been naturalized in our woods, and a few of more recent introduction that have already become conspicuous ornaments in many public and private parks.\" From the Preface - Summary by KHand", "duration": 16248, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "12988", "name": "Edward Step"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/british_trees_1712_librivox/wayside_woodland_trees_1712.jpg", "copyright_year": "0", "genres": ["Nature", "Reference"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "KHand"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "KHand"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Lynne T"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Helen Z.
