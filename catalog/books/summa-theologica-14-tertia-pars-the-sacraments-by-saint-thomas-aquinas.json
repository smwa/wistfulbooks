{"title": "Summa Theologica - 14 Tertia Pars, The Sacraments", "description": "The Summa Theologica (or the Summa Theologiae or simply the Summa, written 1265\u20131274) is the most famous work of Thomas Aquinas (c. 1225\u20131274) although it was never finished. It was intended as a manual for beginners and a compilation of all of the main theological teachings of that time. It summarizes the reasoning for almost all points of Christian theology in the West, which, before the Protestant Reformation, subsisted solely in the Roman Catholic Church. The Summa's topics follow a cycle: the existence of God, God's creation, Man, Man's purpose, Christ, the Sacraments, and back to God. (Summary adapted from the Wikipedia) <br><br>   \n\nThis selection of the Summa Theologica covers questions 60-90 of the Tertia Pars (\"Third Part\"), comprising a Treatise on the Sacraments: the sacraments in general (questions 60-65) and in particular (questions 66-90), whether on Baptism (66-71), Confirmation (72), Eucharist (53-83), or Penance (84-90) - at which point Aquinas' composition of the Summa ended abruptly.", "duration": 89139, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "1199", "name": "Saint Thomas Aquinas"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/summatheologica14_2101_librivox/summa_theologica14_2101.jpg", "copyright_year": "0", "genres": ["Early Modern", "Christianity - Other"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "M.S.C.
