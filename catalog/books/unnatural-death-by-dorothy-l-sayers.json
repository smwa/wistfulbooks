{"title": "Unnatural Death", "description": "This is the third book in the Lord Peter Wimsey mystery series.* <br>\r\nAs the story opens, a country doctor is telling Lord Peter Wimsey about the Unnatural Death of one of his patients. He\u2019s convinced she was murdered, but powerless to act. To begin with, she would in any case have died within a few months. Moreover, the medical evidence clearly indicated the cause of death as heart failure, which was only to be expected.<br><br>\r\n\r\nIntrigued, Lord Peter looks into the matter, supported \u2013 as usual \u2013 by his friend Chief Inspector Parker of Scotland Yard, and his valet, Bunter (both recurring characters in the Lord Peter Wimsey mystery series).<br><br>\r\n\r\nNew to the author\u2019s cast of detective characters is Miss Alexandra Katharine Climpson, a prim, middle aged spinster who lends both charm and variety to the narrative. To Lord Peter, Miss Climpson represents an important but consistently overlooked national resource: post-war England\u2019s thousands of \u201csuperfluous females,\u201d with their uncanny facility for finding things out. His explanation is as follows: We gather intelligence by \u201cemploying a man with large flat feet,\u201d who communicates \u201cin a series of inarticulate grunts,\u201d instead of sending out \u201ca lady with a long, woolly jumper \u2026 and jingly things round her neck \u2026\u201d who could discover far more, and probably faster, since \u201ceveryone expects of course she asks questions.\u201d Certainly Miss Climpson does.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe latter part of the book is fast-paced, action-packed and suspenseful, as Inspector Parker, Mr. Bunter, Miss Climpson and Lord Peter pursue various lines of inquiry that ultimately join to explain why and how the murders were done. <br><br>\r\n\r\n*<a href=\"https://librivox.org/whose-body-version-2-by-dorothy-l-sayers/\">Whose Body?</a> and <a href=\"https://librivox.org/clouds-of-witness-by-dorothy-l-sayers/\">Clouds of Witness</a> are the first two Lord Peter Wimsey mysteries. -Summary by Kirsten Wever", "duration": 37557, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "2018", "name": "Dorothy L.
