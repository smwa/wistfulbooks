{"title": "Ludwig Van Beethoven", "description": "The late Pitts Sanborn wrote this booklet under the title Beethoven and his Nine Symphonies...  I have left Mr. Sanborn\u2019s pages on the symphonies virtually intact and have only expanded the work a little by incorporating here and there matter about other major works of Beethoven\u2019s, especially some of the concertos, overtures, piano and vocal works, besides certain of the greater specimens of his chamber music.,,,  I have followed it in order to supply a rather fuller picture of the composer\u2019s creative achievements. - Summary by Editor's Note (Herbert F.
