{"title": "Notes On Democracy", "description": "American journalist H.L. Mencken\u2019s Notes On Democracy was originally published in 1926, yet is still relevant almost 100 years later.\r\nMencken has proposed some succinct and satirical definitions of democracy, such as,\r\n\u201cDemocracy is the theory that the common people know what they want, and deserve to get it good and hard.\u201d And,\r\n\u201cDemocracy is the art and science of running the circus from the monkey house.\u201d\r\nOne predictable result of democracy, Mencken explains, is that the professional politician, who\u2019s objective is always the job, and not the principle, is in a constant struggle for office and its rewards. The defeated candidate commonly takes his failure very badly. Regarding these sore loser \u201clame ducks\u201d, he says:\r\n\u201c\u2026now and then there appears one whose wounds are too painful to be assuaged\u2026. \u2026This majestic victim not infrequently seeks surcease by a sort of running amok. That is to say, he turns what remains of his influence with the mob [common man] into a weapon against the nation as a whole, and becomes a chronic maker of trouble.\u201d\r\nNotes On Democracy is a refreshing description of what a democracy is, and how it works, \u2026and how it doesn\u2019t work, and has timeless relevance in light of today\u2019s political climate. - Summary by Lisa Reichert", "duration": 18009, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "637", "name": "H.
