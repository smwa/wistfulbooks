The types which live again in his pages are thus not only what he observed, but what he himself impersonated in his own experience.\" (from the BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH (introduction to) COMPLETE POETICAL WORKS By Bret Harte)", "duration": 1216, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "40", "name": "Bret Harte"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/coyote_harte_1602.poem_librivox/coyote_1602.jpg", "copyright_year": "1902", "genres": ["Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Coyote - Read by ALP", "readers": [4705], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/coyote_harte_1602.poem_librivox/coyote_harte_alp_64kb.mp3", "duration": 81}, {"section": 2, "title": "Coyote - Read by BK", "readers": [8786], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/coyote_harte_1602.poem_librivox/coyote_harte_bk_64kb.mp3", "duration": 90}, {"section": 3, "title": "Coyote - Read by BSD", "readers": [10402], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/coyote_harte_1602.poem_librivox/coyote_harte_bsd_64kb.mp3", "duration": 71}, {"section": 4, "title": "Coyote - Read by CB", "readers": [9862], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/coyote_harte_1602.poem_librivox/coyote_harte_cb_64kb.mp3", "duration": 68}, {"section": 5, "title": "Coyote - Read by DK", "readers": [10631], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/coyote_harte_1602.poem_librivox/coyote_harte_dk_64kb.mp3", "duration": 72}, {"section": 6, "title": "Coyote - Read by DL", "readers": [2911], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/coyote_harte_1602.poem_librivox/coyote_harte_dl_64kb.mp3", "duration": 81}, {"section": 7, "title": "Coyote - Read by EL", "readers": [9872], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/coyote_harte_1602.poem_librivox/coyote_harte_el_64kb.mp3", "duration": 78}, {"section": 8, "title": "Coyote - Read by GG", "readers": [8011], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/coyote_harte_1602.poem_librivox/coyote_harte_gg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 92}, {"section": 9, "title": "Coyote - Read by IK", "readers": [7785], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/coyote_harte_1602.poem_librivox/coyote_harte_ik_64kb.mp3", "duration": 83}, {"section": 10, "title": "Coyote - Read by LAH", "readers": [1212], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/coyote_harte_1602.poem_librivox/coyote_harte_lah_64kb.mp3", "duration": 79}, {"section": 11, "title": "Coyote - Read by LLW", "readers": [4738], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/coyote_harte_1602.poem_librivox/coyote_harte_llw_64kb.mp3", "duration": 94}, {"section": 12, "title": "Coyote - Read by MK", "readers": [8051], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/coyote_harte_1602.poem_librivox/coyote_harte_mk_64kb.mp3", "duration": 89}, {"section": 13, "title": "Coyote - Read by PS", "readers": [8576], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/coyote_harte_1602.poem_librivox/coyote_harte_ps_64kb.mp3", "duration": 72}, {"section": 14, "title": "Coyote - Read by RF", "readers": [10645], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/coyote_harte_1602.poem_librivox/coyote_harte_rf_64kb.mp3", "duration": 80}, {"section": 15, "title": "Coyote - Read by RP", "readers": [6924], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/coyote_harte_1602.poem_librivox/coyote_harte_rp_64kb.mp3", "duration": 86}]}
