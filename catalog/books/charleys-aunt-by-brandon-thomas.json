{"title": "Charley's Aunt", "description": "The girlfriends are coming to visit the chaps at college, but of course they can't stay unless there is a proper chaperone. So what could be more reasonable that getting a friend from the Drama Club to dress up and pretend to be Charley's Aunt? Simple and sure to work! What could go wrong? Howsabout the real aunt arriving?  This play has been revived and adapted numerous times including as films, a Broadway musical, and even an opera. (NOTE: the script contains an almost overwhelming number of stage directions by the author telling each actor what emotion to show, where to move, and even how to create some of the visual effects. Because the directions give a good idea of the on-stage pandemonium one would see at a production of this farce, I have chosen to leave the directions in this audio performance.) - Summary by ToddHW\n<BR><BR>Cast list:<BR>\nSTEPHEN SPETTIGUE, Solicitor, Oxford: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/12500\">Foon</a><br>\nCOLONEL SIR FRANCIS CHESNEY, BART., Late Indian Service: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/8425\">Larry Wilson</a><br>\nJACK CHESNEY, Graduate at St. Olde's College, Oxford: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/12431\">Tom Daley</a><br>\nCHARLEY WYKEHAM, Graduate at St. Olde's College, Oxford: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/11905\">Wolfgang Bas</a><br>\nLORD FANCOURT BABBERLEY, Graduate at St. Olde's College, Oxford: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/10789\">Tomas Peter</a><br>\nBRASSETT, A College Scout: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/6754\">ToddHW</a><br>\nDONNA-LUCIA D'ALVADOREZ, From Brazil: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/10179\">Sonia</a><br>\nAMY SPETTIGUE, Spettigue's Niece: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/10614\">Leanne Yau</a><br>\nKITTY VERDUN, Spettigue's Ward: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/6281\">Beth Thomas</a><br>\nELA DELAHAY: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/11790\">TJ Burns</a><br>\nStage Directions: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/11084\">Devorah Allen</a><br>\nEdited by: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/6754\">ToddHW</a>", "duration": 14097, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "13326", "name": "Brandon Thomas"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/charleysaunt_1808_librivox/charleys_aunt_1808.jpg", "copyright_year": "1892", "genres": ["Humorous Fiction", "Plays"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "ToddHW"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "ToddHW"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Sonia"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Act 1 Part 1", "readers": [], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/charleysaunt_1808_librivox/charleysaunt_1_thomas_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2874}, {"section": 2, "title": "Act 1 Part 2", "readers": [], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/charleysaunt_1808_librivox/charleysaunt_2_thomas_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3027}, {"section": 3, "title": "Act 2 Part 1", "readers": [], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/charleysaunt_1808_librivox/charleysaunt_3_thomas_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2970}, {"section": 4, "title": "Act 2 Part 2", "readers": [], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/charleysaunt_1808_librivox/charleysaunt_4_thomas_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1873}, {"section": 5, "title": "Act 3", "readers": [], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/charleysaunt_1808_librivox/charleysaunt_5_thomas_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3353}]}
