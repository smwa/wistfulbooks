{"title": "Status Civilization", "description": "Will Barrent awakes without memories just before being deposited on Omega, a planet for criminals where the average life expectancy is 3 years. He\u2019s listed as a murderer and released into the illicit society as a \u201cpeon\u201d the lowest class imaginable. A mysterious girl gives him a weapon that starts him on his path to status, a path that requires constant brutality. But it must be borne if our hero is to discover the reason for his imprisonment; A reason that pits him against himself, and involves the sardonically similar but devoutly different creeds of Omega and Earth. - The Status Civilization was first published as \u201cOmega!\u201d in the August and September 1960 issues of Amazing Science Fiction Stories Magazine.
