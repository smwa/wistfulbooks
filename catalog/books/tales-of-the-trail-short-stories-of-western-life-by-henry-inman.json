{"title": "Tales Of The Trail; Short Stories Of Western Life", "description": "This 1898 collection of thirteen previously published articles exhibits the acute perception of one of the most popular writers of the late 19th-early 20th centuries.  \u201cThese \"Tales of the Trail\" are based upon actual facts which came under the personal observation of the author\u2026 and will form another interesting series of stories of that era of great adventures, when the country west of the Missouri was unknown except to the trappers, hunters, and army officers.\u201d  Henry Inman (1837 \u2013 1899) was an American soldier, frontiersman, and author. He served in the military during the Indian campaigns and the American Civil War, having earned distinction for gallantry on the battlefield. He was commissioned lieutenant general during the Indian wars. He settled in Kansas and worked as a journalist and author of short stories and books of the plains and western frontier. - Summary by Wikipedia, Book Preface, David Wales", "duration": 21974, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "14115", "name": "Henry Inman"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/tales_of_the_trail_1906_librivox/talesofthetrail_1906.jpg", "copyright_year": "1917", "genres": ["Short Stories", "Westerns", "War & Military"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "David Wales"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "David Wales"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "DaveC"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "DaveC"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Preface", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/tales_of_the_trail_1906_librivox/talesofthetrail_00_inman_64kb.mp3", "duration": 119}, {"section": 1, "title": "General Forsythe At The Arrickaree", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/tales_of_the_trail_1906_librivox/talesofthetrail_01_inman_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1773}, {"section": 2, "title": "El Solitario, The Hermit Priest Of Old Santa Fe", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/tales_of_the_trail_1906_librivox/talesofthetrail_02_inman_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1790}, {"section": 3, "title": "Medicine Bluff", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/tales_of_the_trail_1906_librivox/talesofthetrail_03_inman_64kb.mp3", "duration": 951}, {"section": 4, "title": "A Race For Life: An Incident Of The Indian War Of 1864", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/tales_of_the_trail_1906_librivox/talesofthetrail_04_inman_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2983}, {"section": 5, "title": "The Tragedy At Twin Mounds: An Incident Of The Indian War Of 1866-67", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/tales_of_the_trail_1906_librivox/talesofthetrail_05_inman_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2643}, {"section": 6, "title": "Wal.
