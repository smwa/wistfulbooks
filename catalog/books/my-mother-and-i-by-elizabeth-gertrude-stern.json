{"title": "My Mother and I", "description": "Elizabeth Stern was two and a half years old, when her family emigrated from Poland to Pittsburgh. <i>My Mother and I</i> is the story of Stern's Americanization and how it ultimately alienated her from her parents. Stern's father had been a small village rabbi. Strict and traditional in his views, he sends Elizabeth to learn Hebrew at age four, so she can fulfill her destiny \"as the wife of a rabbi or scholar,\" but he opposes letting her attend high school. Stern's mother tries fitfully to pry open doors for her daughter. When Stern's father finds Elizabeth reading a secular book, and, in a fit of rage, flings the offending novel onto the top of a tall bookcase, her mother climbs on a chair and retrieves it for her. But Stern's mother never learns English even as it becomes her daughter\u2019s primary language--and she is burdened by endless pregnancies (she ultimately bears 11 children, only the first 4 of whom survive). Stern's relationship with her mother is loving, but when Elizabeth goes to college, they draw apart. Her mother becomes a \"shadowy figure,\" standing with \"questioning, puzzled eyes\", eyes in which there is love, \"but no understanding, and always an infinite loneliness.\" - Summary by Sue Anderson", "duration": 12991, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "11036", "name": "Elizabeth Gertrude Stern"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/mymotherandi_1503_librivox/mymotherandi_1503.jpg", "copyright_year": "1917", "genres": ["Memoirs"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Sue Anderson"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Sue Anderson"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "TriciaG"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "sidneyg"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Foreward, The Kitchen", "readers": [3003], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/mymotherandi_1503_librivox/mymotherandi_01_stern_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1404}, {"section": 2, "title": "Playing Was Forbidden, Letters to Home", "readers": [3003], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/mymotherandi_1503_librivox/mymotherandi_02_stern_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1430}, {"section": 3, "title": "The American Flag, A Baby Sister", "readers": [3003], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/mymotherandi_1503_librivox/mymotherandi_03_stern_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1229}, {"section": 4, "title": "The Little Grey House, Little Women", "readers": [3003], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/mymotherandi_1503_librivox/mymotherandi_04_stern_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1253}, {"section": 5, "title": "Girls Don't Go To High School", "readers": [3003], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/mymotherandi_1503_librivox/mymotherandi_05_stern_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1471}, {"section": 6, "title": "A Sabbath Room", "readers": [3003], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/mymotherandi_1503_librivox/mymotherandi_06_stern_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1315}, {"section": 7, "title": "College and the Cost of Dowries", "readers": [3003], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/mymotherandi_1503_librivox/mymotherandi_07_stern_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1148}, {"section": 8, "title": "A 21st Birthday Party", "readers": [3003], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/mymotherandi_1503_librivox/mymotherandi_08_stern_64kb.mp3", "duration": 894}, {"section": 9, "title": "Leaving Home", "readers": [3003], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/mymotherandi_1503_librivox/mymotherandi_09_stern_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1113}, {"section": 10, "title": "New York, Marriage", "readers": [3003], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/mymotherandi_1503_librivox/mymotherandi_10_stern_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1006}, {"section": 11, "title": "Mother Visits Her Grandson", "readers": [3003], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/mymotherandi_1503_librivox/mymotherandi_11_stern_64kb.mp3", "duration": 728}]}
