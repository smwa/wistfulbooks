The Fourth National Climate Assessment \u2013 Volume II is a 2018 report written in non-technical language by the U.S. Global Change Research Program, a panel of independent experts, as mandated by the Global Change Research Act of 1990. This report focuses on the human welfare, societal, and environmental elements of climate change and variability in the U.S., with particular attention paid to observed and projected risks and impacts. The report also considers risk reduction and the implications under different mitigation pathways.<br><br>\nThis audiobook is an abridged version of the full written report, which totaled more than 1600 pages. The Front Matter, Overview and Frequently Asked Questions chapters were recorded in their entireties, whereas only the Executive Summaries were recorded for all other chapters.
