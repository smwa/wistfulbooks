{"title": "Gudrun", "description": "The charming story of \u201cGudrun\u201d is a romance of the old heroic period, written by some unknown poet of Austria or Bavaria in the thirteenth century. Next to the \"Nibelungen Lied,\" it is the most important of the German epic poems...The same elemental passions are depicted. The men are brave, vigorous heroes, rejoicing in battle and feats of prowess; the women are beautiful, constant, and courageous. There are many fine delineations of character in the original, as well as vigorous sketches of northern scenery. The figure of Gudrun stands out in bold relief among the maidens. There are few more beautiful characters, indeed, in the poems of the old heroic period...Gudrun\u2019s name is always spoken by her people with reverence. \"Her courage and constancy were extolled by them, and in after days her fame was as radiant as the stars in the heavens.\" (George P. Upton, Translator's Preface)", "duration": 8490, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "14145", "name": "Ferdinand Schmidt"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/librivoxcdcoverart34/gudrun_2001.jpg", "copyright_year": "1906", "genres": ["Children's Fiction", "Action & Adventure Fiction", "Culture & Heritage Fiction"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Steven Fellows"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Steven Fellows"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Sonia"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Sonia"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Translator's Preface", "readers": [13563], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/gudrun_1912_librivox/gudrun_00_schmidt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 142}, {"section": 1, "title": "The Maiden and the Princely Suitor", "readers": [13563], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/gudrun_1912_librivox/gudrun_01_schmidt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 375}, {"section": 2, "title": "The Contest", "readers": [13563], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/gudrun_1912_librivox/gudrun_02_schmidt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 398}, {"section": 3, "title": "Siegfried's Revenge", "readers": [13563], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/gudrun_1912_librivox/gudrun_03_schmidt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 215}, {"section": 4, "title": "Hartmut Captures Gudrun", "readers": [13563], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/gudrun_1912_librivox/gudrun_04_schmidt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 252}, {"section": 5, "title": "The Evil Tidings", "readers": [13563], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/gudrun_1912_librivox/gudrun_05_schmidt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 290}, {"section": 6, "title": "The Battle on the Wulpensand", "readers": [13563], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/gudrun_1912_librivox/gudrun_06_schmidt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 451}, {"section": 7, "title": "Gudrun's Danger", "readers": [13563], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/gudrun_1912_librivox/gudrun_07_schmidt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 164}, {"section": 8, "title": "The Reception", "readers": [13563], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/gudrun_1912_librivox/gudrun_08_schmidt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 200}, {"section": 9, "title": "Gudrun's Test", "readers": [13563], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/gudrun_1912_librivox/gudrun_09_schmidt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 350}, {"section": 10, "title": "Ortrun", "readers": [13563], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/gudrun_1912_librivox/gudrun_10_schmidt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 183}, {"section": 11, "title": "Gudrun's Trials", "readers": [13563], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/gudrun_1912_librivox/gudrun_11_schmidt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 214}, {"section": 12, "title": "On the Wulpensand", "readers": [13563], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/gudrun_1912_librivox/gudrun_12_schmidt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 354}, {"section": 13, "title": "The Tale of Hagen and the Griffin", "readers": [13563], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/gudrun_1912_librivox/gudrun_13_schmidt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1087}, {"section": 14, "title": "The Welcome Message", "readers": [13563], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/gudrun_1912_librivox/gudrun_14_schmidt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 355}, {"section": 15, "title": "The Two Knights", "readers": [13563], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/gudrun_1912_librivox/gudrun_15_schmidt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 687}, {"section": 16, "title": "Danger and Stratagem", "readers": [13563], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/gudrun_1912_librivox/gudrun_16_schmidt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 603}, {"section": 17, "title": "The Morning", "readers": [13563], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/gudrun_1912_librivox/gudrun_17_schmidt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 517}, {"section": 18, "title": "Hartmut Fights with Ortwin and Horant", "readers": [13563], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/gudrun_1912_librivox/gudrun_18_schmidt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 259}, {"section": 19, "title": "Ludwig Fights with Herwig", "readers": [13563], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/gudrun_1912_librivox/gudrun_19_schmidt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 168}, {"section": 20, "title": "Hartmut Fights with Wate", "readers": [13563], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/gudrun_1912_librivox/gudrun_20_schmidt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 154}, {"section": 21, "title": "Gudrun and Ortrun", "readers": [13563], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/gudrun_1912_librivox/gudrun_21_schmidt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 199}, {"section": 22, "title": "Retribution", "readers": [13563], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/gudrun_1912_librivox/gudrun_22_schmidt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 438}, {"section": 23, "title": "The Home Coming", "readers": [13563], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/gudrun_1912_librivox/gudrun_23_schmidt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 435}]}
