{"title": "St. George and St. Michael, Volume 2", "description": "\u2019St. George and St. Michael\u2019 is a little-known historical romance telling the story of a young couple who find themselves on opposing sides during the tumultuous years of the English Civil Wars.<br /><br />Tensions are rising between king and parliament, the Church of England and the numerous independent puritans, and rumours abound that Charles I will soon declare open war on the dissident elements within his realm. Seventeen-year-old Dorothy Vaughan knows little of the brewing conflict, yet is sure that her loyalty must be with her king and her nation. When she challenges her childhood friend, Richard Heywood, to prove himself a man and so worthy of winning her hand in marriage by becoming involved in the larger events that surround them, he finds that his convictions \u2013 both political and spiritual \u2013 lie with his father\u2019s and the puritans. Determined to do what he believes is right, Richard finds that he cannot shake his immovable conscience, even for the woman he loves.<br /><br />\nThough it is, for the most part, a realistic novel, \u2018St. George and St. Michael\u2019 is not without either the other-worldly atmosphere of the fantastic or the rich spiritual depth that characterises so much of MacDonald\u2019s writing.<br /><br
