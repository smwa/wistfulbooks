{"title": "Young Railroaders", "description": "While aimed at youths, this series of tales of the just-opening West makes a rollicking good story for adults, too. Three teen-age boys, trained as telegraphers, manage to get themselves in and out of a wide variety of harrowing circumstances. Using their knowledge of Morse code, the science of telegraphs, and the operation of railroads, the boys stir in native resourcefulness, quick-thinking, and when the occasion demands it, raw courage - to effect rescues, thwart thieves, and solve mysteries. If Tom Swift had lived in the nineteenth century, he could not have had more exciting escapades! (Summary by Mark F. Smith)", "duration": 30036, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "5358", "name": " Francis Lovell Coombs"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt19/young_railroaders_1206.jpg", "copyright_year": "1910", "genres": ["Action & Adventure"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Mark F.
