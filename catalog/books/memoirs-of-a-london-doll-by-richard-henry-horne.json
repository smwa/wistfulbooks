{"title": "Memoirs of a London Doll", "description": "This is a fictional work written in the early 20th century. The story is narrated by Maria Poppet, a doll with a unique consciousness, offering readers an imaginative perspective on life in London through her experiences. Following her journey from being crafted by a poor doll-maker to being adopted by various families, Maria provides insight into the lives of the children and adults she encounters, revealing both the joys and hardships of Victorian society. At the start of the narrative, we meet Maria as she is created in the workshop of Mr. Sprat, a small doll-maker residing in a cramped garret. In her vibrant introduction, Maria recounts her early observations and interactions with the Sprat family, including her first moments of consciousness and her desires to be part of the bustling world outside. As her story progresses, we witness her transition from the Sprat's doll workshop to being sold in a shop, ultimately becoming the cherished toy of a girl named Ellen Plummy. The opening chapters set the stage for Maria\u2019s adventures, filled with curiosity and wonder as she navigates the complexities of relationships, childhood, and society through her unique viewpoint. - Summary by VO Gal", "duration": 10478, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "4963", "name": " Richard Henry Horne"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/memoirsofalondondoll_2501_librivox/memoirs_london_doll_2501.jpg", "copyright_year": "1922", "genres": ["Children's Fiction", "Action & Adventure Fiction", "Fictional Biographies & Memoirs"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "VO Gal"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "VO Gal"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Barry Eads"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "April6090"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Introduction", "readers": [18069], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/memoirsofalondondoll_2501_librivox/memoirsofalondondoll_00_horne_64kb.mp3", "duration": 643}, {"section": 1, "title": "My Making", "readers": [18069], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/memoirsofalondondoll_2501_librivox/memoirsofalondondoll_01_horne_64kb.mp3", "duration": 486}, {"section": 2, "title": "My First Mama", "readers": [18069], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/memoirsofalondondoll_2501_librivox/memoirsofalondondoll_02_horne_64kb.mp3", "duration": 719}, {"section": 3, "title": "Twelfth Night", "readers": [18069], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/memoirsofalondondoll_2501_librivox/memoirsofalondondoll_03_horne_64kb.mp3", "duration": 601}, {"section": 4, "title": "The Little Milliners", "readers": [18069], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/memoirsofalondondoll_2501_librivox/memoirsofalondondoll_04_horne_64kb.mp3", "duration": 361}, {"section": 5, "title": "My First Frock and Trousers", "readers": [18069], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/memoirsofalondondoll_2501_librivox/memoirsofalondondoll_05_horne_64kb.mp3", "duration": 617}, {"section": 6, "title": "The Little Lady", "readers": [18069], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/memoirsofalondondoll_2501_librivox/memoirsofalondondoll_06_horne_64kb.mp3", "duration": 380}, {"section": 7, "title": "The West End of the Town", "readers": [18069], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/memoirsofalondondoll_2501_librivox/memoirsofalondondoll_07_horne_64kb.mp3", "duration": 415}, {"section": 8, "title": "A Narrow Escape", "readers": [18069], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/memoirsofalondondoll_2501_librivox/memoirsofalondondoll_08_horne_64kb.mp3", "duration": 603}, {"section": 9, "title": "Doll's Letters", "readers": [18069], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/memoirsofalondondoll_2501_librivox/memoirsofalondondoll_09_horne_64kb.mp3", "duration": 551}, {"section": 10, "title": "Playing with Fire", "readers": [18069], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/memoirsofalondondoll_2501_librivox/memoirsofalondondoll_10_horne_64kb.mp3", "duration": 545}, {"section": 11, "title": "The Portrait Painter", "readers": [18069], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/memoirsofalondondoll_2501_librivox/memoirsofalondondoll_11_horne_64kb.mp3", "duration": 414}, {"section": 12, "title": "Punch and Judy", "readers": [18069], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/memoirsofalondondoll_2501_librivox/memoirsofalondondoll_12_horne_64kb.mp3", "duration": 413}, {"section": 13, "title": "The City", "readers": [18069], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/memoirsofalondondoll_2501_librivox/memoirsofalondondoll_13_horne_64kb.mp3", "duration": 668}, {"section": 14, "title": "The Lord Mayor's Show", "readers": [18069], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/memoirsofalondondoll_2501_librivox/memoirsofalondondoll_14_horne_64kb.mp3", "duration": 590}, {"section": 15, "title": "The Lost Bracelet", "readers": [18069], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/memoirsofalondondoll_2501_librivox/memoirsofalondondoll_15_horne_64kb.mp3", "duration": 559}, {"section": 16, "title": "The New Grand Christmas Pantomime", "readers": [18069], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/memoirsofalondondoll_2501_librivox/memoirsofalondondoll_16_horne_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1328}, {"section": 17, "title": "Conclusion", "readers": [18069], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/memoirsofalondondoll_2501_librivox/memoirsofalondondoll_17_horne_64kb.mp3", "duration": 585}]}
