{"title": "Logic of Hegel", "description": "This is the William Wallace translation of the first part of Hegel's Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences on logic. This is an outline of Hegel's logical system that he would use and elaborate on during his lectures, it is a shorter version of his earlier publication The Science of Logic. The William Wallace translation is very influential and famous for its clarity, although he took some liberties and does not always stick closely to Hegel's original text. - Summary by Ryan Smallwood", "duration": 41361, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "4604", "name": " Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/logic_of_hegel_1610_librivox/logicofhegel_1610.jpg", "copyright_year": "1892", "genres": ["Modern"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Ryan Smallwood"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Ryan Smallwood"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Crln Yldz Ksr"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Nick Bulka"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Bibliographical Notice", "readers": [10784], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/logic_of_hegel_1610_librivox/logicofhegel_00_hegel_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1340}, {"section": 1, "title": "Introduction", "readers": [10784], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/logic_of_hegel_1610_librivox/logicofhegel_01_hegel_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2604}, {"section": 2, "title": "Preliminary Notion", "readers": [10784], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/logic_of_hegel_1610_librivox/logicofhegel_02_hegel_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3399}, {"section": 3, "title": "First Attitude of Thought to Objectivity", "readers": [10784], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/logic_of_hegel_1610_librivox/logicofhegel_03_hegel_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1689}, {"section": 4, "title": "Second Attitude of Thought to Objectivity - Part 1", "readers": [10784], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/logic_of_hegel_1610_librivox/logicofhegel_04_hegel_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1136}, {"section": 5, "title": "Second Attitude of Thought to Objectivity - Part 2", "readers": [10784], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/logic_of_hegel_1610_librivox/logicofhegel_05_hegel_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2474}, {"section": 6, "title": "Second Attitude of Thought to Objectivity - Part 3", "readers": [10784], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/logic_of_hegel_1610_librivox/logicofhegel_06_hegel_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1048}, {"section": 7, "title": "Third Attitude of Thought to Objectivity", "readers": [10784], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/logic_of_hegel_1610_librivox/logicofhegel_07_hegel_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1915}, {"section": 8, "title": "Logic Further Defined and Divided", "readers": [10784], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/logic_of_hegel_1610_librivox/logicofhegel_08_hegel_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1478}, {"section": 9, "title": "First Subdivision of Logic - Part 1", "readers": [10784], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/logic_of_hegel_1610_librivox/logicofhegel_09_hegel_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3384}, {"section": 10, "title": "First Subdivision of Logic - Part 2", "readers": [10784], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/logic_of_hegel_1610_librivox/logicofhegel_10_hegel_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2422}, {"section": 11, "title": "Second Subdivision of Logic - Part 1", "readers": [10784], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/logic_of_hegel_1610_librivox/logicofhegel_11_hegel_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2592}, {"section": 12, "title": "Second Subdivision of Logic - Part 2", "readers": [10784], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/logic_of_hegel_1610_librivox/logicofhegel_12_hegel_64kb.mp3", "duration": 943}, {"section": 13, "title": "Second Subdivision of Logic - Part 3", "readers": [10784], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/logic_of_hegel_1610_librivox/logicofhegel_13_hegel_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2198}, {"section": 14, "title": "Second Subdivision of Logic - Part 4", "readers": [10784], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/logic_of_hegel_1610_librivox/logicofhegel_14_hegel_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3085}, {"section": 15, "title": "Third Subdivision of Logic - Part 1", "readers": [10784], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/logic_of_hegel_1610_librivox/logicofhegel_15_hegel_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2796}, {"section": 16, "title": "Third Subdivision of Logic - Part 2", "readers": [10784], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/logic_of_hegel_1610_librivox/logicofhegel_16_hegel_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2061}, {"section": 17, "title": "Third Subdivision of Logic - Part 3", "readers": [10784], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/logic_of_hegel_1610_librivox/logicofhegel_17_hegel_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1980}, {"section": 18, "title": "Third Subdivision of Logic - Part 4", "readers": [10784], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/logic_of_hegel_1610_librivox/logicofhegel_18_hegel_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2817}]}
