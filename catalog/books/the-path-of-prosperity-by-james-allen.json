And the dream remained with me, and at last became substantial; and now I send it forth into the world on its mission of healing and blessedness, knowing that it cannot fail to reach the homes and hearts of those who are waiting and ready to receive it.", "duration": 7479, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "1323", "name": "James Allen"}], "coverArt": "http://www.archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt15/Path_Prosperity_1202.jpg", "copyright_year": "1906", "genres": ["*Non-fiction", "Philosophy", "Self-Help"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Andrea Fiore"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Andrea Fiore"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Ruth Golding"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Gesine"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "1 - The Lesson of Evil", "readers": [2196], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/path_prosperity_af_librivox/pathprosperity_1_allen_64kb.mp3", "duration": 885}, {"section": 2, "title": "2 - The World a Reflex of Mental States", "readers": [2196], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/path_prosperity_af_librivox/pathprosperity_2_allen_64kb.mp3", "duration": 818}, {"section": 3, "title": "3 - The Way Out of Undesirable Conditions", "readers": [2196], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/path_prosperity_af_librivox/pathprosperity_3_allen_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1778}, {"section": 4, "title": "4 - The Silent Power of Thought: Controlling and Directing One's Forces", "readers": [2196], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/path_prosperity_af_librivox/pathprosperity_4_allen_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1182}, {"section": 5, "title": "5 - The Secret of Health, Success, and Power", "readers": [2196], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/path_prosperity_af_librivox/pathprosperity_5_allen_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1552}, {"section": 6, "title": "6 - The Secret of Abounding Happiness", "readers": [2196], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/path_prosperity_af_librivox/pathprosperity_6_allen_64kb.mp3", "duration": 885}, {"section": 7, "title": "7 - The Realization of Prosperity", "readers": [2196], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/path_prosperity_af_librivox/pathprosperity_7_allen_64kb.mp3", "duration": 379}]}
