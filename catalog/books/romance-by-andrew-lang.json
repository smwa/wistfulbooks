{"title": "Romance", "description": "LibriVox volunteers bring you 16 readings of <em>Romance</em> by Andrew Lang, probably best known as Edward Elgar's song <em>My Love Dwelt in a Northern Land</em>. Interestingly, Lang initially refused permission for his words to be used as lyrics, and Elgar's wife Alice wrote alternative words <em>Afar, amidst the Sunny Isles</em> for the song. However, Lang later relented and gave permission for his poem to be used. <br/><br />The poem was initially published in The Century Magazine, May 1882, and this is the version recorded here. Later collections of Lang's poetry omit the third verse.
