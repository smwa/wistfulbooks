{"title": "Salt Mines and Castles: The Discovery and Restitution of Looted European Art", "description": "\"From May 1945 until February 1946, I served as a Monuments, Fine Arts and Archives Officer in Germany. During the first four months of this assignment, I was engaged in field work which included the recovery of looted works of art from such out-of-the-way places as a monastery in Czechoslovakia, a salt mine in Austria, and a castle in Bavaria. Later, as Deputy Chief of the Monuments, Fine Arts and Archives Section, Office of Military Government, U. S. Zone, I participated in the restitution of recovered art treasures to the countries of rightful ownership.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThis book is primarily an account of my own experiences in connection with these absorbing tasks; but I have also chronicled the activities of a number of my fellow officers, hoping thereby to provide the reader with a more comprehensive estimate of the work as a whole than the resum\u00e9 of my own duties could have afforded.\" - Summary by Thomas Carr Howe, Jr. (from the author's note)", "duration": 36107, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "16927", "name": "Thomas Carr Howe"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/salt_mines_and_castles_2207_librivox/saltminescastles_2207.jpg", "copyright_year": "1946", "genres": ["Art", "Design & Architecture", "Memoirs"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "TR Love"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "TR Love"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Lynne T"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Lynne T"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Paris\u2014London\u2014Versailles", "readers": [15829], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/salt_mines_and_castles_2207_librivox/saltmines_01_howe_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2873}, {"section": 2, "title": "Assigned to Frankfurt", "readers": [15829], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/salt_mines_and_castles_2207_librivox/saltmines_02_howe_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2446}, {"section": 3, "title": "Munich and the Beginning of Field Work", "readers": [15829], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/salt_mines_and_castles_2207_librivox/saltmines_03_howe_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3306}, {"section": 4, "title": "Masterpieces in a Monastery", "readers": [15829], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/salt_mines_and_castles_2207_librivox/saltmines_04_howe_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2983}, {"section": 5, "title": "Second Trip to Hohenfurth", "readers": [15829], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/salt_mines_and_castles_2207_librivox/saltmines_05_howe_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3197}, {"section": 6, "title": "Loot Underground: The Salt Mine at Alt Aussee", "readers": [15829], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/salt_mines_and_castles_2207_librivox/saltmines_06_howe_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2390}, {"section": 7, "title": "Loot Underground: The Salt Mine at Alt Aussee (Continued)", "readers": [15829], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/salt_mines_and_castles_2207_librivox/saltmines_07_howe_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2770}, {"section": 8, "title": "The Rothschild Jewels; the G\u00f6ring Collection", "readers": [15829], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/salt_mines_and_castles_2207_librivox/saltmines_08_howe_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1936}, {"section": 9, "title": "The Rothschild Jewels; the G\u00f6ring Collection (Continued)", "readers": [15829], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/salt_mines_and_castles_2207_librivox/saltmines_09_howe_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2269}, {"section": 10, "title": "The Rothschild Jewels; the G\u00f6ring Collection (Conclusion)", "readers": [15829], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/salt_mines_and_castles_2207_librivox/saltmines_10_howe_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1953}, {"section": 11, "title": "Looters\u2019 Castle: Schloss Neuschwanstein", "readers": [15829], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/salt_mines_and_castles_2207_librivox/saltmines_11_howe_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3117}, {"section": 12, "title": "Hidden Treasures at N\u00fcrnberg", "readers": [15829], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/salt_mines_and_castles_2207_librivox/saltmines_12_howe_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2052}, {"section": 13, "title": "Mission to Amsterdam; the Wiesbaden Manifesto", "readers": [15829], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/salt_mines_and_castles_2207_librivox/saltmines_13_howe_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2581}, {"section": 14, "title": "Mission to Amsterdam; the Wiesbaden Manifesto (Continued)", "readers": [15829], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/salt_mines_and_castles_2207_librivox/saltmines_14_howe_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2234}]}
