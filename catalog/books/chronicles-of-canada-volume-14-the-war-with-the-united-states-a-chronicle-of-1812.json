{"title": "Chronicles of Canada Volume 14 - The War With the United States: A Chronicle of 1812", "description": "\"International disputes that end in war are not generally questions of absolute right and wrong. They may quite as well be questions of opposing rights. But, when there are rights on both sides; it is usually found that the side which takes the initiative is moved by its national desires as well as by its claims of right.\n<BR><BR>\nThis could hardly be better exemplified than by the vexed questions which brought about the War of 1812.\"\n<BR><BR>\nThis volume of the Chronicles of Canada series explains both the causes of the War of 1812 and the campaigns of the war from a primarily Canadian viewpoint, a perspective that is very often missed in writings on this Americo-British conflict.
