{"title": "Fame and Fortune Weekly No. 8: The Wheel of Fortune", "description": " This is the story of Bert Hawley who, at a young age, saw his mother die of illness and had to fend off his drunken father in their ramshackle house in Virginia. From there he set out to make his fortune in Philadelphia, where he used his good charm and desire to promote a quality product to sell book subscriptions until he finally landed in New York as a Sales Manager. Bert shows us that, though our circumstances may seem grim, we must never lose our spirit and integrity.
