{"title": "His Dog", "description": "Albert Payson Terhune, perhaps best known for his book <i>Lad, a Dog</i> (later turned into a popular movie), was also a breeder of collies and a journalist. Some of his collie lines survive to this day.<br /><br /><i>His Dog</i> is a story about Link Ferris who finds an injured dog on his way home one evening. Knowing nothing about dogs, Link nurses the dog back to health and the two form a bond such as only can be formed between human and canine. Unable to locate the collie's owner, Link christens his dog 'Chum' who becomes invaluable in tending to the daily needs of his meager farm.<br /><br />Unknown to Ferris however, Chum's original owners have been looking for their lost collie, and the story finds Link torn between that which he knows is morally right and his love for what he believes has become <i>his dog</i>.
