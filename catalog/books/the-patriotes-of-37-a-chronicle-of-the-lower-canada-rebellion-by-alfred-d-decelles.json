A key goal was responsible government, which was eventually achieved in the incidents' aftermath. \"The people of Canada today are able to combine loyalty and liberty as the men of that day were not; and they should never forget that in some measure they owe to the one party (the \"Bureaucrats\") the continuance of Canada in the Empire, and to the other party (the \"<i>Patriotes</i>\") the freedom wherewith they have been made free.\" - Summary by TriciaG and from the text", "duration": 9947, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "17016", "name": "Alfred D.
