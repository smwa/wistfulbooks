{"title": "Richmond National Battlefield Park, Virginia", "description": "Richmond, Virginia, was the capital of The Confederacy during the American Civil War, 1861-1865.  It was the focus of two military campaigns by Northern armies, one in the summer of 1862 (the Peninsula Campaign) and the second in 1864-1865.   When the city was conquered and destroyed in early April, 1865, , it was only a few days later that General Lee surrendered to General Grant and the Civil War was over.  Published in 1961, this is National Park Service Historical Handbook 33.
