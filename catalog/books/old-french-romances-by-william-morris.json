The Tale of King Coustans the Emperor tells the ahistorical and unlikely story of how an abandoned child named Coustans becomes the Byzantine Emperor. The Friendship of Amis and Amile tells of the lifelong friendship and adventures of the look-alike duo of Amis and Amile. The Tale of King Florus and the Fair Jehane recounts two parallel stories. One being of Florus and his wish to have an heir and the second of Jehane and Robin's quest of redemption. The History of Over Sea is a story of pilgrimages, adventure, treachery, and forgiveness that takes place across several medieval Mediterranean settings.
