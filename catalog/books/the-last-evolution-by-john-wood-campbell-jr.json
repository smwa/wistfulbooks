{"title": "Last Evolution", "description": "John Campbell Jr. gives us a story about evolution.  What will be man's ultimate evolution?  What will he look like 100,000 years in the future?  And who will be his children?  \"It was 2538 years After the Year of the Son of Man. For six centuries mankind had been developing machines. The Ear-apparatus was discovered as early as seven hundred years before. The Eye came later, the Brain came much later. But by 2500, the machines had been developed to think, and act and work with perfect independence. Man lived on the products of the machine, and the machines lived to themselves very happily, and contentedly. Machines are designed to help and cooperate. It was easy to do the simple duties they needed to do that men might live well. And men had created them. Most of mankind were quite useless, for they lived in a world where no productive work was necessary.\" - Summary by the author", "duration": 3159, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "816", "name": "John Wood Campbell, Jr."}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/thelastevolution_2211_librivox/lastevolution_2211.jpg", "copyright_year": "0", "genres": ["Science Fiction"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Christine Rottger"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Part 1", "readers": [5717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/thelastevolution_2211_librivox/thelastevolution_01_campbell_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1718}, {"section": 2, "title": "Part 2", "readers": [5717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/thelastevolution_2211_librivox/thelastevolution_02_campbell_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1441}]}
