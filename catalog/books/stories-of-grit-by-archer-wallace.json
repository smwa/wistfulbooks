{"title": "Stories of Grit", "description": "\"There are just two classes of boys who should be permitted to read these fascinating pages.\r\n\r\nThe ambitious boys are in one class; those who are determined to make their lives count. That type of boy will be helped toward finding the best outlet for his services. He will learn of fields of investment for his life work which have brought rich returns to other boys. His vision will be broadened, his objective made higher.\r\n\r\nThe other class of boy who should read this book is that in whom the fires of ambition have not yet been kindled; he who is living on the dead level of life, just \"groping to and fro\". This type of boy will be inspired to tackle the climbing life when he learns of the handicaps which other boys have overcome and of the great goals they have won.\" - Summary from the introduction", "duration": 10921, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "17867", "name": "Archer Wallace"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/storiesofgrit_2312_librivox/storiesofgrit_2312.jpg", "copyright_year": "1925", "genres": ["Biography"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Lynne T"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Lynne T"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Winnifred Assmann"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Introduction", "readers": [18928], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/storiesofgrit_2312_librivox/storiesofgrit_00_wallace_64kb.mp3", "duration": 229}, {"section": 1, "title": "The Blind Boy who Became Poet, Preacher and Author", "readers": [18928], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/storiesofgrit_2312_librivox/storiesofgrit_01_wallace_64kb.mp3", "duration": 878}, {"section": 2, "title": "How a Lame Boy Became the World's Greatest Potter", "readers": [14499], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/storiesofgrit_2312_librivox/storiesofgrit_02_wallace_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1057}, {"section": 3, "title": "The Dutch Boy who Became a Great Editor", "readers": [17246], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/storiesofgrit_2312_librivox/storiesofgrit_03_wallace_64kb.mp3", "duration": 898}, {"section": 4, "title": "A Deaf Boy who Became a Great Bible Scholar", "readers": [18953], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/storiesofgrit_2312_librivox/storiesofgrit_04_wallace_64kb.mp3", "duration": 516}, {"section": 5, "title": "The Slave Boy who Became a Great Leader", "readers": [18721], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/storiesofgrit_2312_librivox/storiesofgrit_05_wallace_64kb.mp3", "duration": 730}, {"section": 6, "title": "The Immigrant Lad who Became a King of Industry", "readers": [17200], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/storiesofgrit_2312_librivox/storiesofgrit_06_wallace_64kb.mp3", "duration": 573}, {"section": 7, "title": "A Shoemaker's Apprentice who Became a Great Scholar", "readers": [18721], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/storiesofgrit_2312_librivox/storiesofgrit_07_wallace_64kb.mp3", "duration": 733}, {"section": 8, "title": "From Gipsy Tent to Pulpit", "readers": [18954], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/storiesofgrit_2312_librivox/storiesofgrit_08_wallace_64kb.mp3", "duration": 802}, {"section": 9, "title": "A Blind Man who Became Postmaster-General of England", "readers": [17246], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/storiesofgrit_2312_librivox/storiesofgrit_09_wallace_64kb.mp3", "duration": 755}, {"section": 10, "title": "The Ploughboy who Became a Famous Naturalist", "readers": [16615], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/storiesofgrit_2312_librivox/storiesofgrit_10_wallace_64kb.mp3", "duration": 725}, {"section": 11, "title": "A Sick Man who Never Gave Up", "readers": [18895], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/storiesofgrit_2312_librivox/storiesofgrit_11_wallace_64kb.mp3", "duration": 538}, {"section": 12, "title": "How a Poor Boy Became a Great Scientist", "readers": [18966], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/storiesofgrit_2312_librivox/storiesofgrit_12_wallace_64kb.mp3", "duration": 654}, {"section": 13, "title": "What an Illiterate Boy Made of His Life", "readers": [18979], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/storiesofgrit_2312_librivox/storiesofgrit_13_wallace_64kb.mp3", "duration": 872}, {"section": 14, "title": "A Donkey Boy who Became a Famous Sculptor", "readers": [16615], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/storiesofgrit_2312_librivox/storiesofgrit_14_wallace_64kb.mp3", "duration": 961}]}
