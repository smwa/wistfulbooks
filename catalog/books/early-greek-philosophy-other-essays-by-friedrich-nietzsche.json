{"title": "Early Greek Philosophy & Other Essays (Version 2)", "description": "\u201cThe essays contained in this volume treat of various subjects. With the exception of perhaps one we must consider all these papers as fragments. Written during the early Seventies, and intended mostly as prefaces, they are extremely interesting, since traces of Nietzsche's later tenets\u2014like Slave and Master morality, the Superman\u2014can be found everywhere. But they are also very valuable on account of the young philosopher's daring and able handling of difficult and abstruse subjects. \"Truth and Falsity,\" and \"The Greek Woman\" are probably the two essays which will prove most attractive to the average reader.\u201d - Summary by Maximilian M\u00fcgge, Translator", "duration": 24967, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "411", "name": "Friedrich Nietzsche"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/earlygreekphilosophy_2103_librivox/earlygreek_2104.jpg", "copyright_year": "1911", "genres": ["Modern"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "John Van Stan"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "John Van Stan"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "J.
