{"title": "Thousand Degrees Below Zero", "description": "The War to End All Wars has ended and the world has taken a deep breath and is trying to recover normal life in 1919.  But a super Villan intent on ruling the entire world has other ideas.  In his super fast helicopter (the Black Flyer) he sorties out to block the major ports and rives of the world until all nations with icebergs made by his fiendishly clever devices until they admit his supremacy and kneel before his might.  The might of nations are helpless before him but he does not count on our hero, a scientist specializing in low temperatures who was also a gunner in WWI.   Teamed with a daring pilot flying the latest fastest bi plane in the army, they tangle with this brilliant but deranged person and might be able to bring him down.  Do they?  Listen and find out in this thrilling adventure where planes zoom at up to 200 mph!!!!
