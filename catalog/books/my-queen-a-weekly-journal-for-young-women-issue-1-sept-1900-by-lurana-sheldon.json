{"title": "My Queen: A Weekly Journal for Young Women. Issue 1, Sept 1900", "description": "This is the first issue of a wonderful weekly magazine aimed at young women.  They each contain a novella following the adventures of Marion Marlowe, \"Only a Farmer's Daughter\" who went from \"Farm to Fortune\" and all written by the prolific :Lurana Sheldon using various pen names, usually Grace Shirley. The story is quite entertaining and well written.   The chapters are short and easy to read and suited to those just getting their feet wet in LibriVox. Besides the main novella, each issue contains an Advice Column, where she responds to anguished letters from young ladies with a myriad of personal problems.  She does not shy at shooting straight from the hip in her answers whether to moral, ethical, family or just social etiquette questions. An intersting insight into life in the 1900's and what was considered appropriate for girls and women.   - Summary by phil chenevert", "duration": 9170, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "13752", "name": "Lurana Sheldon"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/myqueenissue1_sept_1900_1903_librivox/my_queen_1_1903.jpg", "copyright_year": "1900", "genres": ["General"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "afutterer"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "The Daisy Chain", "readers": [12976], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/myqueenissue1_sept_1900_1903_librivox/myqueenissue01_01_sheldon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 638}, {"section": 2, "title": "The City Boarder", "readers": [11715], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/myqueenissue1_sept_1900_1903_librivox/myqueenissue01_02_sheldon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 504}, {"section": 3, "title": "Marion Proves her Intuitions", "readers": [11715], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/myqueenissue1_sept_1900_1903_librivox/myqueenissue01_03_sheldon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 562}, {"section": 4, "title": "The Abduction of Dollie", "readers": [10261], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/myqueenissue1_sept_1900_1903_librivox/myqueenissue01_04_sheldon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 672}, {"section": 5, "title": "A Dark Deed", "readers": [10261], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/myqueenissue1_sept_1900_1903_librivox/myqueenissue01_05_sheldon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 632}, {"section": 6, "title": "The Plot of a Villain", "readers": [10261], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/myqueenissue1_sept_1900_1903_librivox/myqueenissue01_06_sheldon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 669}, {"section": 7, "title": "On the Track of the Abductor", "readers": [12570], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/myqueenissue1_sept_1900_1903_librivox/myqueenissue01_07_sheldon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 589}, {"section": 8, "title": "The First News of Dollie", "readers": [12570], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/myqueenissue1_sept_1900_1903_librivox/myqueenissue01_08_sheldon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 631}, {"section": 9, "title": "The Picture on the Poster", "readers": [12536], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/myqueenissue1_sept_1900_1903_librivox/myqueenissue01_09_sheldon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 467}, {"section": 10, "title": "Marion Finds her Uncle At Last", "readers": [12536], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/myqueenissue1_sept_1900_1903_librivox/myqueenissue01_10_sheldon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 634}, {"section": 11, "title": "The Return of Miss Gray\\", "readers": [11715], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/myqueenissue1_sept_1900_1903_librivox/myqueenissue01_11_sheldon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 525}, {"section": 12, "title": "Marion Discovers Dollie", "readers": [11715], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/myqueenissue1_sept_1900_1903_librivox/myqueenissue01_12_sheldon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 501}, {"section": 13, "title": "The Arrest and Rescue", "readers": [11715], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/myqueenissue1_sept_1900_1903_librivox/myqueenissue01_13_sheldon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 491}, {"section": 14, "title": "Questions & Answers by Grace Shirley", "readers": [5717, 12500], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/myqueenissue1_sept_1900_1903_librivox/myqueenissue01_14_sheldon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1655}]}
