{"title": "During the Persecution: Autobiography of Father John Gerard", "description": "Fr. John Gerard (1564 \u2013 1637) was an English Jesuit priest who operated covertly in England during the Elizabethan era, during which the Catholic Church was subject to persecution.<br><br>\n\nGerard notably not only successfully hid from the English authorities for eight years before his capture but also endured extensive torture, escaped from the Tower of London, recovered and continued with his covert mission. After his escape to the Continent, he was instructed by his Jesuit superiors to write a book about his life. This is a rare first-hand account of the dangerous cloak-and-dagger world of a Catholic priest in Elizabethan England.<br><br>\n\nThis book, from a later translation, is more well known under the title \"Autobiography of a Hunted Priest\".
