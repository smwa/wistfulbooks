{"title": "Just David (Version 2)", "description": "Just David is the story of David, a little boy of 10 who is suddenly transplanted from a quiet, isolated, shut away world of music high in the mountains where he lived alone with his father, to the hustle and bustle of a small rural town.  He  is a boy who has been taught to love of music and everything beautiful in this world, from the sunset colors to a potato bug.  His heart is incredibly good and sweet and loving which is hard for the people in the village to understand.  Kind of like Pollyanna, it is a story of how he brings his own character, courage and happiness into the lives of the people he meets, and slowly opens their eyes to the amazing world he sees; a world full of miraculous things like pine trees and frogs.    - Summary by phil chenevert", "duration": 23927, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "1185", "name": "Eleanor H.
