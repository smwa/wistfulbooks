{"title": "Pan", "description": "<i>Pan</i> tells the story Lieutenant Glahn and his summer in a forest north in Norway. He lives in a hut with his dog Aesop and they spend their days to hunting and fishing. In poetic language, Hamsun paints troubled souls in this gem of a book.The text is devoted to the nature in Nordland as well as the people Glahn meets there, as they deal with love, jealousy, and power struggles. We meet two (equally unreliable) narrators, Lieutenant Glahn in the book itself and a hunting companion in the epilogue, consisting of the last five chapters. - Summary by kathrinee", "duration": 15062, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "1288", "name": "Knut Hamsun"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/pan_1609_librivox/pan_hansum_1609.jpg", "copyright_year": "1921", "genres": ["Published 1800 -1900"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Kathrine Engan"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Kathrine Engan"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Kathrine Engan"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "bandbw123"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "I-V", "readers": [7510], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/pan_1609_librivox/pan_01_hamsun_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1503}, {"section": 2, "title": "VI-X", "readers": [7510], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/pan_1609_librivox/pan_02_hamsun_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1822}, {"section": 3, "title": "XI-XVI", "readers": [7510], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/pan_1609_librivox/pan_03_hamsun_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2068}, {"section": 4, "title": "XVII-XX", "readers": [7510], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/pan_1609_librivox/pan_04_hamsun_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2339}, {"section": 5, "title": "XXI-XXV", "readers": [7510], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/pan_1609_librivox/pan_05_hamsun_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2878}, {"section": 6, "title": "XXVI-XXXVI", "readers": [7510], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/pan_1609_librivox/pan_06_hamsun_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2422}, {"section": 7, "title": "Glahn's Death: A Document of 1861 I-V", "readers": [7510], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/pan_1609_librivox/pan_07_hamsun_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2030}]}
