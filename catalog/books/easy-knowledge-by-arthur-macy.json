{"title": "Easy Knowledge", "description": "Arthur Macy did not consider his work of sufficiently high poetic standard to be published. Every one praised his choice of words, his wonderful facility in rhyme, the perfection of his metre, and the daintiness and delicacy of his verse. \"All right,\" he would say, \"but that is not Poetry with a big P, and that is the only kind that should be published. And there is mighty little of it.\"  (from the introduction to Poems by Arthur Macy; written by William Alfred Hovey, June 7, 1905)", "duration": 1197, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "2561", "name": "Arthur Macy"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/easy_knowledge_1808.poem_librivox/easy_knowledge_1808.jpg", "copyright_year": "1905", "genres": ["Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "David Lawrence"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Easy Knowledge - Read by BK", "readers": [8786], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/easy_knowledge_1808.poem_librivox/easyknowledge_macy_bk_64kb.mp3", "duration": 74}, {"section": 2, "title": "Easy Knowledge - Read by DL", "readers": [2911], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/easy_knowledge_1808.poem_librivox/easyknowledge_macy_dl_64kb.mp3", "duration": 74}, {"section": 3, "title": "Easy Knowledge - Read by DV", "readers": [10467], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/easy_knowledge_1808.poem_librivox/easyknowledge_macy_dv_64kb.mp3", "duration": 62}, {"section": 4, "title": "Easy Knowledge - Read by EL", "readers": [9872], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/easy_knowledge_1808.poem_librivox/easyknowledge_macy_el_64kb.mp3", "duration": 72}, {"section": 5, "title": "Easy Knowledge - Read by ERS", "readers": [12404], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/easy_knowledge_1808.poem_librivox/easyknowledge_macy_ers_64kb.mp3", "duration": 62}, {"section": 6, "title": "Easy Knowledge - Read by FH", "readers": [12500], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/easy_knowledge_1808.poem_librivox/easyknowledge_macy_fh_64kb.mp3", "duration": 61}, {"section": 7, "title": "Easy Knowledge - Read by GB", "readers": [4969], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/easy_knowledge_1808.poem_librivox/easyknowledge_macy_gb_64kb.mp3", "duration": 72}, {"section": 8, "title": "Easy Knowledge - Read by GG", "readers": [8011], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/easy_knowledge_1808.poem_librivox/easyknowledge_macy_gg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 77}, {"section": 9, "title": "Easy Knowledge - Read by GRS", "readers": [12484], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/easy_knowledge_1808.poem_librivox/easyknowledge_macy_grs_64kb.mp3", "duration": 64}, {"section": 10, "title": "Easy Knowledge - Read by JH", "readers": [10205], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/easy_knowledge_1808.poem_librivox/easyknowledge_macy_jh_64kb.mp3", "duration": 79}, {"section": 11, "title": "Easy Knowledge - Read by KE", "readers": [7510], "path": "", "duration": 0}, {"section": 12, "title": "Easy Knowledge - Read by LAH", "readers": [1212], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/easy_knowledge_1808.poem_librivox/easyknowledge_macy_lah_64kb.mp3", "duration": 70}, {"section": 13, "title": "Easy Knowledge - Read by MY", "readers": [11247], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/easy_knowledge_1808.poem_librivox/easyknowledge_macy_my_64kb.mp3", "duration": 77}, {"section": 14, "title": "Easy Knowledge - Read by RAJ", "readers": [12236], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/easy_knowledge_1808.poem_librivox/easyknowledge_macy_raj_64kb.mp3", "duration": 70}, {"section": 15, "title": "Easy Knowledge - Read by SWS", "readers": [11331], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/easy_knowledge_1808.poem_librivox/easyknowledge_macy_sws_64kb.mp3", "duration": 77}, {"section": 16, "title": "Easy Knowledge - Read by TP", "readers": [10789], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/easy_knowledge_1808.poem_librivox/easyknowledge_macy_tp_64kb.mp3", "duration": 70}, {"section": 17, "title": "Easy Knowledge - Read by VB", "readers": [8169], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/easy_knowledge_1808.poem_librivox/easyknowledge_macy_vb_64kb.mp3", "duration": 73}, {"section": 18, "title": "Easy Knowledge - Read by VERD", "readers": [12701], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/easy_knowledge_1808.poem_librivox/easyknowledge_macy_verd_64kb.mp3", "duration": 63}]}
