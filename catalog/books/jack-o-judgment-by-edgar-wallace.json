{"title": "Jack O' Judgment", "description": "Here we have another fine novel by the eminent British author Edgar Wallace. The usual mystery of this sort usually revolves around the classic \u201cwho done it\u201d theme. However this one is different. Rather than asking the question \u201cwho done it?\u201d this is rather a \u201cwho is it?\u201d. The reason for this is a vigilante in the story by the name of Jack O\u2019 Judgement. This interesting character is a cross between an assassin and a giggling clown that keeps the reader guessing as to his or her identity. Jack wants to exact justice where traditional law enforcement fails and wreaks havoc upon the villains in the story, the main one being Colonel Dan Boundary as well as his gang. The inevitable good guys are also present in the form of a young policeman named Stafford King and his potential beau Maisie White. A classic tale of the crime/detective genre.
