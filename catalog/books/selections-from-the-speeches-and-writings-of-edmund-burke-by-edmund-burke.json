{"title": "Selections from the Speeches and Writings of Edmund Burke", "description": "There can be no hesitation in according to him a station among the most extraordinary men that ever appeared; and we think there is now but little diversity of opinion as to the kind of place which it is fit to assign him. He was a writer of the first class, and excelled in almost every kind of composition. Possessed of most extensive knowledge, and of the most various description; acquainted alike with what different classes of men knew, each in his own province, and with much that hardly any one ever thought of learning; he could either bring his masses of information to bear directly upon the subjects to which they severally belonged,\u2014or he could avail himself of them generally to strengthen his faculties, and enlarge his views,\u2014or he could turn any of them to account for the purpose of illustrating his theme, or enriching his diction. Hence, when he is handling any one matter, we perceive that we are conversing with a reasoner or a teacher, to whom almost every other branch of knowledge is familiar: his views range over all the cognate objects; his reasonings are derived from principles applicable to other themes, as well as the one in hand; arguments pour in from all sides, as well as those which start up under our feet,\u2014the natural growth of the path he is leading us over; while to throw light round our steps, and either explore its darkest places, or serve for our recreation; illustrations are fetched from a thousand quarters, and an imagination marvelously quick to descry unthought of resemblances, points to our use the stores, which a love yet more marvelously has gathered from all ages and nations, and arts and tongues. - Summary by Sir James Mackintosh", "duration": 65713, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "3621", "name": "Edmund Burke"}], "coverArt":
