{"title": "Extract from Captain Stormfield\u2019s Visit to Heaven (version 4)", "description": "Mark Twain pokes a little good natured fun at the usual concept of heaven.  The story follows Captain Elias Stormfield on his extremely long cosmic journey to heaven; his accidental misplacement; his short-lived interest in singing and playing the harp (generated by his preconceptions of heaven); and the obsession of souls with the \"celebrities\" of heaven, like Adam and Moses, who according to Twain become as distant to most people in heaven as living celebrities are on Earth. Twain uses this story to show his view that the common conception of heaven is ludicrous and points out the incongruities of such beliefs.Lots of his usual barbed humor here.   - Summary by phil chenevert and wikipedia", "duration": 5702, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "9", "name": "Mark Twain"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/captainstormfieldsvisittoheavenversion_4_1809_librivox/captainstormfield_1809.jpg", "copyright_year": "0", "genres": ["Humorous Fiction"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Linette Geisel"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Chapter 1", "readers": [5717], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/captainstormfieldsvisittoheavenversion_4_1809_librivox/captainstormfieldsvisittoheaven_01_twain_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2762}, {"section": 2, "title": "Chapter 2", "readers": [5717], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/captainstormfieldsvisittoheavenversion_4_1809_librivox/captainstormfieldsvisittoheaven_02_twain_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2940}]}
