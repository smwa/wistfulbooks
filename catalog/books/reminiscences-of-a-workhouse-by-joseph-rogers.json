{"title": "Reminiscences Of A Workhouse Medical Officer", "description": "Joseph Rogers (1821-1889) was an English physician, medical officer, and health care reformer in London.  The system of poor-law dispensaries and separate sick wards, with proper staffs of medical attendants and nurses, was due to the efforts of Rogers and his colleagues.
