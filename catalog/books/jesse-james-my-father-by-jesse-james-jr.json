{"title": "Jesse James, My Father", "description": "A biography of Jesse James as told by his son, Jesse James, Jr.  We are treated to inside tales of Jesse's childhood and home life; what drove him to become a Confederate guerrilla during the Civil War; his life after the war and how he became a wanted man.  Since it was written by his son, it is a little biased and we are not told anything about any crimes Jesse and his gang committed.  Some of the stories of Jesse's war adventures are a little hard to believe, but a good read nonetheless. - Summary by Barry Eads", "duration": 16804, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "11383", "name": "Jesse James, Jr."}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/jessejames_myfather_1505_librivox/jesse_james_my_father_1505.jpg", "copyright_year": "1899", "genres": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Barry Eads"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Barry Eads"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Barry Eads"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Laura Victoria"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Preface", "readers": [3664], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/jessejames_myfather_1505_librivox/jessejames_00_james_64kb.mp3", "duration": 204}, {"section": 1, "title": "The Death of Jesse James", "readers": [3664], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/jessejames_myfather_1505_librivox/jessejames_01_james_64kb.mp3", "duration": 828}, {"section": 2, "title": "Things I Remember of My Father", "readers": [3664], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/jessejames_myfather_1505_librivox/jessejames_02_james_64kb.mp3", "duration": 598}, {"section": 3, "title": "The James Family", "readers": [3664], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/jessejames_myfather_1505_librivox/jessejames_03_james_64kb.mp3", "duration": 344}, {"section": 4, "title": "The Border Wars", "readers": [3664], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/jessejames_myfather_1505_librivox/jessejames_04_james_64kb.mp3", "duration": 810}, {"section": 5, "title": "Jesse James as a Guerrilla, Part 1", "readers": [3664], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/jessejames_myfather_1505_librivox/jessejames_05_james_64kb.mp3", "duration": 862}, {"section": 6, "title": "Jesse James as a Guerrilla, Part 2", "readers": [3664], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/jessejames_myfather_1505_librivox/jessejames_06_james_64kb.mp3", "duration": 768}, {"section": 7, "title": "Closing Days of the Border Warfare", "readers": [3664], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/jessejames_myfather_1505_librivox/jessejames_07_james_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1012}, {"section": 8, "title": "After the War", "readers": [3664], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/jessejames_myfather_1505_librivox/jessejames_08_james_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1142}, {"section": 9, "title": "Outlawed and Hunted, Part 1", "readers": [3664], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/jessejames_myfather_1505_librivox/jessejames_09_james_64kb.mp3", "duration": 876}, {"section": 10, "title": "Outlawed and Hunted, Part 2", "readers": [3664], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/jessejames_myfather_1505_librivox/jessejames_10_james_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1021}, {"section": 11, "title": "Outlawed and Hunted, Part 3", "readers": [3664], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/jessejames_myfather_1505_librivox/jessejames_11_james_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1286}, {"section": 12, "title": "Jesse James, Jr.", "readers": [3664], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/jessejames_myfather_1505_librivox/jessejames_12_james_64kb.mp3", "duration": 203}, {"section": 13, "title": "The Leeds Hold-up, Part 1", "readers": [3664], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/jessejames_myfather_1505_librivox/jessejames_13_james_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1053}, {"section": 14, "title": "The Leeds Hold-up, Part 2", "readers": [3664], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/jessejames_myfather_1505_librivox/jessejames_14_james_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1095}, {"section": 15, "title": "The Trial for Train Robbery, Part 1", "readers": [3664], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/jessejames_myfather_1505_librivox/jessejames_15_james_64kb.mp3", "duration": 842}, {"section": 16, "title": "The Trial for Train Robbery, Part 2", "readers": [3664], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/jessejames_myfather_1505_librivox/jessejames_16_james_64kb.mp3", "duration": 943}, {"section": 17, "title": "The Trial for Train Robbery, Part 3", "readers": [3664], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/jessejames_myfather_1505_librivox/jessejames_17_james_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1275}, {"section": 18, "title": "The Trial for Train Robbery, Part 4", "readers": [3664], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/jessejames_myfather_1505_librivox/jessejames_18_james_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1294}, {"section": 19, "title": "In Conclusion", "readers": [3664], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/jessejames_myfather_1505_librivox/jessejames_19_james_64kb.mp3", "duration": 348}]}
