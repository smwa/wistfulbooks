{"title": "Oliver Cromwell", "description": "The following work gives within a short compass a history of Oliver Cromwell from a biographical point of view.  The text has been revised by the author.  (From the preface to the 1909 edition)\r\n<br><br>\r\nThis biography considers closely both the actions and the motivations of Oliver Cromwell in the many roles he took on during his life.  Gardiner is careful to put Cromwell into the context of his times -- turbulent, volatile and disorienting -- as the three Kingdoms of the Stuart dynasty were torn by bitter internal strife as well as making war upon each other.  The author gives close attention to how Cromwell navigated the many crises he faced as an individual, as a member of parliament, as an officer in and then commander of the New Model Army, and finally leading the Commonwealth as Lord Protector.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe author, Samuel Rawson Gardiner, was a distinguished English historian who taught and wrote during the Victorian period.  He focused his scholarly work on the history of Britain during the 17th century.  He is regarded as one of the preeminent historians of the period, whose groundbreaking research into sources remains foundational for scholars of the period to the present day.           - Summary by Tom Booker", "duration": 40158, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "17186", "name": "Samuel Rawson Gardiner"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/olivercromwell_2506_librivox/olivercromwell_2506.jpg", "copyright_year": "1909", "genres": ["Biography & Autobiography", "Early Modern"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "tombooker"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "tombooker"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Ann Boulais"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "InTheDesert"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Chapter I:  King and Parliament, Part 1", "readers": [19399], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/olivercromwell_2506_librivox/olivercromwell_01_gardiner_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3418}, {"section": 2, "title": "Chapter I: King and Parliament, Part 2", "readers": [19399], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/olivercromwell_2506_librivox/olivercromwell_02_gardiner_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3499}, {"section": 3, "title": "Chapter II:  The New Model Army and the Presbyterians, Part 1", "readers": [19399], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/olivercromwell_2506_librivox/olivercromwell_03_gardiner_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2950}, {"section": 4, "title": "Chapter II:  The New Model Army and the Presbyterians, Part 2", "readers": [19399], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/olivercromwell_2506_librivox/olivercromwell_04_gardiner_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2502}, {"section": 5, "title": "Chapter III:  The New Model Army and the King, Part 1", "readers": [19399], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/olivercromwell_2506_librivox/olivercromwell_05_gardiner_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3180}, {"section": 6, "title": "Chapter III:  The New Model Army and the King, Part 2", "readers": [19399], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/olivercromwell_2506_librivox/olivercromwell_06_gardiner_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3062}, {"section": 7, "title": "Chapter III:  The New Model Army and the King, Part 3", "readers": [19399], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/olivercromwell_2506_librivox/olivercromwell_07_gardiner_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2080}, {"section": 8, "title": "Chapter IV:  The Last Years of the Long Parliament, Part 1", "readers": [19399], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/olivercromwell_2506_librivox/olivercromwell_08_gardiner_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3141}, {"section": 9, "title": "Chapter IV:  The Last Years of the Long Parliament, Part 2", "readers": [19399], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/olivercromwell_2506_librivox/olivercromwell_09_gardiner_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2688}, {"section": 10, "title": "Chapter V:  The Nominated Parliament and the Protectorate, Part 1", "readers": [19399], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/olivercromwell_2506_librivox/olivercromwell_10_gardiner_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3398}, {"section": 11, "title": "Chapter V:  The Nominated Parliament and the Protectorate, Part 2", "readers": [19399], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/olivercromwell_2506_librivox/olivercromwell_11_gardiner_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2970}, {"section": 12, "title": "Chapter VI:  A Parliamentary Constitution, Part 1", "readers": [19399], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/olivercromwell_2506_librivox/olivercromwell_12_gardiner_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2866}, {"section": 13, "title": "Chapter VI:  A Parliamentary Constitution, Part 2", "readers": [19399], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/olivercromwell_2506_librivox/olivercromwell_13_gardiner_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2733}, {"section": 14, "title": "Chapter VI:  A Parliamentary Constitution, Part 3", "readers": [19399], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/olivercromwell_2506_librivox/olivercromwell_14_gardiner_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1671}]}
