Finney, one of the most influential revivalists of the nineteenth century.  Charles G. Finney was a key figure in initiating the Second Great Awakening in the United States.  His preaching was passionate an powerful and his very presence would often bring conviction on those around him.  Although his background was Baptist and Presbyterian, he vigorously promoted the doctrine of entire sanctification and the infilling of the Holy Spirit.  Finney also left his mark on education as president of Oberlin College in Ohio. - Summary by Larry Wilson", "duration": 26591, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "15123", "name": "Aaron Merritt Hills"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/lifeofcharlesfinney_2104_librivox/lifeofcharlesgfinney_2104.jpg", "copyright_year": "1902", "genres": ["Biography & Autobiography", "Christianity - Other"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Larry Wilson"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Linette Geisel"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Larry Wilson"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Dedication and Preface", "readers": [8425], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/lifeofcharlesfinney_2104_librivox/finney_00_hills_64kb.mp3", "duration": 173}, {"section": 1, "title": "Sent of God", "readers": [14894], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/lifeofcharlesfinney_2104_librivox/finney_01_hills_64kb.mp3", "duration": 810}, {"section": 2, "title": "His Conversion", "readers": [14894], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/lifeofcharlesfinney_2104_librivox/finney_02_hills_64kb.mp3", "duration": 885}, {"section": 3, "title": "Studying Theology", "readers": [14894], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/lifeofcharlesfinney_2104_librivox/finney_03_hills_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1413}, {"section": 4, "title": "Beginning His Ministry", "readers": [14894], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/lifeofcharlesfinney_2104_librivox/finney_04_hills_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1109}, {"section": 5, "title": "Revivals at Antwerp, ''Sodom,'' Gouverneur, and Dekalb", "readers": [14894], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/lifeofcharlesfinney_2104_librivox/finney_05_hills_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1248}, {"section": 6, "title": "Revivals at Wester, Rome, Utica, Auburn, Troy and New Lebanon", "readers": [14894], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/lifeofcharlesfinney_2104_librivox/finney_06_hills_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1171}, {"section": 7, "title": "Ministerial Opposition and the New Lebanon Convention", "readers": [11715], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/lifeofcharlesfinney_2104_librivox/finney_07_hills_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1262}, {"section": 8, "title": "Revivals at Stephentown, Wilmington, Philadelphia and Reading 1827-1830", "readers": [15792], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/lifeofcharlesfinney_2104_librivox/finney_08_hills_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1534}, {"section": 9, "title": "Revivals in Columbia, New York City, Rochester, Auborn, Buffalo, Providence and Boston 1830-1832", "readers": [15792], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/lifeofcharlesfinney_2104_librivox/finney_09_hills_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1852}, {"section": 10, "title": "Labors in New York City, 1832-1835--Trip to Italy--Revival Lectures--Oberlin", "readers": [15792], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/lifeofcharlesfinney_2104_librivox/finney_10_hills_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1408}, {"section": 11, "title": "Early Labors in Oberlin", "readers": [13055], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/lifeofcharlesfinney_2104_librivox/finney_11_hills_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1591}, {"section": 12, "title": "Revivals in Boston--Providence--Rochester, and Again in Boston, 1842-1844--Renewed Baptism with the Holy Ghost--Loss of His Wife", "readers": [7026], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/lifeofcharlesfinney_2104_librivox/finney_12_hills_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1963}, {"section": 13, "title": "First Visit to England--Revivals in Hartford, Western, Syracuse, and Rochester", "readers": [13055], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/lifeofcharlesfinney_2104_librivox/finney_13_hills_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1637}, {"section": 14, "title": "Revivals in Boston--England--Scotland, and Oberlin--Close of His Life", "readers": [13055], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/lifeofcharlesfinney_2104_librivox/finney_14_hills_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1601}, {"section": 15, "title": "Finney on Preachers and Preaching", "readers": [13055], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/lifeofcharlesfinney_2104_librivox/finney_15_hills_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1228}, {"section": 16, "title": "Finney on Freemasonry", "readers": [13055], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/lifeofcharlesfinney_2104_librivox/finney_16_hills_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1599}, {"section": 17, "title": "The Estimate of Finney Made by Others--Finney as a Theologian", "readers": [8142], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/lifeofcharlesfinney_2104_librivox/finney_17_hills_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1483}, {"section": 18, "title": "Finney On Sanctification And Its Results In Oberlin - College History - Closing Pictures", "readers": [8142], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/lifeofcharlesfinney_2104_librivox/finney_18_hills_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2624}]}
