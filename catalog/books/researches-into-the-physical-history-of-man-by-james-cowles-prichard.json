{"title": "Researches into the Physical History of Man", "description": "Prichard\u2019s Researches into the Physical History of Man has been called the most important pre-Darwinian anthropological work in English of the nineteenth century. He is considered by many to be the \"Father of Anthropology\".\r\nThe central conclusion of the work is the unity of the human species, which has been acted upon by causes that have since divided it into permanent varieties or races.\r\nIn his Preface, he writes: \"In the course of this essay I have maintained the opinion that all mankind constitute but one race or proceed from a single family\".\r\nIn this summary passage Prichard indicates Africa (indirectly) as the place of human origin:\r\n\"On the whole, there are many reasons which lead us to the conclusion that the primitive stock of men were probably Negroes, and I know of no argument to be set on the other side.\"\r\nCould this be the first historic recognition that \"Black Lives Matter\"?\r\n\r\nNote: Latin, Greek and German passages recorded by Kazbek.\r\n\r\n(Summary by John Greenman & Wikipedia)", "duration": 56607, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "16933", "name": "James Cowles Prichard"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/researches_into_the_physical_history_of_man_2212_librivox/physical_history_man_2212.jpg", "copyright_year": "1813", "genres": ["Social Science (Culture & Anthropology)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "John Greenman"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "John Greenman"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Availle"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "KHand"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Preface", "readers": [107], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/researches_into_the_physical_history_of_man_2212_librivox/physicalhistoryman_00_prichard_64kb.mp3", "duration": 260}, {"section": 1, "title": "Chapter I -
