Other highlights of this issue include a do-it-yourself guide to fire eating; a behind the scenes tour of a tea plantation in Java to see how green and black teas are made; and, the third part in \"The Story of the American Navy\" in which Congress is reluctant to spend money on a navy but is persuaded to do so by new threats to Americans at home and abroad.
