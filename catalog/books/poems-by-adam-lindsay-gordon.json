{"title": "Poems", "description": "This is a volume of poems by Adam Lindsay Gordon, 'British-born Australian Steeple-Chase Rider and Poet'.<br></br>\"The poems of Gordon have an interest beyond the mere personal one which his friends attach to his name. Written, as they were, at odd times and leisure moments of a stirring and adventurous life, it is not to be wondered at if they are unequal or unfinished. The astonishment of those who knew the man, and can gauge the capacity of this city [Melbourne] to foster poetic instinct, is that such work was ever produced here at all. Intensely nervous, and feeling much of that shame at the exercise of the higher intelligence which besets those who are known to be renowned in field sports, Gordon produced his poems shyly, scribbled them on scraps of paper, and sent them anonymously to magazines. It was not until he discovered one morning that everybody knew a couplet or two of \"How we Beat the Favourite\" that he consented to forego his anonymity and appear in the unsuspected character of a versemaker. The success of his republished \"collected\" poems gave him courage, and the unreserved praise which greeted \"Bush Ballads\" should have urged him to forget or to conquer those evil promptings which, unhappily, brought about his untimely death.' - Summary from the Preface.<br>Note: The dramas (fragment of the Road to Avernus and Ashtaroth) have been left out of this volume.", "duration": 19358,
