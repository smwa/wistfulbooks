{"title": "Undine", "description": "<em>Undine</em> is a novel by Friedrich de la Motte Fouqu\u00e9 concerning Undine, a water spirit who marries a Knight named Huldbrand in order to gain a soul. It is an early German romance, which has been translated into English and other languages. The novel served as inspiration for two operas in the romantic style by Ernst Theodor Amadeus Hoffmann and Albert Lortzing, respectively, and two ballets: the nineteenth century <em>Ondine</em> and the twentieth century <em>Undine</em>. An edition of the book was illustrated by Arthur Rackham. In <em>The Fantastic Imagination</em>, George MacDonald writes, \"Were I asked, what is a fairytale? I should reply, Read Undine: that is a fairytale ... of all fairytales I know, I think Undine the most beautiful.\" (Summary from Wikipedia)", "duration": 11288, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "4725", "name": " Friedrich de la Motte Fouqu\u00e9"}], "coverArt": "https://www.archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt13/Undine_1112.jpg", "copyright_year": "1811", "genres": ["Myths", "Legends & Fairy Tales", "Fantastic Fiction", "Romance"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Pete Williams, Pittsburgh, PA"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Pete Williams, Pittsburgh, PA"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Kristin Hughes"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "HeartofTexas"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Dedication, How The Knight Came To The Fisherman", "readers": [2229], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/undine_pw_librivox/undine_01_fouque_64kb.mp3", "duration": 820}, {"section": 2, "title": "In What Way Undine Had Come to the Fisherman", "readers": [2229], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/undine_pw_librivox/undine_02_fouque_64kb.mp3", "duration": 687}, {"section": 3, "title": "How They Found Undine Again", "readers": [2229], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/undine_pw_librivox/undine_03_fouque_64kb.mp3", "duration": 485}, {"section": 4, "title": "Of That Which the Knight Encountered in the Wood", "readers": [2229], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/undine_pw_librivox/undine_04_fouque_64kb.mp3", "duration": 745}, {"section": 5, "title": "How the Knight Lived on the Little Promontory", "readers": [2229], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/undine_pw_librivox/undine_05_fouque_64kb.mp3", "duration": 573}, {"section": 6, "title": "Of A Nuptial Ceremony", "readers": [2229], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/undine_pw_librivox/undine_06_fouque_64kb.mp3", "duration": 679}, {"section": 7, "title": "What Further Happened on the Evening of the Wedding", "readers": [2229], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/undine_pw_librivox/undine_07_fouque_64kb.mp3", "duration": 383}, {"section": 8, "title": "The Day After the Wedding", "readers": [2229], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/undine_pw_librivox/undine_08_fouque_64kb.mp3", "duration": 700}, {"section": 9, "title": "How the Knight Took His Young Wife with Him", "readers": [2229], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/undine_pw_librivox/undine_09_fouque_64kb.mp3", "duration": 565}, {"section": 10, "title": "How They Lived in the City", "readers": [2229], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/undine_pw_librivox/undine_10_fouque_64kb.mp3", "duration": 476}, {"section": 11, "title": "The Anniversary of Bertalda\u2019s Name-Day", "readers": [2229], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/undine_pw_librivox/undine_11_fouque_64kb.mp3", "duration": 659}, {"section": 12, "title": "How They Departed from the Imperial City", "readers": [2229], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/undine_pw_librivox/undine_12_fouque_64kb.mp3", "duration": 473}, {"section": 13, "title": "How They Lived at Castle Ringstetten", "readers": [2229], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/undine_pw_librivox/undine_13_fouque_64kb.mp3", "duration": 846}, {"section": 14, "title": "How Bertalda Returned Home with the Knight", "readers": [2229], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/undine_pw_librivox/undine_14_fouque_64kb.mp3", "duration": 771}, {"section": 15, "title": "The Journey to Vienna", "readers": [2229], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/undine_pw_librivox/undine_15_fouque_64kb.mp3", "duration": 693}, {"section": 16, "title": "How It Fared Further with Huldbrand", "readers": [2229], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/undine_pw_librivox/undine_16_fouque_64kb.mp3", "duration": 494}, {"section": 17, "title": "The Knight\u2019s Dream", "readers": [2229], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/undine_pw_librivox/undine_17_fouque_64kb.mp3", "duration": 349}, {"section": 18, "title": "How the Knight Huldbrand is Married", "readers": [2229], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/undine_pw_librivox/undine_18_fouque_64kb.mp3", "duration": 561}, {"section": 19, "title": "How the Knight Huldbrand was Buried", "readers": [2229], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/undine_pw_librivox/undine_19_fouque_64kb.mp3", "duration": 329}]}
