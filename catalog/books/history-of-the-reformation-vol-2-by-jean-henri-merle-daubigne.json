{"title": "History of the Reformation in the Sixteenth Century, Volume 2", "description": "The History of the Reformation in the Sixteenth Century, by Jean-Henri Merle d\u2019Aubign\u00e9, is a classic work on the great events that re-opened the Christian gospel to a needy world. The author was a Swiss Protestant pastor. He was also a historian with a great understanding of the Bible, along with a broad and deep knowledge of the Reformation.<br><br>D\u2019Aubign\u00e9 tells the story of outstanding people who had a love for God and his word, and who dared to present biblical truths which had been obscured for centuries. The book has helped and encouraged Christians through difficult times, and given them an understanding of the background from which our freedom in the faith has come.<br><br>This great work is made up of five volumes. The first volume covered the early days, including the call of Martin Luther \u2013 first, from Erfurt University with the prospect of becoming a well-paid lawyer, to become a poor monk. And then, from an obscure monastery, his call to centre stage in world history. One day, while studying in the university library, he had taken down from the shelf a volume that caught his interest. It was a Bible! He was astonished to find in this volume so much more than the fragments of gospels and epistles that were selected for public reading in churches. And it was this discovery, in a dusty university library, of a complete copy of the inspired book from which those readings came, that changed the course of history.<br><br>\nLuther\u2019s story continues in Volume 2, in which we are also introduced to the Swiss reformer, Zwingli. Volume 2 comprises four books which are: Book 5 \u2013 The Discussion of Leipsic, 1519; Book 6 \u2013 The Bull of Rome, 1520; Book 7 \u2013 The Diet of Worms, 1521 (January - May); Book 8 \u2013 The Swiss (1484-1522).Summary by Christopher Smith.", "duration": 53272, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "12414", "name": "Jean-Henri Merle d'Aubign\u00e9"}], "coverArt":
