{"title": "Exposition with Practical Observations upon the Book of Ruth", "description": "Every minister ought to read Matthew Henry entirely and carefully through once at least. You will acquire a vast store of sermons if you read with your note-book close at hand; and as for thoughts, they will swarm around you like twittering swallows around an old gable toward the close of autumn. If you publicly expound the chapter you have just been reading, your people will wonder at the novelty of your remarks and the depth of your thoughts, and then you may tell them what a treasure Henry is. He is most pious and pithy, sound and sensible, suggestive and sober, terse and trustworthy. You will find him to be glittering with metaphors, rich in analogies, overflowing with illustrations, superabundant in reflections. He delights in apposition and alliteration; he is usually plain, quaint, and full of pith; he sees right through a text directly; apparently he is not critical, but he quietly gives the result of an accurate critical knowledge of the original fully up to the best critics of his time. He is not versed in the manners and customs of the East, for the Holy Land was not so accessible as in our day; but he is deeply spiritual, heavenly, and profitable; finding good matter in every text, and from all deducing most practical and judicious lessons. - Summary by Charles Spurgeon", "duration": 7903, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "5793", "name": " Matthew Henry"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/observationsbookofruth_2510_librivox/expositiononruth_2510.jpg", "copyright_year": "1850", "genres": ["Christianity - Commentary"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "InTheDesert"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "InTheDesert"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Barry Eads"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "mleigh"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Introduction", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/observationsbookofruth_2510_librivox/ruth_00_henry_64kb.mp3", "duration": 145}, {"section": 1, "title": "Ruth 1", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/observationsbookofruth_2510_librivox/ruth_01_henry_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2695}, {"section": 2, "title": "Ruth 2", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/observationsbookofruth_2510_librivox/ruth_02_henry_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1971}, {"section": 3, "title": "Ruth 3", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/observationsbookofruth_2510_librivox/ruth_03_henry_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1521}, {"section": 4, "title": "Ruth 4", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/observationsbookofruth_2510_librivox/ruth_04_henry_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1571}]}
