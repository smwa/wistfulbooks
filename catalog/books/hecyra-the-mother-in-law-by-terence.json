{"title": "Hecyra: The Mother-In-Law", "description": "Terence's six plays are comedies written while he was a slave to a Roman senator. NOTE: the main plot elements in Hecyra are quite unacceptable today: Pamphilus has just married a woman he does not recognize that he had earlier raped in a drunken fit; nor does she recognize him. His mistress Bacchis is upset with the marriage and rejects him. He then wanders off, returning only in time to discover his wife with a new child that can't possibly be his. It takes both Mother and Mother-in-Law, and Bacchis, to bring a happy ending out of this confusion.\n - Summary by ToddHW\n<BR><BR>Cast list:<BR>\nLaches, an aged Athenian, father of Pamphilus: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/6754\">ToddHW</a><br>\nPhidippus, an aged Athenian, father of Philumena: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/7170\">alanmapstone</a><br>\nPamphilus, son of Laches: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/10789\">Tomas Peter</a><br>\nSosia, servant of Pamphilus: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/11535\">Nemo</a><br>\nParmeno, servant of Sostrata: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/11417\">Eva Davis</a><br>\nSostrata, wife of Laches: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/6281\">Beth Thomas</a><br>\nMyrrhina, wife of Phidippus: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/11790\">TJ Burns</a><br>\nBacchis, a Courtesan: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/10179\">Sonia</a><br>\nPhilotis, a Courtesan: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/11084\">Devorah Allen</a><br>\nSyra, a Procuress: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/4174\">Availle</a><br>\nStage directions: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/10614\">Leanne Yau</a><br>\nEdited by: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/6754\">ToddHW</a>", "duration": 5464, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "13938", "name": " Terence"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/hecyrathemother-in-law_1903_librivox/hecyra_1903.jpg", "copyright_year": "1896", "genres": ["Classics (Greek & Latin Antiquity)", "Plays"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "ToddHW"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "ToddHW"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Sonia"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Act 1", "readers": [], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/hecyrathemother-in-law_1903_librivox/hecyra_1_terence_64kb.mp3", "duration": 941}, {"section": 2, "title": "Act 2", "readers": [], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/hecyrathemother-in-law_1903_librivox/hecyra_2_terence_64kb.mp3", "duration": 624}, {"section": 3, "title": "Act 3", "readers": [], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/hecyrathemother-in-law_1903_librivox/hecyra_3_terence_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1443}, {"section": 4, "title": "Act 4", "readers": [], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/hecyrathemother-in-law_1903_librivox/hecyra_4_terence_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1914}, {"section": 5, "title": "Act 5", "readers": [], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/hecyrathemother-in-law_1903_librivox/hecyra_5_terence_64kb.mp3", "duration": 542}]}
