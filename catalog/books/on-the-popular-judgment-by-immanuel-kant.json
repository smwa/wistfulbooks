{"title": "On the Popular Judgment: That may be Right in Theory, but does not Hold Good in the Praxis", "description": "This tripartite essay \u2013 published variously as \u201cOn the Popular Judgment\u201d (J. Richardson trans.), \u201cOn the Old Saw\u201d (E.B. Ashton trans.), or \u201cOn the Common Saying\u201d (both M.J. Gregor and H.B. Nisbet) \u2013 Kant takes up the issue of the relation of theory to practice in three distinct ways. In the first, he replies to Christian Garve\u2019s criticism of his moral theory, in the second, he distances himself from Thomas Hobbes, and in the third, Moses Mendelssohn. The three taken together are representative of the breadth of Kant\u2019s moral and political thought; the first section being concerned with the individual, the second with the state, and the third with the species. Although this is, on the whole, a difficult piece to approach, the second and third sections are often read as a way into Kant\u2019s political thought, and serve this purpose well, especially when read alongside his Perpetual Peace.
