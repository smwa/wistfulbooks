He published a wide variety of historical fiction, wilderness and adventure stories and poems, science-fiction, and Sexton Blake boy detective stories. This lovely poem describes what the poet seems to hear the Susquehanna river whispering as it flows by his campsite on a star-lit night. Note: The Susquehanna River flows from upstate New York state to the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland.
