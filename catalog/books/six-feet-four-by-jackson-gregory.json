{"title": "Six Feet Four", "description": "A hotel is robbed one night, and a cowboy makes his getaway with but few witnesses. When a young woman is also robbed, suspicion falls on one particular man who matches the description of the former thief. The robber is without a doubt a tall man; six feet four inches tall. Buck Thornton, at six feet four, in the area, and acting a bit peculiarly, becomes the suspect and sets about to uncover the true culprit. However, what he discovers during his detective work shocks him. Surely it couldn't be? He sets out to capture the thief and clear his name and just maybe prove to the girl who had been robbed that he was innocent of the crime. - Summary by Roger Melin", "duration": 32004, "language":
