{"title": "Brief Account of the Bahai Movement", "description": "\u201cMany believe that we, in this century,\u201d writes Ethel Rosenberg, \u201c are witnessing the dawn of a new spiritual epoch or era. A renewal of the Spirit is making itself felt in the Churches and in the religious and social life of all lands. This is in harmony with the teachings of the Bahais, and of their Great Leaders, now represented by Abdul Baha the \u2018Servant of God,\u2019 known to the outside world as Abbas Effendi. Once again, the Light is shining forth from that land which may indeed be called the Holy Land: for have not its valleys and hills been trodden from the beginning by the feet of those great Messengers inspired of God\u2014Abraham, Elijah, and last and greatest, Jesus of Nazareth? Is it strange that once more in this century of ours, in this \u2018cradle of the race,\u2019 those that were sitting \u201cin darkness have seen a Great Light,\u201d the light of the Sun of Righteousness that rises with healing in his wings?\u201d<br><br>Ethel Jenner Rosenberg (1858-1930) was a prominent British Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed, having been introduced to the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed Faith in 1899 by Mary Thornburgh-Cropper. She published two booklets on the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed Faith, of which \u201cA Brief Account of the Bahai Movement\u201d was one. She also presented a paper on the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed Faith at the International Congress for the History of Religions in 1908. She assisted Laura Clifford Barney in compiling Some Answered Questions and Lady Blomfield in compiling Paris Talks. She began to learn Persian and assisted Shoghi Effendi, the Guardian of the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed Faith, in translating the Hidden Words of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h. She was described by Shoghi Effendi as \u2018England\u2019s pioneer worker\u2019.
