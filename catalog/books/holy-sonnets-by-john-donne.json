{"title": "Holy Sonnets", "description": "John Donne (1572 \u2013 March 31, 1631) was a Jacobean poet and preacher, representative of the metaphysical poets of the period. His works, notable for their realistic and sensual style, include sonnets, love poetry, religious poems, Latin translations, epigrams, elegies, songs, satires and sermons. His poetry is noted for its vibrancy of language and immediacy of metaphor, compared with that of his contemporaries. Towards the end of his life Donne wrote works that challenged death, and the fear that it inspired in many men, on the grounds of his belief that those who die are sent to Heaven to live eternally. One example of this challenge is his Holy Sonnet X, from which come the famous lines \u201cDeath, be not proud, though some have called thee mighty and dreadful, for thou art not so.\u201d (Summary from Wikipedia)", "duration": 1427, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "742", "name": "John Donne"}], "coverArt": "https://www.archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt12/Holy_Sonnets_1110.jpg", "copyright_year": "0", "genres": ["Poetry", "Christianity - Other"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "David Barnes"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "David Barnes"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "David Barnes"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Holy Sonnet I \u2013 Thou hast made me, and shall Thy work decay?", "readers": [94], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/holy_sonnets_drb_librivox/holysonnet_01_donne_64kb.mp3", "duration": 77}, {"section": 2, "title": "Holy Sonnet II \u2013 As due by many titles I resign my self to Thee\u2026", "readers": [94], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/holy_sonnets_drb_librivox/holysonnet_02_donne_64kb.mp3", "duration": 73}, {"section": 3, "title": "Holy Sonnet III \u2013 O might those sighs and tears return again\u2026", "readers": [94], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/holy_sonnets_drb_librivox/holysonnet_03_donne_64kb.mp3", "duration": 74}, {"section": 4, "title": "Holy Sonnet IV \u2013 Oh my black soul! now art thou summoned\u2026", "readers": [94], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/holy_sonnets_drb_librivox/holysonnet_04_donne_64kb.mp3", "duration": 69}, {"section": 5, "title": "Holy Sonnet V \u2013 I am a little world made cunningly\u2026", "readers": [94], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/holy_sonnets_drb_librivox/holysonnet_05_donne_64kb.mp3", "duration": 74}, {"section": 6, "title": "Holy Sonnet VI \u2013 This is my play\u2019s last scene\u2026", "readers": [94], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/holy_sonnets_drb_librivox/holysonnet_06_donne_64kb.mp3", "duration": 82}, {"section": 7, "title": "Holy Sonnet VII \u2013 At the round earth\u2019s imagin\u2019d corners\u2026", "readers": [94], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/holy_sonnets_drb_librivox/holysonnet_07_donne_64kb.mp3", "duration": 75}, {"section": 8, "title": "Holy Sonnet VIII \u2013 If faithful angels be alike glorified\u2026", "readers": [94], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/holy_sonnets_drb_librivox/holysonnet_08_donne_64kb.mp3", "duration": 70}, {"section": 9, "title": "Holy Sonnet IX \u2013 If poisonous minerals\u2026", "readers": [94], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/holy_sonnets_drb_librivox/holysonnet_09_donne_64kb.mp3", "duration": 72}, {"section": 10, "title": "Holy Sonnet X \u2013 Death, be not proud\u2026", "readers": [94], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/holy_sonnets_drb_librivox/holysonnet_10_donne_64kb.mp3", "duration": 79}, {"section": 11, "title": "Holy Sonnet XI \u2013 Spit in my face you Jews\u2026", "readers": [94], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/holy_sonnets_drb_librivox/holysonnet_11_donne_64kb.mp3", "duration": 76}, {"section": 12, "title": "Holy Sonnet XII \u2013 Why are we by all creatures waited on?", "readers": [94], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/holy_sonnets_drb_librivox/holysonnet_12_donne_64kb.mp3", "duration": 74}, {"section": 13, "title": "Holy Sonnet XIII \u2013 What if this present were the world\u2019s last night?", "readers": [94], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/holy_sonnets_drb_librivox/holysonnet_13_donne_64kb.mp3", "duration": 76}, {"section": 14, "title": "Holy Sonnet XIV \u2013 Batter my heart, three-personed God\u2026", "readers": [94], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/holy_sonnets_drb_librivox/holysonnet_14_donne_64kb.mp3", "duration": 78}, {"section": 15, "title": "Holy Sonnet XV \u2013 Wilt thou love God, as he thee?", "readers": [94], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/holy_sonnets_drb_librivox/holysonnet_15_donne_64kb.mp3", "duration": 76}, {"section": 16, "title": "Holy Sonnet XVI \u2013 Father, part of his double interest\u2026", "readers": [94], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/holy_sonnets_drb_librivox/holysonnet_16_donne_64kb.mp3", "duration": 74}, {"section": 17, "title": "Holy Sonnet XVII \u2013 Since she whom I loved hath paid her last debt\u2026", "readers": [94], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/holy_sonnets_drb_librivox/holysonnet_17_donne_64kb.mp3", "duration": 77}, {"section": 18, "title": "Holy Sonnet XVIII \u2013 Show me dear Christ, thy spouse so bright and clear\u2026", "readers": [94], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/holy_sonnets_drb_librivox/holysonnet_18_donne_64kb.mp3", "duration": 77}, {"section": 19, "title": "Holy Sonnet XIX \u2013 Oh, to vex me, contraries meet in one\u2026", "readers": [94], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/holy_sonnets_drb_librivox/holysonnet_19_donne_64kb.mp3", "duration": 74}]}
