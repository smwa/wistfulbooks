Not in the past. Not even, truly, in the present. And yet, Moon\u2019s work does possess a greater degree of finality then he at the time, perhaps, might have credited.\r\n\r\nTHIS IS PART FOUR OF FOUR.\r\nIn the final part, Moon examines the role and viability of small nations within Imperialist world politics as well as trans-Atlantic relations, covers the League of Nations, examines the mandate system including in Syria and Palestine and considers the value of the court of public opinion.\r\n\r\nIt also draws together a set of conclusions which will not be summarized here.\r\n - Summary by Alister", "duration": 16839, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "18119", "name": "Parker Thomas Moon"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/imperialismandworldpoliticspart4of4_2510_librivox/imperialismworldpoliticspt4of4_2510.jpg", "copyright_year": "1926", "genres": ["Political Science", "Modern (19th C)", "Modern (20th C)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Alister"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Alister"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Christine Rottger"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Claudia Caldi"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Chapter 17\u2014Nationalism Versus Imperialism in Europe", "readers": [17571], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/imperialismandworldpoliticspart4of4_2510_librivox/imperialismandworldpoliticspart4of4_01_moon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2384}, {"section": 2, "title": "Chapter 18a\u2014The League and its Mandates\u2014Secret Treaties or Self-Determination", "readers": [17571], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/imperialismandworldpoliticspart4of4_2510_librivox/imperialismandworldpoliticspart4of4_02_moon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1661}, {"section": 3, "title": "Chapter 18b\u2014The League and its Mandates\u2014Establishment of the Mandate System", "readers": [17571], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/imperialismandworldpoliticspart4of4_2510_librivox/imperialismandworldpoliticspart4of4_03_moon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3178}, {"section": 4, "title": "Chapter 18c\u2014The League and its Mandates\u2014Some Defects", "readers": [17571], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/imperialismandworldpoliticspart4of4_2510_librivox/imperialismandworldpoliticspart4of4_04_moon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 960}, {"section": 5, "title": "Chapter 19a\u2014Conclusions\u2014The Measure of Imperialism", "readers": [17571], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/imperialismandworldpoliticspart4of4_2510_librivox/imperialismandworldpoliticspart4of4_05_moon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3677}, {"section": 6, "title": "Chapter 19b\u2014Conclusions\u2014Investing Surplus Capital", "readers": [17571], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/imperialismandworldpoliticspart4of4_2510_librivox/imperialismandworldpoliticspart4of4_06_moon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1277}, {"section": 7, "title": "Chapter 19c\u2014Conclusions\u2014Raw Materials and Imperialism", "readers": [17571], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/imperialismandworldpoliticspart4of4_2510_librivox/imperialismandworldpoliticspart4of4_07_moon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2396}, {"section": 8, "title": "Chapter 19d\u2014Conclusions\u2014The Civilizing Mission", "readers": [17571], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/imperialismandworldpoliticspart4of4_2510_librivox/imperialismandworldpoliticspart4of4_08_moon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1306}]}
