It is a tale of vivid beauty and eery thrills.\r\nFor four centuries a family of French peasants had lived on the edge of this forest in the Vosges Mountains; and now, when the last of the race attacked the trees with fire and ax, the forest struck back. This is a story of graphic action, strange murders and uncanny mystery \u2014 and through it shines the incredible beauty of the Woman of the Wood.  - Summary by Weird Tales Magazine, September 1926", "duration": 4437, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "748", "name": "Abraham Merritt"}], "coverArt": null, "copyright_year": "1926", "genres": ["Horror & Supernatural Fiction", "Fantasy Fiction"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Ben Tucker"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Ben Tucker"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Lynne T"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Christine Rottger"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Part 1", "readers": [16758], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/woman_of_the_woods_2207_librivox/womanofthewood_01_merritt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1083}, {"section": 2, "title": "Part 2", "readers": [16758], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/woman_of_the_woods_2207_librivox/womanofthewood_02_merritt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 677}, {"section": 3, "title": "Part 3", "readers": [16758], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/woman_of_the_woods_2207_librivox/womanofthewood_03_merritt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1120}, {"section": 4, "title": "Part 4", "readers": [16758], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/woman_of_the_woods_2207_librivox/womanofthewood_04_merritt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 883}, {"section": 5, "title": "Part 5", "readers": [16758], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/woman_of_the_woods_2207_librivox/womanofthewood_05_merritt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 674}]}
