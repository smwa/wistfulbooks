{"title": "History and Literature of the Early Church", "description": "This little book in its original form was one of the volumes of the Christian Study Manuals series (1901), and as such was found helpful to many in colleges and elsewhere engaged in the study of early church history. In explanation of its contents it may be stated that the book is based on the extended lectures on early church history given by the author when Professor of Church History in Edinburgh. Although, therefore, necessarily highly condensed, it is believed that few points of importance in the history and literature of the first three centuries have been overlooked, while the practical experience of teaching has enabled the author to throw into due prominence and perspective those aspects of the subject which are of chief moment. - Summary from the Preface", "duration": 20249, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "15498", "name": " James Orr"}], "coverArt": null, "copyright_year": "1913", "genres": ["Antiquity", "Christianity - Biographies"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "InTheDesert"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Amy Gramour"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "InTheDesert"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "The Jewish and Gentile Preparations", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/history_literature_early_church_2310_librivox/historyliteratureearlychurch_01_orr_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1304}, {"section": 2, "title": "The Creative Beginning: Jesus on Kingdom and Church", "readers": [18842], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/history_literature_early_church_2310_librivox/historyliteratureearlychurch_02_orr_64kb.mp3", "duration": 891}, {"section": 3, "title": "The Apostolic Age and Later Jewish Christianity", "readers": [18842], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/history_literature_early_church_2310_librivox/historyliteratureearlychurch_03_orr_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2428}, {"section": 4, "title": "Gentile Christianity: Nero to Domitian (AD 64\u201396)", "readers": [14499], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/history_literature_early_church_2310_librivox/historyliteratureearlychurch_04_orr_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1375}, {"section": 5, "title": "The Age of the Apostolic Fathers (AD 96\u2013117)", "readers": [17576], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/history_literature_early_church_2310_librivox/historyliteratureearlychurch_05_orr_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1653}, {"section": 6, "title": "The Age of the Apologists (AD 117\u2013180)", "readers": [4218], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/history_literature_early_church_2310_librivox/historyliteratureearlychurch_06_orr_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2272}, {"section": 7, "title": "The Age of the Apologists: Gnostiscm and Montanism (AD 117\u2013180)", "readers": [14439], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/history_literature_early_church_2310_librivox/historyliteratureearlychurch_07_orr_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1537}, {"section": 8, "title": "The Age of the Old Catholic Fathers (AD 180\u2013250) Part 1", "readers": [18890], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/history_literature_early_church_2310_librivox/historyliteratureearlychurch_08_orr_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1296}, {"section": 9, "title": "The Age of the Old Catholic Fathers (AD 180\u2013250) Part 2", "readers": [17465], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/history_literature_early_church_2310_librivox/historyliteratureearlychurch_09_orr_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2238}, {"section": 10, "title": "The Age of the Great Persecutions: Victory of Christianity (AD 250\u2013324) Part 1", "readers": [18842], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/history_literature_early_church_2310_librivox/historyliteratureearlychurch_10_orr_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2346}, {"section": 11, "title": "The Age of the Great Persecutions: Victory of Christianity (AD 250\u2013324) Part 2", "readers": [18842], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/history_literature_early_church_2310_librivox/historyliteratureearlychurch_11_orr_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2909}]}
