{"title": "Vegetable; or, From President to Postman", "description": "<i>\"Any man who doesn\u2019t want to get on in the world, to make a million dollars, and maybe even park his toothbrush in the White House, hasn\u2019t got as much to him as a good dog has\u2014he\u2019s nothing more or less than a vegetable.\"</i><br><br>Such is the preface of F. Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s only outing as a playwright. The action begins when 35-year-old railway clerk Jerry Frost gets drunk off a bootlegger\u2019s potent hooch on the eve of Warren G. Harding\u2019s presidential nomination. As a result, the second act takes place entirely within Jerry\u2019s intoxicated fantasies, where he has become the new U.S. President and must deal with an assortment of colorful characters and situations. It is here where comic farce and political satire come to intriguing blows, as Fitzgerald finds opportunities to comment (discreetly or not) on the political climate of his day. When his pseudo-presidency goes all to pieces, Jerry\u2019s fantasy comes crashing down, and as he comes to his senses in the third act, we find that his career aspirations have become decidedly less lofty.<br><br>Though decidedly a minor work from <i>The Great Gatsby</i>\u2019s author, <i>The Vegetable</i> finds him skewering the American Dream\u2019s ethos in ways he would never do again. It\u2019s lighthearted, naughty, irreverent, and does just the trick to escape\u2014even if briefly\u2014from our turbulent times. - Summary by Tomas Peter\n<br><br> Cast List <br>\nJerry Frost: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/10789\">Tomas Peter</a><br>\nCharlotte Frost: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/12506\">Bhavya</a><br>\nHoratio \"Dada\" Frost: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/13022\">Josh Kibbey</a><br>\nDoris: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/12500\">Foon</a><br>\nJoseph Fish: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/7079\">Chuck Williamson</a><br>\nMr. Snooks: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/8879\">Son of the Exiles</a><br>\nMr. Jones: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/11790\">TJ Burns</a><br>\nGeneral Pushing: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/6754\">ToddHW</a><br>\nChief Justice Fossile: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/8576\">Phil Schempf</a><br>\nThe Detective: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/10179\">Sonia</a><br>\nMr. Stutz-Mozart: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/6281\">Beth Thomas</a><br>\nNewsboy / First Senator: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/10614\">Leanne Yau</a><br>\nSecond Senator: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/12623\">Stefan Von Blon</a><br>\nThird Senator: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/13072\">Campbell Schelp</a><br>\n<br>Narrator: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/11084\">Devorah Allen</a><br>\nEditors: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/5796\">Linny</a> and <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/10789\">Tomas Peter</a>", "duration": 10651, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "148", "name": "F.
