{"title": "Woman and Labour", "description": "I should like to say to the men and women of the generations which will come after us\u2014\u201cYou will look back at us with astonishment! You will wonder at passionate struggles that accomplished so little; at the, to you, obvious paths to attain our ends which we did not take; at the intolerable evils before which it will seem to you we sat down passive; at the great truths staring us in the face, which we failed to see; at the truths we grasped at, but could never quite get our fingers round. You will marvel at the labour that ended in so little\u2014but, what you will never know is how it was thinking of you and for you, that we struggled as we did and accomplished the little which we have done; that it was in the thought of your larger realisation and fuller life, that we found consolation for the futilities of our own.\u201d (Summary by Olive Schreiner)", "duration": 24201, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "725", "name": "Olive Schreiner"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/womanandlabour_2211_librivox/womanandlabour_2211.jpg", "copyright_year": "1911", "genres": ["Family & Relationships", "Political Science", "Modern (20th C)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Krista Zaleski"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "J.
