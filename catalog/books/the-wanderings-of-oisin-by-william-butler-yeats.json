{"title": "Wanderings of Oisin", "description": "This narrative poem is composed in three parts, and consists of a dialogue between the aged Irish hero Ois\u00edn and St. Patrick. <br/><br/>\n\nOison relates his three-hundred year sojourn in the immortal isles of Faerie. In the isles, Oison married the beautiful Sidhe Niamh: together they traveled, feasted, and quested. At last Oison succumbs to the temptation to return and visit the lands of mortal men: inadvertently slipping from his faerie horse, his body touches the ground and instantly puts on the flesh of a decrepit old man. <br/><br/>\n\nOison describes various islands and what he did there: contrasting his noble deeds with the degenerate weakness of the present generation. <br/>\n\n(Summary by Godsend)", "duration": 3093, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "335", "name": "William Butler Yeats"}], "coverArt": "https://www.archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt/wanderings_of_oisin.jpg", "copyright_year": "1889", "genres": ["Myths", "Legends & Fairy Tales", "Narratives"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Nathan"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Nathan"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Elizabeth Klett"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Elizabeth Klett"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Book 01", "readers": [3793], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/wanderings_oisin_1001_librivox/thewanderingsofoisin_01_yeats_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1058}, {"section": 2, "title": "Book 02", "readers": [3793], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/wanderings_oisin_1001_librivox/thewanderingsofoisin_02_yeats_64kb.mp3", "duration": 789}, {"section": 3, "title": "Book 03", "readers": [3793], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/wanderings_oisin_1001_librivox/thewanderingsofoisin_03_yeats_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1246}]}
