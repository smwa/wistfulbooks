{"title": "Second Rubaiyat Miscellany", "description": "In 1840 Louisa Stuart Costello published in Fraser\u2019s Magazine an article on classic Persian poetry, which included a section on Omar Khayyam with translations of some verses.\nInterest in the poetry of Omar Khayyam received its first major boost in the English speaking world when Edward Fitzgerald published a translation of 75 quatrains in 1859.  Fitzgerald\u2019s mentor was Professor Edward Byles Cowell, who, in the previous year, had published an essay entitled \u201cOmar Khayyam, the astronomer-poet of Persia\u201d which included translations of thirty quatrains.\nIn 1885 Whitley Stokes, a renowned Irish orientalist and linguist, published an English translation of eighteen quatrains in the journal 'Academy', nr. 663.\nIn the National Review, December, 1890 Charles J. Pickering published a lengthy essay entitled \u201cUmar of Nishapur\u201d,  in which he compared several notable translations including those in English by Fitzgerald and Edward Whinfield and that in German by Von Hammer.\nIn 1896 Nathan Haskell Dole, acting as editor, published the following tome in two volumes: Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam English, French, German, Italian, and Danish translations comparatively  arranged in accordance with the text of Edward Fitzgerald\u2019s version with further selections, notes, biographies, bibliographies and other material. Included in the \u201cfurther selections\u201d are translations of assorted quatrains by Henry George Keene and Frank Siller.\nIn 1901 Dole and Belle Walker published two volumes of \u201cFlowers from Persian Poets.\u201d  The first volume contains a short article about Omar Khayyam and translations of twenty two quatrains by an unknown translator.\nOmar Khayy\u00e1m: some verses and an introduction by W.E.B. Whittaker & R. L\u00f6wenberg, which was published in 1907, contains a short commentary and a translation of fifty-three quatrains by the authors.\nThis recording is a sequel to <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/rubaiyat_miscellany_1311_librivox\">A Rubaiyat Miscellany</a>, published by Librivox on 28th November, 2013\n\n\n - Summary by Algy Pug", "duration": 10691, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "13067", "name": "Louisa Stuart Costello"}, {"id": "13069", "name": "Edward Byles Cowell"}, {"id": "3315", "name": "Nathan Haskell Dole"}, {"id": "13071", "name": "Henry George Keene"}, {"id": "13075", "name": "R.
