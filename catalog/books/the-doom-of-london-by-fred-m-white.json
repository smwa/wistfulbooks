{"title": "Doom of London", "description": "Here are six stories, each one describing a disaster afflicting London, that were popularly serialized during 1903-1904 in Pearson\u2019s Magazine. The tales depict (1) a deep freeze and unprecedented snowfall; (2) a heavy, blinding, paralyzing blanket of fog; (3) a widespread killer virus; (4) a fraudulent scheme causing financial panic; (5) a minor electrical accident in a tunnel that spirals into catastrophe; and (6) most of the city\u2019s water supply, reportedly contaminated with deadly bubonic bacillus, puts the population in great fear of plague. Is the word \u201cdoom\u201d in the book's title accurate, or is it just hyperbole? (Lee Smalley)", "duration": 16049, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "299", "name": "Fred M.
