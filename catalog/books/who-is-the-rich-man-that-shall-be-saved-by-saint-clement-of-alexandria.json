{"title": "Who is the Rich Man That Shall Be Saved?", "description": "This short treatise by St. Clement's is an exposition on the words of Jesus Christ to the young rich man, recounted in the gospels. In the account, the man asks Jesus what he must do to inherit eternal life. First, Jesus advises the man to obey the commandments, then Jesus adds: \"If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.\" However, when he heard this, \"he became very sorrowful because he was very wealthy. Jesus looked at him and said, 'How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of heaven! Indeed, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven.'\" Does this mean that every Christian should give away their goods and become poor? St. Clement, an important Christian figure of the 2nd century, clarifies exactly what was meant by Christ. - Summary by ancientchristian", "duration": 4952, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "8393", "name": "Saint Clement of Alexandria"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/whoistherichmanthatshallbesaved_2010_librivox/who_rich_man_2010.jpg", "copyright_year": "0", "genres": ["Christianity - Commentary"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "ancientchristian"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "ancientchristian"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "InTheDesert"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Chapters I-X", "readers": [14072], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/whoistherichmanthatshallbesaved_2010_librivox/whoistherichmanthatshallbesaved_01_clementofalexandria_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1129}, {"section": 2, "title": "Chapters XI-XXI", "readers": [14072], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/whoistherichmanthatshallbesaved_2010_librivox/whoistherichmanthatshallbesaved_02_clementofalexandria_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1242}, {"section": 3, "title": "Chapters XXII-XXXI", "readers": [14072], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/whoistherichmanthatshallbesaved_2010_librivox/whoistherichmanthatshallbesaved_03_clementofalexandria_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1139}, {"section": 4, "title": "Chapters XXXII-XLII", "readers": [14072], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/whoistherichmanthatshallbesaved_2010_librivox/whoistherichmanthatshallbesaved_04_clementofalexandria_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1442}]}
