{"title": "Confessions of a Daddy", "description": "The wry humor of Ellis Parker Butler, who gave us the classic Pigs Is Pigs, takes us into his own married life where Marthy and Hiram live quietly in their Colorado town. They don't have trouble with anyone of their neighbors. Why should they, as they don't have any kids that could cause the neighbors trouble? And oh, luckily they don't have kids because how could Hiram otherwise afford to give his wife, Marthy a new silk dress? Really lucky. The neighbors kids are cute and all but ugh, they are much better off without kids and their expenses and sicknesses and trouble. Except that one boy, well, he's cool, Hiram wouldn't mind having him around and teaching him how to fish. Or maybe the neighbors youngest daughter, shes so nice. All of this superiority changes when they expect a child of their own and then the poor little thing is born. Funny, poignant and oh, so true!
