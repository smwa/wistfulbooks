{"title": "Golden Age", "description": "The Golden Age is a collection of reminiscences of childhood, written by Kenneth Grahame and originally published in book form in 1895, in London by The Bodley Head, and in Chicago by Stone & Kimball. (The Prologue and six of the stories had previously appeared in the National Observer, the journal then edited by William Ernest Henley.) Widely praised upon its first appearance\u2014Algernon Charles Swinburne, writing in the Daily Chronicle, called it \u201cone of the few books which are well-nigh too praiseworthy for praise\u201d\u2014the book has come to be regarded as a classic in its genre. <br /><br />Typical of his culture and his era, Grahame casts his reminiscences in imagery and metaphor rooted in the culture of Ancient Greece; to the children whose impressions are recorded in the book, the adults in their lives are \u201cOlympians,\u201d while the chapter titled \u201cThe Argonauts\u201d refers to Perseus, Apollo, Psyche, and similar figures of Greek mythology. Grahame\u2019s reminiscences, in The Golden Age and in the later Dream Days (1898), were notable for their conception \u201cof a world where children are locked in perpetual warfare with the adult \u2018Olympians\u2019 who have wholly forgotten how it feels to be young\u201d\u2014a theme later explored by J. M. Barrie and other authors.
