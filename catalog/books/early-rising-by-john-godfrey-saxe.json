{"title": "Early Rising", "description": "LibriVox volunteers bring you 15 recordings of Early Rising by John Godfrey Saxe. This was the Fortnightly Poetry project for December 31, 2010.<br><br>The words \"dutiful\" and \"pious\" never applied to the aspiring satirist. Bored by his legal work, Saxe began publishing poems for The Knickerbocker, of which \"The Rhyme of the Rail\" is his most famous early work. He soon caught the attention of the prominent Boston publishing house, Ticknor and Fields. Though he received no royalties for his first volume, it ran to ten reprintings and eventually outsold works by Hawthorne and Tennyson.", "duration": 2587, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "1154", "name": "John Godfrey Saxe"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt28/Early_Rising_1301.jpg", "copyright_year": "1912", "genres": ["Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Early Rising - Read by BC", "readers": [5987], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/early_rising_1101_librivox/earlyrising_saxe_bc_64kb.mp3", "duration": 141}, {"section": 2, "title": "Early Rising - Read by CC", "readers": [4586], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/early_rising_1101_librivox/earlyrising_saxe_cc_64kb.mp3", "duration": 165}, {"section": 3, "title": "Early Rising - Read by DL", "readers": [2911], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/early_rising_1101_librivox/earlyrising_saxe_dl_64kb.mp3", "duration": 188}, {"section": 4, "title": "Early Rising - Read by DRB", "readers": [94], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/early_rising_1101_librivox/earlyrising_saxe_drb_64kb.mp3", "duration": 180}, {"section": 5, "title": "Early Rising - Read by GHS", "readers": [4705], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/early_rising_1101_librivox/earlyrising_saxe_ghs_64kb.mp3", "duration": 177}, {"section": 6, "title": "Early Rising - Read by JC", "readers": [5937], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/early_rising_1101_librivox/earlyrising_saxe_jc_64kb.mp3", "duration": 142}, {"section": 7, "title": "Early Rising - Read by JCM", "readers": [3470], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/early_rising_1101_librivox/earlyrising_saxe_jcm_64kb.mp3", "duration": 190}, {"section": 8, "title": "Early Rising - Read by JM", "readers": [4697], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/early_rising_1101_librivox/earlyrising_saxe_jm_64kb.mp3", "duration": 203}, {"section": 9, "title": "Early Rising - Read by JSK", "readers": [5668], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/early_rising_1101_librivox/earlyrising_saxe_jsk_64kb.mp3", "duration": 166}, {"section": 10, "title": "Early Rising - Read by LAH", "readers": [1212], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/early_rising_1101_librivox/earlyrising_saxe_lah_64kb.mp3", "duration": 173}, {"section": 11, "title": "Early Rising - Read by LED", "readers": [5962], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/early_rising_1101_librivox/earlyrising_saxe_led_64kb.mp3", "duration": 165}, {"section": 12, "title": "Early Rising - Read by LLW", "readers": [4738], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/early_rising_1101_librivox/earlyrising_saxe_llw_64kb.mp3", "duration": 194}, {"section": 13, "title": "Early Rising - Read by ND", "readers": [2628], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/early_rising_1101_librivox/earlyrising_saxe_nd_64kb.mp3", "duration": 176}, {"section": 14, "title": "Early Rising - Read by TG", "readers": [3157], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/early_rising_1101_librivox/earlyrising_saxe_tg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 173}, {"section": 15, "title": "Early Rising - Read by WT", "readers": [5694], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/early_rising_1101_librivox/earlyrising_saxe_wt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 154}]}
