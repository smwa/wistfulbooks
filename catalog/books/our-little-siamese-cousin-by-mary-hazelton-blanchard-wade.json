{"title": "Our Little Siamese Cousin", "description": "A book written for children to see what life is like for their 'cousins' in Siam.   This is part of the \"Our Little Cousin\" series and like the others, brings to life the day to day occurrences and celebrations of children around the world that are so different, yet at heart, all the same because children and the parents who love and cherish them are the same too no matter where they live.   This book lets us attend some of their Siamese festivals, take a peep into the royal palace, enter the temples, and learn something about the ways and habits of that far-away eastern country.  - Summary by Phil Chenevert", "duration": 5532, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "9754", "name": "Mary Hazelton Blanchard Wade"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/ourlittlesiamesecousin_1501_librivox/our_little_siamese_1501.jpg", "copyright_year": "1903", "genres": ["General"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "bandbw123"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Preface", "readers": [8677], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ourlittlesiamesecousin_1501_librivox/ourlittlesiamesecousin_00_wade_64kb.mp3", "duration": 125}, {"section": 1, "title": "The First Birthday", "readers": [8677], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ourlittlesiamesecousin_1501_librivox/ourlittlesiamesecousin_01_wade_64kb.mp3", "duration": 803}, {"section": 2, "title": "Little Chie Lo", "readers": [7495], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ourlittlesiamesecousin_1501_librivox/ourlittlesiamesecousin_02_wade_64kb.mp3", "duration": 615}, {"section": 3, "title": "Night on the River", "readers": [7495], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ourlittlesiamesecousin_1501_librivox/ourlittlesiamesecousin_03_wade_64kb.mp3", "duration": 622}, {"section": 4, "title": "Work and Play", "readers": [8721], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ourlittlesiamesecousin_1501_librivox/ourlittlesiamesecousin_04_wade_64kb.mp3", "duration": 619}, {"section": 5, "title": "New Year's", "readers": [9092], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ourlittlesiamesecousin_1501_librivox/ourlittlesiamesecousin_05_wade_64kb.mp3", "duration": 270}, {"section": 6, "title": "White Elephants", "readers": [7756], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ourlittlesiamesecousin_1501_librivox/ourlittlesiamesecousin_06_wade_64kb.mp3", "duration": 319}, {"section": 7, "title": "In the Temple", "readers": [7850], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ourlittlesiamesecousin_1501_librivox/ourlittlesiamesecousin_07_wade_64kb.mp3", "duration": 318}, {"section": 8, "title": "The Legend of the Peace-Offering", "readers": [7850], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ourlittlesiamesecousin_1501_librivox/ourlittlesiamesecousin_08_wade_64kb.mp3", "duration": 463}, {"section": 9, "title": "Queer Sights", "readers": [7756], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ourlittlesiamesecousin_1501_librivox/ourlittlesiamesecousin_09_wade_64kb.mp3", "duration": 613}, {"section": 10, "title": "The Queen's City", "readers": [7756], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ourlittlesiamesecousin_1501_librivox/ourlittlesiamesecousin_10_wade_64kb.mp3", "duration": 363}, {"section": 11, "title": "The Monsoon", "readers": [7756], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ourlittlesiamesecousin_1501_librivox/ourlittlesiamesecousin_11_wade_64kb.mp3", "duration": 402}]}
