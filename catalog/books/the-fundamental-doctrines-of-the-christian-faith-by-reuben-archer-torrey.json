{"title": "Fundamental Doctrines of the Christian Faith", "description": "We were having a great many accessions to our church.  While many of these came by letter form other churches, many of them were new converts and had had practically no systematic instruction in the fundamental truths of the Christina faith, so we announced a series of sermons on The Fundamental Doctrines of the Christian Faith.  There was immediately a large increase in the attendance at the services where these addresses were given, and this increase has kept up until on the last Lord's Day we had much the largest attendance we have ever had, excepting Easter Sunday. Many have testified to the blessing received form these sermons, and there has been a great demand that the sermons be printed for general circulation.  It is hoped that this volume will be useful to other pastors in suggesting lines of teaching in their regular pastoral work, and also that it may be used widely by pastors and others for circulation among Christians.  We live in a day in which many of our church members are all at sea as to what they believe on the fundamental doctrines of the Christian faith.  These sermons have already helped many through their delivery.  It is hoped they will reach and help far more in the printed form.  (R. A. Torrey)", "duration": 28144, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "12529", "name": "Reuben Archer Torrey"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/librivoxcdcoverart34/fundamentals_1710.jpg", "copyright_year": "1918", "genres": ["Christianity - Commentary"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "MaryAnn"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "MaryAnn"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "MaryAnn"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Devorah Allen"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Preface", "readers": [3645], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/fundamentaldoctrines_1709_librivox/fundamentaldoctrines_00_torrey_64kb.mp3", "duration": 134}, {"section": 1, "title": "Inspiration, or To What Extent is the Bible Inspired of God?", "readers": [3645], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/fundamentaldoctrines_1709_librivox/fundamentaldoctrines_01_torrey_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2302}, {"section": 2, "title": "The Christian Conception of God, or the God of the Bible as Distinguished from the God of Christian Science and the God of Modern Philosophy", "readers": [3645], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/fundamentaldoctrines_1709_librivox/fundamentaldoctrines_02_torrey_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1636}, {"section": 3, "title": "The Christian Conception of God--The Infinite Perfection and Unity of God", "readers": [3645], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/fundamentaldoctrines_1709_librivox/fundamentaldoctrines_03_torrey_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1598}, {"section": 4, "title": "The Diety of Jesus Christ", "readers": [3645], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/fundamentaldoctrines_1709_librivox/fundamentaldoctrines_04_torrey_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1841}, {"section": 5, "title": "Jesus Christ a Real Man", "readers": [3645], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/fundamentaldoctrines_1709_librivox/fundamentaldoctrines_05_torrey_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1725}, {"section": 6, "title": "The Personality of the Holy Spirit", "readers": [3645], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/fundamentaldoctrines_1709_librivox/fundamentaldoctrines_06_torrey_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2703}, {"section": 7, "title": "The Diety of the Holy Spirit and the Distinction Between the Father, Son and Holy Spirit", "readers": [3645], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/fundamentaldoctrines_1709_librivox/fundamentaldoctrines_07_torrey_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1494}, {"section": 8, "title": "The Atonement: God's Doctrine of the Atonement vs. Unitarian and Christian Science Doctrines of the Atonement", "readers": [3645], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/fundamentaldoctrines_1709_librivox/fundamentaldoctrines_08_torrey_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2118}, {"section": 9, "title": "The Distinctive Doctrine of Protestantism: Justification by Faith", "readers": [3645], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/fundamentaldoctrines_1709_librivox/fundamentaldoctrines_09_torrey_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1764}, {"section": 10, "title": "The New Birth", "readers": [3645], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/fundamentaldoctrines_1709_librivox/fundamentaldoctrines_10_torrey_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1682}, {"section": 11, "title": "Sanctification", "readers": [3645], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/fundamentaldoctrines_1709_librivox/fundamentaldoctrines_11_torrey_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1786}, {"section": 12, "title": "The Resurrection of the Body of Jesus and of Our Bodies", "readers": [3645], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/fundamentaldoctrines_1709_librivox/fundamentaldoctrines_12_torrey_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1636}, {"section": 13, "title": "The Devil", "readers": [3645], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/fundamentaldoctrines_1709_librivox/fundamentaldoctrines_13_torrey_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1810}, {"section": 14, "title": "Is There a Literal Hell?", "readers": [3645], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/fundamentaldoctrines_1709_librivox/fundamentaldoctrines_14_torrey_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1668}, {"section": 15, "title": "Is Future Punishment Everlasting?", "readers": [3645], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/fundamentaldoctrines_1709_librivox/fundamentaldoctrines_15_torrey_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2247}]}
