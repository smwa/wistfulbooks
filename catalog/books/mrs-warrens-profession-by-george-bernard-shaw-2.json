{"title": "Mrs. Warren's Profession", "description": ".Mrs. Warren's Profession is a play written by George Bernard Shaw in 1893, and first performed in London in 1902 but was banned after two performances because of the profession talked about.   The play is about a former prostitute, now a madam (brothel proprietor), who attempts to come to terms with her disapproving daughter. It illustrates Shaw's belief that the act of prostitution was not caused by moral failure but by economic necessity.  It also has a lot to say about the hypocrisy of English society that profited from many despised and illegal professions and used people in despicable ways but pretended to look down on them.  This was probably why it was banned, not because of the 'profession' of Mrs. Warren, but because it exposed very highly placed people doing nasty things to make money.      - Summary by phil chenevert and Wikipedia", "duration": 10254, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "603", "name": "George Bernard Shaw"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/mrswarrensprofession_1812_librivox/mrs_warren_1812.jpg", "copyright_year": "0", "genres": ["Satire"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Linette Geisel"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Act I", "readers": [5717], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/mrswarrensprofession_1812_librivox/mrswarrensprofession_01_shaw_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2411}, {"section": 2, "title": "Act II", "readers": [5717], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/mrswarrensprofession_1812_librivox/mrswarrensprofession_02_shaw_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3051}, {"section": 3, "title": "Act III", "readers": [5717], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/mrswarrensprofession_1812_librivox/mrswarrensprofession_03_shaw_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2163}, {"section": 4, "title": "Act IV", "readers": [5717], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/mrswarrensprofession_1812_librivox/mrswarrensprofession_04_shaw_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2629}]}
