{"title": "Bible (KJV) NT 08: 2 Corinthians", "description": "The Second Epistle of Paul to the Corinthians, often referred to as Second Corinthians (and written as 2 Corinthians), is the eighth book of the New Testament. The letter, originally written in Koine Greek, is from Paul of Tarsus (and Timothy) to the Christians of Corinth, Greece.<br/><br/>\nPaul defends his authority as an apostle. He also states the importance of forgiving others, and God\u2019s new agreement that comes from the Spirit of the living God (2 Cor. 3:3), and the importance of being a person of Christ and giving generously to God\u2019s people in Jerusalem, and ends with his own experience of how God changed his life.
