{"title": "Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions", "description": "<i>Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions</i> is an 1884 science fiction novella by the English schoolmaster Edwin Abbott Abbott. As a satire, <i>Flatland</i> offered pointed observations on the social hierarchy of Victorian culture. However, the novella's more enduring contribution is its examination of dimensions; in a foreword to one of the many publications of the novella, noted science writer Isaac Asimov described <i>Flatland</i> as \"The best introduction one can find into the manner of perceiving dimensions.\" As such, the novella is still popular amongst mathematics, physics and computer science students.
