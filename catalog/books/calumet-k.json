{"title": "Calumet \u201cK\u201d", "description": "\"A novel, with several elements of rather unusual interest. As a tale, it is swift, simple, and absorbing, and one does not willingly put it down until it is finished. It has to do with grain-elevator business, with railways, strikes, and commercial and financial matters generally, woven skillfully into a human story of love.\" --<i>The Commercial Advertiser</i><br /><br />\n\"'Calumet \"K\"' is a novel that is exciting and absorbing, but not the least bit sensational. It is the story of a rush.... The book is an unusually good story; one that shows the inner workings of the labor union, and portrays men who are the bone and sinew of the earth.\"--<i>The Toledo Blade</i>.<br /><br />\n\"The heroine in this case is the hero's stenographer; but the action of the story grows out of the attempt of rival capitalists and grain men to balk the building of a grain elevator by a set date.\" --<i>The Burlington Free Press</i><br /><br />\n(Excerpts from the advertising material at the end of \"<a href=\"http://librivox.org/the-merry-anne-by-samuel-merwin/\">The Merry Anne</a>\" by Samuel Merwin)<<br /><br />\n<i>Note: This book contains racial comments that may be offensive to modern listeners.</i>", "duration": 21991, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "796", "name": "Samuel Merwin"}, {"id": "894", "name": "Henry Kitchell Webster"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt23/calumet_k_1210.jpg", "copyright_year": "1901", "genres": ["Action & Adventure Fiction", "General Fiction", "Romance"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Betsie Bush"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Betsie Bush"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Annise"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Brenda Price"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Chapter 01", "readers": [32], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/calumet_k_1006_librivox/calumet-k_01_merwin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1297}, {"section": 2, "title": "Chapter 02", "readers": [32], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/calumet_k_1006_librivox/calumet-k_02_merwin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1125}, {"section": 3, "title": "Chapter 03", "readers": [32], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/calumet_k_1006_librivox/calumet-k_03_merwin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 916}, {"section": 4, "title": "Chapter 04", "readers": [32], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/calumet_k_1006_librivox/calumet-k_04_merwin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 970}, {"section": 5, "title": "Chapter 05", "readers": [32], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/calumet_k_1006_librivox/calumet-k_05_merwin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2151}, {"section": 6, "title": "Chapter 06", "readers": [32], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/calumet_k_1006_librivox/calumet-k_06_merwin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1378}, {"section": 7, "title": "Chapter 07", "readers": [32], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/calumet_k_1006_librivox/calumet-k_07_merwin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 988}, {"section": 8, "title": "Chapter 08", "readers": [32], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/calumet_k_1006_librivox/calumet-k_08_merwin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1364}, {"section": 9, "title": "Chapter 09", "readers": [32], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/calumet_k_1006_librivox/calumet-k_09_merwin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 899}, {"section": 10, "title": "Chapter 10", "readers": [32], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/calumet_k_1006_librivox/calumet-k_10_merwin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1050}, {"section": 11, "title": "Chapter 11", "readers": [32], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/calumet_k_1006_librivox/calumet-k_11_merwin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1306}, {"section": 12, "title": "Chapter 12", "readers": [32], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/calumet_k_1006_librivox/calumet-k_12_merwin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1419}, {"section": 13, "title": "Chapter 13", "readers": [32], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/calumet_k_1006_librivox/calumet-k_13_merwin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1506}, {"section": 14, "title": "Chapter 14", "readers": [32], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/calumet_k_1006_librivox/calumet-k_14_merwin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1640}, {"section": 15, "title": "Chapter 15", "readers": [32], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/calumet_k_1006_librivox/calumet-k_15_merwin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1410}, {"section": 16, "title": "Chapter 16", "readers": [32], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/calumet_k_1006_librivox/calumet-k_16_merwin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1196}, {"section": 17, "title": "Chapter 17", "readers": [32], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/calumet_k_1006_librivox/calumet-k_17_merwin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1376}]}
