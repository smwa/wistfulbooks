{"title": "Silver Blaze", "description": "A famous race horse disappears a week before an important race; the trainer is found dead on the desolate moor and the police are completely baffled.  Naturally the owner and the police turn to Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson to help unravel the tangled threads of this mystery. Which he does in his usual imaginative and yet logical way.  I think this is one of the best Sherlock stories by Doyle.   We are given the clues and yet cannot see them until Sherlock slowly puts them together. Very enjoyable.   - Summary by phil chenevert", "duration": 3540, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "467", "name": "Sir Arthur Conan Doyle"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/silverblaze_2205_librivox/silverblaze_2005.jpg", "copyright_year": "0", "genres": ["Crime & Mystery Fiction", "Detective Fiction"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "KevinS"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Part 1", "readers": [5717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/silverblaze_2205_librivox/silverblaze_01_doyle_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2044}, {"section": 2, "title": "Part 2", "readers": [5717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/silverblaze_2205_librivox/silverblaze_02_doyle_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1496}]}
