{"title": "Faces and Places", "description": "<em>Faces and Places</em> is a collection of articles on nineteenth century travel, events and personalities by the British journalist Henry Lucy, who wrote for the Daily News, a London newspaper. His open letter <em>To Those About to Become Journalists</em> rings as true today as when it was written.<br /><br />The first article, <em>\"Fred\" Burnaby</em>, includes a lively account of a balloon trip, while <em>Night and Day on the Cars in Canada</em> and <em>Easter on Les Avants</em> relate Lucy's experiences of rail travel at that time. Other travel tales (<em>A Night on a Mountain</em>, <em>Mosquitoes and Monaco</em>, and <em>Oysters and Arcachon</em>) provide an insight into the Victorian Englishman's attitude to Europe.<br /><br />Three of the pieces, <em>With Peggotty and Ham</em>, <em>A Cinque Port</em> and <em>Christmas Eve at Watts's</em>, concern the county of Kent, where Lucy had a country house. <em>Christmas Eve at Watts's</em> contains an interesting expos\u00e9 of Dickens' short story <em>The Seven Poor Travellers</em>.<br /><br />Other articles are of historical interest: <em>A Wreck in the North Sea</em> is an account of the wreck of the ship \"Deutschland\" in 1875; <em>A Historic Crowd</em> describes the massive popular interest in the 1871 trial of the Tichborne Claimant; <em>The Battle of Merthyr</em> contains an eye-witness account of the Merthyr Riots of 1831; <em>The Prince of Wales</em> paints a portrait of the future King Edward VII.<br /><br />Lucy, who also wrote as \"Toby, M.P.\" for the satirical magazine Punch, loved to poke gentle fun, particularly at the establishment, and this is especially evident in <em>A Peep at an Old House of Commons</em> and <em>Some Preachers I Have Known</em>.<br /><br />This eclectic collection, mostly affectionately humorous, but with moments of great pathos, was originally published in 1892 in The Whitefriars Library of Wit & Humour.(Summary by Ruth Golding)", "duration": 25151, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "1092", "name": "Sir Henry W.
