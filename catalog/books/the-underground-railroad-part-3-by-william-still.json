{"title": "Underground Railroad, Part 3", "description": "\"Never before has the working of the Underground Railroad been so thoroughly explained. Here we have in complete detail the various methods adopted for circumventing the enemies of freedom, and told, as it is, with great simplicity and natural feeling, the narrative is one which cannot but make a deep impression. Thrilling incidents, heroic adventures and noble deeds of self-sacrifice light up every page, and will enlist the heartiest sympathies of all generous souls. It was eminently just that such a record of one of the most remarkable phases of the struggle against slavery should be prepared, that the memory of the noble originators and supporters of the railroad might be kept green, and posterity enabled to form a true conception of the necessity that called it into existence, and of the difficulties under which its work was performed. The labor of compiling could not have fallen into more appropriate or better qualified hands.\" The Philadelphia Inquirer  <br><br>William Still is often called the Father of the Underground Railroad.  Over 14 years, he helped hundreds of slaves escape to freedom in Canada.  Still was committed to preserving the stories of the bondmen and he kept careful records of the many escaped slaves who passed through the Philadelphia \u201cstation\u201d.  The Underground Railroad was published in 1871 from Still\u2019s records and diaries.  In bringing you these stories, Librivox volunteers are reading from the 1878 edition.
