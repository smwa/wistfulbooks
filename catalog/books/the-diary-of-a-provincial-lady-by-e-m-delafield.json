{"title": "Diary of a Provincial Lady", "description": "\u201cNotice, and am gratified by, large clump of crocuses near the front gate. Should like to make whimsical and charming reference to these and try to fancy myself as \u2018Elizabeth of the German Garden\u2019, but am interrupted by Cook, saying that the Fish is here, but he\u2019s only bought cod and haddock, and the haddock doesn\u2019t smell any too fresh, so what about cod? Have often noticed that Life is like that.\u201d\r\n\r\nFirst published in 1930, this charming, funny book is a warm portrait of a middle-class English family and their village life. Our heroine recounts the mundane delights and disasters of her household, dealing with constant money worries, the challenges of finding & keeping a really good parlourmaid, and how best to retain grace towards her fellow humans in the face of their astonishing range of foibles. It\u2019s also a wonderfully genuine description of a marriage, with all the little ups and downs of rubbing along with the same person for so many years.
