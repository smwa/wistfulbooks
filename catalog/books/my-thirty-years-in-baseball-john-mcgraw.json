{"title": "My Thirty Years In Baseball", "description": "The autobiography of John Joseph McGraw, another one of the \"greats\" of baseball.  McGraw, along with Casey Stengel, has managed the most league pennants, with ten. He also holds the NL record for seasons managed, with 31 (thirty with the Giants and one with the original Orioles). He is third among major league managers in wins with 2,763, behind Connie Mack and Tony La Russa, though, at .586, McGraw's winning percentage as a manager is about .050 higher than La Russa's and .100 higher than Mack's. This book tells, in his own words, the hows and whys of his remarkable career, from player to manager. - Summary by cavaet", "duration": 22037, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "17007", "name": "John McGraw"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/my_thirty_years_in_baseball_2209_librivox/30yearsbaseball_2209.jpg", "copyright_year": "1923", "genres": ["Biography & Autobiography", "Sports & Recreation"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Cavaet"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Cavaet"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "DaveC"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "EliseDee"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Introduction by George M.
