Her first collection of poems, Sonnets to Duse and Other Poems, was published that same year.\n<br />\nTeasdale's second collection, Helen of Troy and Other Poems, was published in 1911.[2] It was well received by critics, who praised its lyrical mastery and romantic subject matter.<br />\nTeasdale's third poetry collection, Rivers to the Sea, was published in 1915. It was and is a bestseller, being reprinted several times.<br />\n\nIn 1918 she won a Pulitzer Prize for her 1917 poetry collection Love Songs.
