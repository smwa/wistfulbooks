{"title": "Raggedy Ann and Andy and the Camel with the Wrinkled Knees", "description": "Raggedy Ann, you remember, always thought lovely kindly thoughts because there was a little candy heart with the words \"I love you\" printed on it sewed, up in her nice cotton stuffed body. So of course she is the pleasantest sort of a rag dolly to become acquainted with or to meet again if you are already acquainted. This is the third book in which Raggedy Ann's exciting adventures are told, and Johnny Gruelle, her creator has long ago made her a classic in the child's world. Her brother Raggedy Andy is almost as famous.<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn this tale the two of them set out to rescue the French doll from kidnappers. They are joined by the camel with wrinkled knees and a tired old horse. After that there certainly are doings - with witches and pirates, a fairy princess, the King of the Loonies, and everything. The child's library will be greatly enriched by this rollicking tale of lovable Raggedy Ann and her friends.
