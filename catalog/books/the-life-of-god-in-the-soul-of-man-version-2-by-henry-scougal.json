{"title": "Life of God in the Soul of Man (Version 2)", "description": "\u201cIn many ways we are still living in the spiritual momentum that was created during the Great Awakening\u2026and in the midst of the Great Awakening there was one man that was most singularly used by God\u2026that man was the great evangelist, George Whitefield.\u201d (Steven J. Lawson)<br /><br />Published in 1677, <i>The Life of God in the Soul of Man</i> was originally penned in 1676 as a private letter to a friend by 26 year-old Henry Scougal, professor of divinity at King\u2019s College, University of Aberdeen. Less than a century later, this short yet rich spiritual classic, which expresses Scougal\u2019s theology of \u201ctrue religion\u201d and its excellencies and advantages, made its way through the hands of Susanna Wesley and her son Charles, to one George Whitefield. And upon reading, Whitefield later commented that: \u201cI never knew what true religion was till God sent me this excellent treatise.\u201d A discourse that was instrumental in the conversion of a man such as Whitefield is one that all Christ-followers would do well to consider. And upon reflection, readers will be fanning into flame that life of God within their own souls. (Introduction by M.
