{"title": "Sight Unseen", "description": "A medium is brought to a neighborhood social club gathering as the evening's entertainment and describes someone who had been shot, and some of the surrounding circumstances. Later in the evening two of the attendees are called away to a nearby house where there has been a violent death which oddly mirrors what the medium described. They and later the Club as a whole decide to try to find out what really happened. This novella is both a mystery and a social comedy, like many of Mary Roberts Rinehart\u2019s writings.
