{"title": "Heretics", "description": "The Author Gilbert Keith Chesterton was born in London, England on the 29th of May, 1874. Though he considered himself a mere \"rollicking journalist,\" he was actually a prolific and gifted writer in virtually every area of literature. A man of strong opinions and enormously talented at defending them, his exuberant personality nevertheless allowed him to maintain warm friendships with people--such as George Bernard Shaw and H. G. Wells--with whom he vehemently disagreed. Chesterton had no difficulty standing up for what he believed. He was one of the few journalists to oppose the Boer War. His 1922 \"Eugenics and Other Evils\" attacked what was at that time the most progressive of all ideas, the idea that the human race could and should breed a superior version of itself. In the Nazi experience, history demonstrated the wisdom of his once \"reactionary\" views.<br /><br />\nChesterton wrote several works of Christian apologetics, the best known of which are \"Orthodoxy\", \"Heretics\", and \"The Everlasting Man\".
