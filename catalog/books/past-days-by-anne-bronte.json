{"title": "Past Days", "description": "LibriVox volunteers bring you 12 recordings of Past Days by Emily Bront\u00eb . This was the Weekly Poetry project for November 28th, 2010<br><br>Anne Bront\u00eb was a British novelist and poet, the youngest member of the Bront\u00eb literary family. She wrote a volume of poetry with her sisters (Poems by Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell, 1846) and in short succession she wrote two novels. Agnes Grey, based upon her experiences as a governess, was published in 1847. Her second and last novel, The Tenant of Wildfell Hall appeared in 1848. Anne's life was cut short with her death of pulmonary tuberculosis when she was 29 years old. She published under the androgynous pen name Acton Bell. (summary by Wikipedia)\n\nPlease note, at the time of this poetry project, the Gutenburg index was mis-interpreted and this poem was mistakenly attributed to Emily Bront\u00eb / Ellis Bell. The recorded LibriVox introductions will reflect this mistake.</p>", "duration": 1225, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "172", "name": "Anne Bront\u00eb"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt23/Past_Days_1210.jpg", "copyright_year": "1846", "genres": ["Poetry", "Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Past Days - Read by ALG", "readers": [4744], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/pastdays_1012_librivox/pastdays_bronte_alg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 83}, {"section": 2, "title": "Past Days - Read by DL", "readers": [2911], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/pastdays_1012_librivox/pastdays_bronte_dl_64kb.mp3", "duration": 102}, {"section": 3, "title": "Past Days - Read by DRB", "readers": [94], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/pastdays_1012_librivox/pastdays_bronte_drb_64kb.mp3", "duration": 118}, {"section": 4, "title": "Past Days - Read by EB", "readers": [5850], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/pastdays_1012_librivox/pastdays_bronte_eb_64kb.mp3", "duration": 93}, {"section": 5, "title": "Past Days - Read by GB", "readers": [4969], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/pastdays_1012_librivox/pastdays_bronte_gb_64kb.mp3", "duration": 100}, {"section": 6, "title": "Past Days - Read by GC", "readers": [5754], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/pastdays_1012_librivox/pastdays_bronte_gc_64kb.mp3", "duration": 94}, {"section": 7, "title": "Past Days - Read by GHS", "readers": [4705], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/pastdays_1012_librivox/pastdays_bronte_ghs_64kb.mp3", "duration": 96}, {"section": 8, "title": "Past Days - Read by JOC", "readers": [4015], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/pastdays_1012_librivox/pastdays_bronte_joc_64kb.mp3", "duration": 115}, {"section": 9, "title": "Past Days - Read by LAH", "readers": [1212], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/pastdays_1012_librivox/pastdays_bronte_lah_64kb.mp3", "duration": 112}, {"section": 10, "title": "Past Days - Read by LLW", "readers": [4738], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/pastdays_1012_librivox/pastdays_bronte_llw_64kb.mp3", "duration": 109}, {"section": 11, "title": "Past Days - Read by RVB", "readers": [5285], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/pastdays_1012_librivox/pastdays_bronte_rvb_64kb.mp3", "duration": 101}, {"section": 12, "title": "Past Days - Read by SKO", "readers": [5867], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/pastdays_1012_librivox/pastdays_bronte_sko_64kb.mp3", "duration": 102}]}
