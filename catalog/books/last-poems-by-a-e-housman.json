{"title": "Last Poems", "description": "\"I publish these poems, few though they are, because it is not likely that I shall ever be impelled to write much more. I can no longer expect to be revisited by the continuous excitement under which in the early months of 1895 I wrote the greater part of my first book, nor indeed could I well sustain it if it came; and it is best that what I have written should be printed while I am here to see it through the press and control its spelling and punctuation. About a quarter of this matter belongs to the April of the present year, but most of it to dates between 1895 and 1910.\n\nSeptember 1922\" - Summary by Preface ", "duration": 2979, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "1173", "name": "A.
