{"title": "Holy in Christ", "description": "In introducing this book, which Andrew Murray sub-titled \u201cThoughts on the Calling of God\u2019s Children to Be Holy as He is Holy\u201d,  I can do no better than to quote from the author\u2019s own Preface: \u201cIt has been my earnest desire that I might be a helper of the faith of my brethren in seeking to trace with them the wondrous revelation of God\u2019s Holiness through the ages as recorded in His blessed Word. It has been my continual prayer that God might use what is written to increase in His children the conviction that we must be holy, the knowledge of how we are to be holy, the joy that we may be holy, the faith that we can be holy. And may He stir us all to cry day and night to Him for a visitation of the Spirit and the Power of Holiness upon all His people, that the name of Christian and of saint may be synonymous, and every believer be a vessel made holy and meet for the Master\u2019s use.\u201d - Summary by Christopher Smith, quoting Andrew Murray", "duration": 30653, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "2839",
