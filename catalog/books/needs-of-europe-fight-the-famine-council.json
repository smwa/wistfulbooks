{"title": "Needs of Europe, Its Economic Reconstruction", "description": "In October 1920, the International Economic Conference in London gathered invitees to review post-war Europe's ravaged economies. Speakers included economists and representatives from various European aid and reconstruction groups. The talks offered a mix: some presented data on production and inflation, while others detailed the widespread misery of disease, famine, and poverty. The conference aimed to identify areas for relief or economic stimulation. The book's modern value lies in its depiction of the enormous economic and social devastation caused by four years of war. - Summary by Ted Lienhart", "duration": 22336, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "19428", "name": " Fight the Famine Council"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/needsofeurope_2601_librivox/needsofeurope_2601.jpg", "copyright_year": "1921", "genres": ["War & Military", "Business & Economics", "Modern (20th C)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Ted Lienhart"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Ted Lienhart"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "DaveC"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Rapunzelina"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Introductory Note", "readers": [17965], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/needsofeurope_2601_librivox/needsofeurope_00_thefightthefaminecouncil_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1355}, {"section": 1, "title": "The Purpose of the Conference", "readers": [17965], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/needsofeurope_2601_librivox/needsofeurope_01_thefightthefaminecouncil_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1883}, {"section": 2, "title": "National Expenditure", "readers": [17965], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/needsofeurope_2601_librivox/needsofeurope_02_thefightthefaminecouncil_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1866}, {"section": 3, "title": "Jugo-Slavia: Obstacles to Reconstruction", "readers": [17965], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/needsofeurope_2601_librivox/needsofeurope_03_thefightthefaminecouncil_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1140}, {"section": 4, "title": "Problems of Coal, Transport, and Raw Material", "readers": [17965], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/needsofeurope_2601_librivox/needsofeurope_04_thefightthefaminecouncil_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1640}, {"section": 5, "title": "The Coal Problem", "readers": [17965], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/needsofeurope_2601_librivox/needsofeurope_05_thefightthefaminecouncil_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1785}, {"section": 6, "title": "Emergency Measures of International Finance in Relation to Reconstruction", "readers": [17965], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/needsofeurope_2601_librivox/needsofeurope_06_thefightthefaminecouncil_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1897}, {"section": 7, "title": "Financial Reconstruction", "readers": [17965], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/needsofeurope_2601_librivox/needsofeurope_07_thefightthefaminecouncil_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1599}, {"section": 8, "title": "The Case of Armenia", "readers": [17965], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/needsofeurope_2601_librivox/needsofeurope_08_thefightthefaminecouncil_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1804}, {"section": 9, "title": "Palestine", "readers": [17965], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/needsofeurope_2601_librivox/needsofeurope_09_thefightthefaminecouncil_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1151}, {"section": 10, "title": "The Reconstruction of Europe", "readers": [17965], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/needsofeurope_2601_librivox/needsofeurope_10_thefightthefaminecouncil_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1923}, {"section": 11, "title": "Obstacles to Reform", "readers": [17965], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/needsofeurope_2601_librivox/needsofeurope_11_thefightthefaminecouncil_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1705}, {"section": 12, "title": "How to Make the League of Nations an Effective Instrument for Reconstruction", "readers": [17965], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/needsofeurope_2601_librivox/needsofeurope_12_thefightthefaminecouncil_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1604}, {"section": 13, "title": "An International House of Commons", "readers": [17965], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/needsofeurope_2601_librivox/needsofeurope_13_thefightthefaminecouncil_64kb.mp3", "duration": 984}]}
