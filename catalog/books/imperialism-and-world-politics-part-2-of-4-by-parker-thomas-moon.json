{"title": "Imperialism and World Politics, Part 2 of 4", "description": "Moon\u2019s I\u1d0d\u1d18\u1d07\u0280\u026a\u1d00\u029f\u026as\u1d0d \u1d00\u0274\u1d05 W\u1d0f\u0280\u029f\u1d05 P\u1d0f\u029f\u026a\u1d1b\u026a\u1d04s is perhaps the best-known work of the Columbia University professor and political scientist; It was published in 1926 and did not go out-of-print until at least 1940. \u201cWhat convenient volume,\u201d he asks, exists as a \u201cgeneral account of the greater imperialism of our own times?\u201d A question which was suitably answered by the publication of this sweeping survey of the field. \r\n\r\n\r\nWritten in what would prove to be the gathering twilight of European imperialism, and with the inclination towards reflection that only the aftermath of a great catastrophe like the First World War can evoke, this work spans the globe and follows behind Great Britain, France, Belgium, Italy, Russia, Germany, Japan and the United States as they shaped world politics to their own ends\u2014imposing their will on states, economies and peoples.\r\n\r\n\r\nMoon writes of his work that, \u201cIt can make no claim to finality.\u201d Indeed, this is surely not the last word on the subject. Not in the past. Not even, truly, in the present. And yet, Moon\u2019s work does possess a greater degree of finality then he at the time, perhaps, might have credited. \r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS IS PART TWO OF FOUR.\r\n\r\nIn this part, Moon starts by briefly covering the Anglo-German contention over East Africa, French designs on the island of Madagascar and Italy\u2019s foray into the Horn of Africa to establish the colony of \u2018Somaliland\u2019. \r\n\r\nHis telling then reaches \u201ca natural sequel\u2026 to events which have unfolded themselves in preceding chapters.\u201d The jealous contest over Abyssinia and Sudan. For \u201cnowhere did visions of empire struggle for mastery with a greater intensity of conflict or a more colourful wealth of spectacular incident.\u201d \r\n\r\nAs Moon tellingly remarks, \u201cImperialism is rarely active against a formidable foe.\u201d Britain conquered an Egypt riven by civil war in 1882\u2014just in time to be sucked into the budding jihad in Sudan waged in defence of the Arab slave trade and in rejection of khedival rule. The British response to the Mahdists went from feckless to quite feeble. Unwilling to act themselves after a string of embarrassing disasters, Britain sought simply \u2013 for a decade-and-a-half \u2013 to play Italian ambitions off against French designs.\r\n\r\nThis precipitated the dramatic events of the First Italo-Abyssinian War, and French largess in training and munitions conferred upon Menelik\u2019s forces helped to tip the scales\u2014toward a decisive Italian defeat.\r\n\r\nMoon next profiles Cecil Rhodes and takes us into South Africa. Next into the violence and cunning which abided in Europe\u2019s near abroad, the \u201csmiling and temperate coastlands\u201d of North Africa, where France, Spain, Italy, Germany and Britain squabble over pounds of Ottoman, Algerian and Moroccan flesh.\r\n\r\nFinally, this part concludes with a survey of Near Eastern \u2018Questions\u2019 and, also, an exploration of the anxiety that Russia\u2019s creeping southward expansion exercised on the British halls of power, and its effects on India\u2019s periphery. \r\n - Summary by Alister", "duration": 24037, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "18119", "name": "Parker Thomas Moon"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/imperialismandworldpoliticspart2of4_2409_librivox/imperialismworldpoliticspart2_2409.jpg", "copyright_year": "1926", "genres": ["War & Military", "Political Science", "Modern (19th C)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Alister"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Alister"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Barry Eads"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Claudia Caldi"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Chapter 07\u2014The Conquest and Exploitation of East Africa", "readers": [17571], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/imperialismandworldpoliticspart2of4_2409_librivox/imperialismworldpoliticspart2_01_moon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2283}, {"section": 2, "title": "Chapter 08\u2014A Climax\u2014In the Sudan", "readers": [17571], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/imperialismandworldpoliticspart2of4_2409_librivox/imperialismworldpoliticspart2_02_moon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3063}, {"section": 3, "title": "Chapter 09a\u2014The Legacy of Cecil Rhodes\u2014Diamonds and Gold", "readers": [17571], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/imperialismandworldpoliticspart2of4_2409_librivox/imperialismworldpoliticspart2_03_moon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1967}, {"section": 4, "title": "Chapter 09b\u2014The Legacy of Cecil Rhodes\u2014The Jameson Raid", "readers": [17571], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/imperialismandworldpoliticspart2of4_2409_librivox/imperialismworldpoliticspart2_04_moon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2075}, {"section": 5, "title": "Chapter 10a\u2014North Africa and the Great Powers\u2014Avenging an Insult\u2014Algeria", "readers": [17571], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/imperialismandworldpoliticspart2of4_2409_librivox/imperialismworldpoliticspart2_05_moon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1400}, {"section": 6, "title": "Chapter 10b\u2014North Africa and the Great Powers\u2014Inevitable Necessity in Morocco", "readers": [17571], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/imperialismandworldpoliticspart2of4_2409_librivox/imperialismworldpoliticspart2_06_moon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3018}, {"section": 7, "title": "Chapter 10c\u2014North Africa and the Great Powers\u2014Italy's Vital Interest in Libia", "readers": [17571], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/imperialismandworldpoliticspart2of4_2409_librivox/imperialismworldpoliticspart2_07_moon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2717}, {"section": 8, "title": "Chapter 11a\u2014Near Eastern Questions Old and New\u2014Two Near Eastern Questions", "readers": [17571], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/imperialismandworldpoliticspart2of4_2409_librivox/imperialismworldpoliticspart2_08_moon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1697}, {"section": 9, "title": "Chapter 11b\u2014Near Eastern Questions Old and New\u2014The Bosnian Crisis", "readers": [17571], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/imperialismandworldpoliticspart2of4_2409_librivox/imperialismworldpoliticspart2_09_moon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1441}, {"section": 10, "title": "Chapter 11c\u2014Near Eastern Questions Old and New\u2014War and Peace", "readers": [17571], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/imperialismandworldpoliticspart2of4_2409_librivox/imperialismworldpoliticspart2_10_moon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1873}, {"section": 11, "title": "Chapter 12\u2014Anglo-Russian Rivalry in the Middle East", "readers": [17571], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/imperialismandworldpoliticspart2of4_2409_librivox/imperialismworldpoliticspart2_11_moon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2503}]}
