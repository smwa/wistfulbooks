Set in England during the early 1200s, the scion of a Western Marches noble family relates the many encounters and battles that he faces with the Saxon yeoman who becomes his fast friend. This yeoman, great of cross-bow skill and strategy, often saves the day, and after earning knighthood, becomes instrumental in the making of the Magna Carta. - Summary by Lynette Caulkins", "duration": 21301, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "14502", "name": "Bernard Gay Marshall"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/librivoxcdcoverart36/cedrictheforester_2002.jpg", "copyright_year": "1921", "genres": ["Action & Adventure Fiction", "Culture & Heritage Fiction", "Historical Fiction"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Lynette Caulkins"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Lynette Caulkins"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "DaveC"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Linette Geisel"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "I - The Siege of Castle Mountjoy - part 1", "readers": [13661], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/cedric_the_forester_2002_librivox/cedrictheforester_01_marshall_64kb.mp3", "duration": 521}, {"section": 2, "title": "I - The Siege of Castle Mountjoy - part 2", "readers": [13661], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/cedric_the_forester_2002_librivox/cedrictheforester_02_marshall_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1651}, {"section": 3, "title": "II - The Tapping on the Dungeon Wall", "readers": [13661], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/cedric_the_forester_2002_librivox/cedrictheforester_03_marshall_64kb.mp3", "duration": 875}, {"section": 4, "title": "III - Cedric the Forester", "readers": [13661], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/cedric_the_forester_2002_librivox/cedrictheforester_04_marshall_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1453}, {"section": 5, "title": "IV - The Champion of Mountjoy", "readers": [13661], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/cedric_the_forester_2002_librivox/cedrictheforester_05_marshall_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1612}, {"section": 6, "title": "V - The Festival of the Archers", "readers": [13661], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/cedric_the_forester_2002_librivox/cedrictheforester_06_marshall_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1606}, {"section": 7, "title": "VI - Wolf's Head Glen", "readers": [13661], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/cedric_the_forester_2002_librivox/cedrictheforester_07_marshall_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1845}, {"section": 8, "title": "VII - The Outlaws of Blackpool", "readers": [13661], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/cedric_the_forester_2002_librivox/cedrictheforester_08_marshall_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1377}, {"section": 9, "title": "VIII - The Fortress of the Monkslayer", "readers": [13661], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/cedric_the_forester_2002_librivox/cedrictheforester_09_marshall_64kb.mp3", "duration": 691}, {"section": 10, "title": "IX - Churl and Overlord", "readers": [13661], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/cedric_the_forester_2002_librivox/cedrictheforester_10_marshall_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1804}, {"section": 11, "title": "X - The Pass of the Eagles", "readers": [13661], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/cedric_the_forester_2002_librivox/cedrictheforester_11_marshall_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1837}, {"section": 12, "title": "XI - By Kimberley Moat", "readers": [13661], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/cedric_the_forester_2002_librivox/cedrictheforester_12_marshall_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1447}, {"section": 13, "title": "XII - The Iron Collar", "readers": [13661], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/cedric_the_forester_2002_librivox/cedrictheforester_13_marshall_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1984}, {"section": 14, "title": "XIII - On the Road to Runnymede - part 1", "readers": [13661], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/cedric_the_forester_2002_librivox/cedrictheforester_14_marshall_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1144}, {"section": 15, "title": "XIII - On the Road to Runnymede - part 2", "readers": [13661], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/cedric_the_forester_2002_librivox/cedrictheforester_15_marshall_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1454}]}
