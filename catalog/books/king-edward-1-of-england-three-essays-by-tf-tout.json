{"title": "King Edward I of England: Three Essays", "description": "Edward I (1239 \u2013 1307), was King of England from 1272 to 1307.   The eldest son of Henry III, Edward was involved from an early age in the political intrigues of his father's reign.  Edward spent much of his reign reforming royal administration and common law.  After suppressing a minor conflict in Wales in 1276\u201377, Edward responded to a second one in 1282\u201383 by conquering  Wales. Edward's temperamental nature and height (6'2\") made him an intimidating figure. He often instilled fear in his contemporaries, although he held the respect of his subjects for the way he embodied the medieval ideal of kingship as a soldier, an administrator and a man of faith,   Edward established Parliament as a permanent institution, which allowed for a functional system for raising taxes and reforming the law through statutes.  The author was a professor of mediaeval and ecclesiastical history in the University of Manchester. - Summary by Wikipedia and David Wales", "duration": 6291, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "12261", "name": "Thomas Frederick Tout"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/king_edward_1_of_england_three_essays_2312_librivox/kingedwardI_2312.jpg", "copyright_year": "1915", "genres": ["Biography & Autobiography", "Essays & Short Works", "Middle Ages/Middle History"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "David Wales"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "David Wales"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "DaveC"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "DaveC"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Part 1: A Medieval Burglary - Section 1", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/king_edward_1_of_england_three_essays_2312_librivox/kingedward1_01_tout_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1861}, {"section": 2, "title": "Part 1: A Medieval Burglary - Section 2", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/king_edward_1_of_england_three_essays_2312_librivox/kingedward1_02_tout_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1595}, {"section": 3, "title": "Part 2: The Conquest and Settlement of the Principality of Wales\u20141274-1301", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/king_edward_1_of_england_three_essays_2312_librivox/kingedward1_03_tout_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1502}, {"section": 4, "title": "Part 3: The End of the Reign\u20141305-1307", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/king_edward_1_of_england_three_essays_2312_librivox/kingedward1_04_tout_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1333}]}
