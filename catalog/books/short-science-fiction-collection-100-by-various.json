{"title": "Short Science Fiction Collection 100", "description": "Librivox has officially contributed a whopping 100 of these numbered collections of science fiction short stories!  To celebrate, we are doing something a little special with this one.  All stories included in this deluxe edition of the Short Sci-Fi Collection are at least 100 years old!  We thought it would be a great idea to celebrate the expansive genre of science fiction by going back to its early years and experiencing the kinds of stories that molded one of the most imaginative, forward-looking genres of fiction while also reminding us that a tale well told is not limited to a specific time or place.  So join us at Librivox as we blast off into a glorious past that influenced where we have been and where we are going! - Summary by Ben Tucker", "duration": 46486, "language": "English", "authors":
