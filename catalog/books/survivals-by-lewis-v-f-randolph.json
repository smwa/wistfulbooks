{"title": "Survivals", "description": "The unique poetry of Lewis V.F. Randolph is brilliantly brought to life in this wide-ranging collection of some of his best work. A businessman by profession and poet by avocation, Randolph developed his unique perspective on life from both the practicality of an entrepreneur and the creativity of a writer. This perspective is skillfully enhanced and deftly interpreted in these poems, which illustrate both the poet's quest for meaning, \"Ah, life is all so like this turbid stream! / And frowning walls hem our imperilled path\", and his carefully considered assertions of worldly sagacity, \"But, from its source, each drop bears wisest scheme: / Peace wakes at last from fitful dreams of wrath\".\r\n\r\nRandolph writes of the wonders of nature, the glory of God's creation, and our place in a perplexing but uplifting universe. In keeping with the overall theme of the book, Randolph acknowledges the ephemeral nature of this life and the common journey on which we find ourselves, suggesting, \"Live in the present; for 't is all thou hast;\" and counselling us to \"Use every moment as it were thy last!\".\r\n\r\n - Summary by Bruce Kachuk", "duration": 5638, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "18705", "name": "Lewis V.
