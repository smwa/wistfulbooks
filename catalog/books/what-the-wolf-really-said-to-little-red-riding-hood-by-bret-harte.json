{"title": "What the Wolf Really Said to Little Red Riding Hood", "description": "Francis Bret Harte was an American author and poet, best remembered for his short fiction featuring miners, gamblers, and other romantic figures of the California Gold Rush. In a career spanning more than four decades, he wrote poetry, fiction, plays, lectures, book reviews, editorials, and magazine sketches in addition to fiction. As he moved from California to the eastern U.S. to Europe, he incorporated new subjects and characters into his stories, but his Gold Rush tales have been most often reprinted, adapted, and admired.  - Summary by Wikipedia", "duration": 1222, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "40", "name": "Bret Harte"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/whatthewolfreallysaid_150_librivox/little_red_riding_hood_1502.jpg", "copyright_year": "1902", "genres": ["Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "What the Wolf Really Said to Little Red Riding Hood - Read by CCS", "readers": [8337], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/whatthewolfreallysaid_150_librivox/whatthewolf_harte_ccs_64kb.mp3", "duration": 104}, {"section": 2, "title": "What the Wolf Really Said to Little Red Riding Hood - Read by DB", "readers": [9515], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/whatthewolfreallysaid_150_librivox/whatthewolf_harte_db_64kb.mp3", "duration": 101}, {"section": 3, "title": "What the Wolf Really Said to Little Red Riding Hood - Read by DL", "readers": [2911], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/whatthewolfreallysaid_150_librivox/whatthewolf_harte_dl_64kb.mp3", "duration": 85}, {"section": 4, "title": "What the Wolf Really Said to Little Red Riding Hood - Read by EZWA", "readers": [123], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/whatthewolfreallysaid_150_librivox/whatthewolf_harte_ezwa_64kb.mp3", "duration": 99}, {"section": 5, "title": "What the Wolf Really Said to Little Red Riding Hood - Read by GB", "readers": [4969], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/whatthewolfreallysaid_150_librivox/whatthewolf_harte_gb_64kb.mp3", "duration": 92}, {"section": 6, "title": "What the Wolf Really Said to Little Red Riding Hood - Read by GG", "readers": [8011], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/whatthewolfreallysaid_150_librivox/whatthewolf_harte_gg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 111}, {"section": 7, "title": "What the Wolf Really Said to Little Red Riding Hood - Read by GLM", "readers": [9732], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/whatthewolfreallysaid_150_librivox/whatthewolf_harte_glm_64kb.mp3", "duration": 73}, {"section": 8, "title": "What the Wolf Really Said to Little Red Riding Hood - Read by JAB", "readers": [9825], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/whatthewolfreallysaid_150_librivox/whatthewolf_harte_jab_64kb.mp3", "duration": 87}, {"section": 9, "title": "What the Wolf Really Said to Little Red Riding Hood - Read by LAH", "readers": [1212], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/whatthewolfreallysaid_150_librivox/whatthewolf_harte_lah_64kb.mp3", "duration": 83}, {"section": 10, "title": "What the Wolf Really Said to Little Red Riding Hood - Read by LCW", "readers": [8425], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/whatthewolfreallysaid_150_librivox/whatthewolf_harte_lcw_64kb.mp3", "duration": 102}, {"section": 11, "title": "What the Wolf Really Said to Little Red Riding Hood - Read by LLW", "readers": [4738], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/whatthewolfreallysaid_150_librivox/whatthewolf_harte_llw_64kb.mp3", "duration": 111}, {"section": 12, "title": "What the Wolf Really Said to Little Red Riding Hood - Read by MK", "readers": [8051], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/whatthewolfreallysaid_150_librivox/whatthewolf_harte_mk_64kb.mp3", "duration": 88}, {"section": 13, "title": "What the Wolf Really Said to Little Red Riding Hood - Read by SGT", "readers": [8805], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/whatthewolfreallysaid_150_librivox/whatthewolf_harte_sgt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 86}]}
