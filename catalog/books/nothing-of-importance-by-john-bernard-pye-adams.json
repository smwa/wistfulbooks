{"title": "Nothing of Importance", "description": "Fighting in France during the Great War, Bernard Adams, an officer with a Welsh battalion, was moved to chronicle what he saw and experienced: the living conditions and duties of officers and \u201cTommies\u201d (enlisted men) in their dank, rat-infested trenches and behind the lines; the maiming and deaths; and the quiet periods described in official reports as \u201cnothing of importance\u201d. Adams relates his wounding in June, 1916 and its aftermath. The concluding chapter, which he wrote during his convalescence in \u201cBlighty\u201d (soldiers\u2019 slang for England), is an impassioned reflection on war. Following several months of recuperation Adams returned to the front where, on February 26, 1917 he was wounded again. The following day he died.
