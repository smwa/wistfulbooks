{"title": "Guide to Health", "description": "Mahatma Gandhi, known today as a fascinating political leader and pacifist, also considered himself \"something of an authority on matters of Health and Disease as well. Very few of us perhaps are aware that he is the author of quite an original little Health-book in Gujarati. [...] His views are of course radically different from the ordinary views that find expression in the pages of such books; in many cases, indeed, his doctrines must be pronounced revolutionary, and will doubtless be regarded by a certain class of readers as wholly impracticable. Even the most revolutionary of his doctrines, however, are based, not on the shifting quicksands of mere theory, but on the solid foundation of deep study, backed up by personal experience of nearly thirty years. He himself recognizes that many of his views will hardly be accepted by the ordinary reader, but he has felt himself impelled by a stern sense of duty to give publicity to his convictions formed after so much of study and experience\" (Preface).\n\nThough his advice may appear socially outdated or medically obvious/dubious to his modern day audience based on what we know now, Gandhi's treatise still provides a fascinating look on maintaining good health as it was understood in the early twentieth century. - Summary by Mary Kay and A.
