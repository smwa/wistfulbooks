{"title": "Wish", "description": "Samuel Rogers was an English poet, during his lifetime one of the most celebrated, although his fame has long since been eclipsed by his Romantic colleagues and friends Wordsworth, Coleridge and Byron. His recollections of these and other friends such as Charles James Fox are key sources for information about London artistic and literary life, with which he was intimate, and which he used his wealth to support. He made his money as a banker and was also a discriminating art collector. - Summary by Wikipedia", "duration": 1418, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "2126", "name": "Samuel Rogers"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/a_wish_1809.poem_librivox/wish_1809.jpg", "copyright_year": "1814", "genres": ["Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "David Lawrence"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "A Wish - Read by BK", "readers": [8786], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/a_wish_1809.poem_librivox/wish_rogers_bk_64kb.mp3", "duration": 77}, {"section": 2, "title": "A Wish - Read by DL", "readers": [2911], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/a_wish_1809.poem_librivox/wish_rogers_dl_64kb.mp3", "duration": 69}, {"section": 3, "title": "A Wish - Read by EC", "readers": [12536], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/a_wish_1809.poem_librivox/wish_rogers_ec_64kb.mp3", "duration": 79}, {"section": 4, "title": "A Wish - Read by EL", "readers": [9872], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/a_wish_1809.poem_librivox/wish_rogers_el_64kb.mp3", "duration": 73}, {"section": 5, "title": "A Wish - Read by FH", "readers": [12500], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/a_wish_1809.poem_librivox/wish_rogers_fh_64kb.mp3", "duration": 62}, {"section": 6, "title": "A Wish - Read by GG", "readers": [8011], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/a_wish_1809.poem_librivox/wish_rogers_gg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 73}, {"section": 7, "title": "A Wish - Read by GRS", "readers": [12484], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/a_wish_1809.poem_librivox/wish_rogers_grs_64kb.mp3", "duration": 69}, {"section": 8, "title": "A Wish - Read by HYP", "readers": [12737], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/a_wish_1809.poem_librivox/wish_rogers_hyp_64kb.mp3", "duration": 67}, {"section": 9, "title": "A Wish - Read by IK", "readers": [7785], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/a_wish_1809.poem_librivox/wish_rogers_ik_64kb.mp3", "duration": 72}, {"section": 10, "title": "A Wish - Read by JFG", "readers": [12732], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/a_wish_1809.poem_librivox/wish_rogers_jfg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 56}, {"section": 11, "title": "A Wish - Read by LAH", "readers": [1212], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/a_wish_1809.poem_librivox/wish_rogers_lah_64kb.mp3", "duration": 70}, {"section": 12, "title": "A Wish - Read by LCW", "readers": [8425], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/a_wish_1809.poem_librivox/wish_rogers_lcw_64kb.mp3", "duration": 61}, {"section": 13, "title": "A Wish - Read by LL", "readers": [12731], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/a_wish_1809.poem_librivox/wish_rogers_ll_64kb.mp3", "duration": 60}, {"section": 14, "title": "A Wish - Read by MPE", "readers": [12556], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/a_wish_1809.poem_librivox/wish_rogers_mpe_64kb.mp3", "duration": 64}, {"section": 15, "title": "A Wish - Read by ND", "readers": [12565], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/a_wish_1809.poem_librivox/wish_rogers_nd_64kb.mp3", "duration": 62}, {"section": 16, "title": "A Wish - Read by NR", "readers": [11535], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/a_wish_1809.poem_librivox/wish_rogers_nr_64kb.mp3", "duration": 63}, {"section": 17, "title": "A Wish - Read by PS", "readers": [8576], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/a_wish_1809.poem_librivox/wish_rogers_ps_64kb.mp3", "duration": 61}, {"section": 18, "title": "A Wish - Read by RAJ", "readers": [12236], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/a_wish_1809.poem_librivox/wish_rogers_raj_64kb.mp3", "duration": 74}, {"section": 19, "title": "A Wish - Read by TEN", "readers": [12718], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/a_wish_1809.poem_librivox/wish_rogers_ten_64kb.mp3", "duration": 58}, {"section": 20, "title": "A Wish - Read by TP", "readers": [10789], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/a_wish_1809.poem_librivox/wish_rogers_tp_64kb.mp3", "duration": 74}, {"section": 21, "title": "A Wish - Read by VB", "readers": [8169], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/a_wish_1809.poem_librivox/wish_rogers_vb_64kb.mp3", "duration": 74}]}
