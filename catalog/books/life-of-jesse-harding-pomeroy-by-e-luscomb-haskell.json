{"title": "Life of Jesse Harding Pomeroy", "description": "\"The Life of Jesse Harding Pomeroy: The Most Remarkable Case in the History of Crime or Criminal Law\" by E. Luscomb Haskell was published in Boston, Massachusetts in 1892 by the Harvard Law School Library, and is part of \"The Making of the Modern Law, Legal Treatises, 1800-1926\" series.  Remarkable insight into the life of Pomeroy prior to, during, and following the crimes for which he was sentenced to life imprisonment at the tender age of 14, this is an excellent complement to Pomeroy's \"autobiography\" which was published immediately following his trial in 1874.  The advantages offered by this short book are that it was researched and published less than twenty years after the trial and conviction; that the accused was still alive at the time of publication; and that a large amount relates to the legal perspective of one of the most fascinating and confounding episodes of American criminology.  Jesse Harding Pomeroy was sentenced to life in prison in 1874 at the age of 14 for the commission of two murders, and has therefore been referred to as \"America's youngest serial killer\" to this day.  Other books have been written about Pomeroy over the years, as it makes for a most interesting character study, in addition to its legal implications, journalistic influence, and the effect of public outcry for justice and safety were preeminent.  - Summary by Roger Melin", "duration": 7975, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "12254", "name": "E.
