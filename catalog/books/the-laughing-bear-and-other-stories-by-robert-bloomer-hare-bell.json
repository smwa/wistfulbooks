The stories start in Korea with The Laughing Bear (or MOUWOU The Deliverer.as he is also called in Korea) and move through the world of a not nice girl and the visits she receives from the Gray Witch, to the hilarious adventures in the barn yard and we even dip under the world for a few to see what is happening in middle earth. All are interesting and may well surprise you in their uniqueness.   - Summary by phil chenevert", "duration": 8066, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "14496", "name": "Robert Bloomer Hare Bell"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/librivoxcdcoverart36/laughingbear_2002.jpg", "copyright_year": "1917", "genres": ["Myths", "Legends & Fairy Tales"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Campbell Schelp"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "The Laughing Bear", "readers": [13833], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/thelaughingbear_2002_librivox/laughingbear_01_bell_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1282}, {"section": 2, "title": "The Gray Witch", "readers": [13637], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/thelaughingbear_2002_librivox/laughingbear_02_bell_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1332}, {"section": 3, "title": "Mr. Rooster", "readers": [10261], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/thelaughingbear_2002_librivox/laughingbear_03_bell_64kb.mp3", "duration": 408}, {"section": 4, "title": "The Mid-Earth People", "readers": [10261], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/thelaughingbear_2002_librivox/laughingbear_04_bell_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1373}, {"section": 5, "title": "The Black Hus", "readers": [13281], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/thelaughingbear_2002_librivox/laughingbear_05_bell_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1421}, {"section": 6, "title": "The Leviathan", "readers": [13633], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/thelaughingbear_2002_librivox/laughingbear_06_bell_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1090}, {"section": 7, "title": "The Brown Friar", "readers": [13278], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/thelaughingbear_2002_librivox/laughingbear_07_bell_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1160}]}
