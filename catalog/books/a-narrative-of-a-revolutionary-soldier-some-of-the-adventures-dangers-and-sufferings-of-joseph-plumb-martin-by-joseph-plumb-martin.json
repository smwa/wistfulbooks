{"title": "Narrative of a Revolutionary Soldier: Some of the Adventures, Dangers, and Sufferings of Joseph Plumb Martin", "description": "Joining the Continental Army as a teenager, Joseph Plumb Martin spent the next eight years fighting in the Revolutionary War as an enlisted man.  His memoirs tell in detail his experiences during that time...the bitter cold, hunger, loss of life, long marches, and fear of battle.  He also includes tales of fishing, hunting, and other activities...including encounters with a \"saucy miss\".  His narrative reveals much about American life at the time and is one of the fullest and best accounts of the Revolutionary War, presented from a private's point of view.<br /><br />\n\nThe book has been later republished under the names Private Yankee Doodle and Memoir of a Revolutionary Soldier. (Summary by Barry Eads)<br /><br />\nThis recording was read from a hard copy of the book, no online version being available at the time of the recording.", "duration": 28912, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "2112", "name": "Joseph Plumb Martin"}], "coverArt": "http://www.archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt10/Narrative_Revolutionary_Soldier_1108.jpg", "copyright_year": "1830", "genres": ["War & Military", "Memoirs", "Early Modern"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Barry Eads"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Barry Eads"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Barry Eads"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Elli"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "01 - Preface and Chapter 1, Introductory", "readers": [3664], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/narrative_revolutionary_soldier_1106_librivox/revolutionarysoldier_01_martin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1394}, {"section": 2, "title": "02 - Chapter 2, Part 1, Campaign of 1776", "readers": [3664], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/narrative_revolutionary_soldier_1106_librivox/revolutionarysoldier_02_martin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2563}, {"section": 3, "title": "03 - Chapter 2, Part 2, Campaign of 1776", "readers": [3664], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/narrative_revolutionary_soldier_1106_librivox/revolutionarysoldier_03_martin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1685}, {"section": 4, "title": "04 - Chapter 3, Part 1, Campaign of 1777", "readers": [3664], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/narrative_revolutionary_soldier_1106_librivox/revolutionarysoldier_04_martin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2076}, {"section": 5, "title": "05 - Chapter 3, Part 2, Campaign of 1777", "readers": [3664], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/narrative_revolutionary_soldier_1106_librivox/revolutionarysoldier_05_martin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2597}, {"section": 6, "title": "06 - Chapter 4, Part 1, Campaign of 1778", "readers": [3664], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/narrative_revolutionary_soldier_1106_librivox/revolutionarysoldier_06_martin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2141}, {"section": 7, "title": "07 - Chapter 4, Part 2, Campaign of 1778", "readers": [3664], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/narrative_revolutionary_soldier_1106_librivox/revolutionarysoldier_07_martin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2063}, {"section": 8, "title": "08 - Chapter 5, Campaign of 1779", "readers": [3664], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/narrative_revolutionary_soldier_1106_librivox/revolutionarysoldier_08_martin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1997}, {"section": 9, "title": "09 - Chapter 6, Part 1, Campaign of 1780", "readers": [3664], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/narrative_revolutionary_soldier_1106_librivox/revolutionarysoldier_09_martin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2119}, {"section": 10, "title": "10 - Chapter 6, Part 2, Campaign of 1780", "readers": [3664], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/narrative_revolutionary_soldier_1106_librivox/revolutionarysoldier_10_martin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1830}, {"section": 11, "title": "11 - Chapter 7, Part 1, Campaign of 1781", "readers": [3664], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/narrative_revolutionary_soldier_1106_librivox/revolutionarysoldier_11_martin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1916}, {"section": 12, "title": "12 - Chapter 7, Part 2, Campaign of 1781", "readers": [3664], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/narrative_revolutionary_soldier_1106_librivox/revolutionarysoldier_12_martin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1966}, {"section": 13, "title": "13 - Chapter 8, Part 1, Campaign of 1782", "readers": [3664], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/narrative_revolutionary_soldier_1106_librivox/revolutionarysoldier_13_martin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1136}, {"section": 14, "title": "14 - Chapter 8, Part 2, Campaign of 1782", "readers": [3664], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/narrative_revolutionary_soldier_1106_librivox/revolutionarysoldier_14_martin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1329}, {"section": 15, "title": "15 - Chapter 9, Campaign of 1783", "readers": [3664], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/narrative_revolutionary_soldier_1106_librivox/revolutionarysoldier_15_martin_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2100}]}
