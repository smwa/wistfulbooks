Her hapless father hopes to find her a good marriage, but \u00c9milie, spoiled and willful, has repeatedly turned away suitors. She has a list of requirements for any prospective husband, one of which is that he must, of course, be \u201cthe son of a peer of France.\u201d (The peerage was an elite aristocratic distinction.)
