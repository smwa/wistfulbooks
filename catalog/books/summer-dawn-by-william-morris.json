{"title": "Summer Dawn", "description": "LibriVox volunteers bring you 16 recordings of \"Summer Dawn\" by William Morris.<br>\r\nThis was the Weekly Poetry project for July 10, 2022. <br> ------<br>\r\nWhen this poem was first published in 1856 it had no title. Subsequently, the 1858 edition gave the sonnet its title of \"Summer Dawn.\" And it is a sonnet, though it does not follow traditional English or Italian models. Perhaps Morris was giving hint of the Proven\u00e7al 'alba.' These poems in their early form were conversations between two lovers. The requirement is that each stanza end with the word 'alba' [dawn]. Morris ends lines five and eleven this way. - Summary by KevinS", "duration": 1294, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "961", "name": "William Morris"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/summerdawn_2207.poem_librivox/summer_dawn_2207.jpg", "copyright_year": "1919", "genres": ["Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "KevinS"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "TriciaG"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "KevinS"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Summer Dawn - Read by AH", "readers": [15965], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/summerdawn_2207.poem_librivox/summerdawn_morris_ah_64kb.mp3", "duration": 80}, {"section": 2, "title": "Summer Dawn - Read by BK", "readers": [8786], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/summerdawn_2207.poem_librivox/summerdawn_morris_bk_64kb.mp3", "duration": 85}, {"section": 3, "title": "Summer Dawn - Read by CZ", "readers": [15806], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/summerdawn_2207.poem_librivox/summerdawn_morris_cz_64kb.mp3", "duration": 72}, {"section": 4, "title": "Summer Dawn - Read by ELO", "readers": [9872], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/summerdawn_2207.poem_librivox/summerdawn_morris_el0_64kb.mp3", "duration": 84}, {"section": 5, "title": "Summer Dawn - Read by KLA", "readers": [16550], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/summerdawn_2207.poem_librivox/summerdawn_morris_kla_64kb.mp3", "duration": 94}, {"section": 6, "title": "Summer Dawn - Read by KS", "readers": [13278], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/summerdawn_2207.poem_librivox/summerdawn_morris_ks_64kb.mp3", "duration": 70}, {"section": 7, "title": "Summer Dawn - Read by LAH", "readers": [1212], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/summerdawn_2207.poem_librivox/summerdawn_morris_lah_64kb.mp3", "duration": 75}, {"section": 8, "title": "Summer Dawn - Read by LB", "readers": [17483], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/summerdawn_2207.poem_librivox/summerdawn_morris_lb_64kb.mp3", "duration": 76}, {"section": 9, "title": "Summer Dawn - Read by LC", "readers": [16793], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/summerdawn_2207.poem_librivox/summerdawn_morris_lc_64kb.mp3", "duration": 106}, {"section": 10, "title": "Summer Dawn - Read by LCW", "readers": [8425], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/summerdawn_2207.poem_librivox/summerdawn_morris_lcw_64kb.mp3", "duration": 67}, {"section": 11, "title": "Summer Dawn - Read by LS", "readers": [15365], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/summerdawn_2207.poem_librivox/summerdawn_morris_ls_64kb.mp3", "duration": 74}, {"section": 12, "title": "Summer Dawn - Read by MLM", "readers": [14499], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/summerdawn_2207.poem_librivox/summerdawn_morris_mlm_64kb.mp3", "duration": 103}, {"section": 13, "title": "Summer Dawn - Read by PB", "readers": [17599], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/summerdawn_2207.poem_librivox/summerdawn_morris_pb_64kb.mp3", "duration": 74}, {"section": 14, "title": "Summer Dawn - Read by PLM", "readers": [13243], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/summerdawn_2207.poem_librivox/summerdawn_morris_plm_64kb.mp3", "duration": 69}, {"section": 15, "title": "Summer Dawn - Read by RAJ", "readers": [12236], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/summerdawn_2207.poem_librivox/summerdawn_morris_raj_64kb.mp3", "duration": 73}, {"section": 16, "title": "Summer Dawn - Read by SL", "readers": [7217], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/summerdawn_2207.poem_librivox/summerdawn_morris_sl_64kb.mp3", "duration": 92}]}
