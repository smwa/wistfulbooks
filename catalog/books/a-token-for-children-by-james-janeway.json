{"title": "Token for Children", "description": "Some of you have had the privilege to carry in your bosoms some of those . . . unfledged angels sent here but for a little while and then caught away to heaven, that their mothers' hearts might follow them, and their fathers' aspirations might pursue them. I confess to a great liking for such books as Janeway's \"Token for Children,\" where the deaths of many pious boys and girls are recorded with the holy sayings which they used. The Lord sets a high value on his little ones, and therefore frequently gathers them while they are like flowers in the bud. (Summary from Charles H.
