{"title": "Snow Storm", "description": "LibriVox volunteers bring you 15 recordings of A Snow Storm by T.F. Young.<br>\nThis was the Weekly Poetry project for January 6, 2019.   <br> ------<br>\nPedantic critics may find fault with my modest productions, and perhaps justly, in regard to grammatical construction, and mechanical arrangement, but I shall be satisfied, if the public discern a vein of true poetry glittering here and there through what I have just written. The public are the final judges of compositions of this sort, and not the writer himself, or his personal friends. It is they, therefore, who must decide whether these humble attempts of my 'prentice hand, shall be numbered with writings that have been forgotten, or whether their author shall be encouraged to strike his lyre in a higher key, to accompany his Muse, while she tries to sing in a loftier strain.<br>\n\nTHE AUTHOR.<br>\nPORT ALBERT, March, 1887.", "duration": 2041, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "13914", "name": "Thomas Frederick Young"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/snow_storm_1901.poem_librivox/snowstorm_1901.jpg", "copyright_year": "1887", "genres": ["Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "David Lawrence"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "A Snow Storm - Read by  BK", "readers": [8786], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/snow_storm_1901.poem_librivox/snowstorm_young_bk_64kb.mp3", "duration": 154}, {"section": 2, "title": "A Snow Storm - Read by  DL", "readers": [2911], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/snow_storm_1901.poem_librivox/snowstorm_young_dl_64kb.mp3", "duration": 137}, {"section": 3, "title": "A Snow Storm - Read by  FH", "readers": [12500], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/snow_storm_1901.poem_librivox/snowstorm_young_fh_64kb.mp3", "duration": 141}, {"section": 4, "title": "A Snow Storm - Read by  GB", "readers": [4969], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/snow_storm_1901.poem_librivox/snowstorm_young_gb_64kb.mp3", "duration": 152}, {"section": 5, "title": "A Snow Storm - Read by  GG", "readers": [8011], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/snow_storm_1901.poem_librivox/snowstorm_young_gg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 147}, {"section": 6, "title": "A Snow Storm - Read by  IK", "readers": [7785], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/snow_storm_1901.poem_librivox/snowstorm_young_ik_64kb.mp3", "duration": 138}, {"section": 7, "title": "A Snow Storm - Read by  JFG", "readers": [12732], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/snow_storm_1901.poem_librivox/snowstorm_young_jfg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 121}, {"section": 8, "title": "A Snow Storm - Read by  JK", "readers": [13022], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/snow_storm_1901.poem_librivox/snowstorm_young_jk_64kb.mp3", "duration": 119}, {"section": 9, "title": "A Snow Storm - Read by  LCW", "readers": [8425], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/snow_storm_1901.poem_librivox/snowstorm_young_lcw_64kb.mp3", "duration": 121}, {"section": 10, "title": "A Snow Storm - Read by NR", "readers": [11535], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/snow_storm_1901.poem_librivox/snowstorm_young_nr_64kb.mp3", "duration": 140}, {"section": 11, "title": "A Snow Storm - Read by  PS", "readers": [8576], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/snow_storm_1901.poem_librivox/snowstorm_young_ps_64kb.mp3", "duration": 122}, {"section": 12, "title": "A Snow Storm - Read by  SH", "readers": [12918], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/snow_storm_1901.poem_librivox/snowstorm_young_sh_64kb.mp3", "duration": 126}, {"section": 13, "title": "A Snow Storm - Read by  SRB", "readers": [12265], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/snow_storm_1901.poem_librivox/snowstorm_young_srb_64kb.mp3", "duration": 131}, {"section": 14, "title": "A Snow Storm - Read by  TP", "readers": [10789], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/snow_storm_1901.poem_librivox/snowstorm_young_tp_64kb.mp3", "duration": 132}, {"section": 15, "title": "A Snow Storm - Read by  VB", "readers": [8169], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/snow_storm_1901.poem_librivox/snowstorm_young_vb_64kb.mp3", "duration": 160}]}
