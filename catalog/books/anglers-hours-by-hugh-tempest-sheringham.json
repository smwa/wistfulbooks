The author\u2019s love was fly fishing\u2014\u201c\u2026while there are trout, life is worth living\u2026\u201d but he was no snob. An Angler\u2019s Hours includes several chapters about coarse fishing (grayling, dace, chub, etc.) as well as a surprising account of the Japanese tenkara method as used in England.<br>\r\n\r\nSheringham's style is similar to that of the much-loved B.B.

He doesn\u2019t bore us with technical details but writes of the simple joys of angling\u2014\"a man who gazes at the wares in a tackle-shop on a sunny day in April has certainly a fishing expedition in prospect\u201d\u2014not forgetting the pleasure of a nice pot of tea at the end of the day.<br>\r\n\r\nHugh Tempest Sheringham (1876 - 1930) was angling editor of The Field (London) and considered one of the premier British authors on freshwater angling both for his knowledge of the subject and readable style.  - Summary by Adrian Praetzellis", "duration": 22747, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "16566", "name": "Hugh Tempest Sheringham"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/anglers_hours_2206_librivox/anglerhours_2206.jpg", "copyright_year": "1905", "genres": ["Crafts & Hobbies", "Sports & Recreation"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Adrian Praetzellis"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Adrian Praetzellis"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Sonia"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Sonia"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Introductory", "readers": [1331], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/anglers_hours_2206_librivox/anglershours_00_sheringham_64kb.mp3", "duration": 382}, {"section": 1, "title": "Chapter 1.
