{"title": "Scandal in Bohemia", "description": "This story, found in The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, is one of the best in my opinion.  Is it possible for the machine like brain of this genius to be foiled?  Has Holmes finally met his match?  And surely it is not by a lowly woman who outwits him!   In this story Holmes meets a woman whom forever after he refers to as \"THE\" woman so anything is possible.   Listen and enjoy as he matches wits with 'THE' woman and comes out on the losing end.  Let Dr. Watson, his faithful companion, explain how he deals with this err ....problem.
