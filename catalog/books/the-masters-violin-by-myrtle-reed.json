{"title": "Master's Violin", "description": "Originally published in 1904, \u201cThe Master\u2019s Violin\u201d is the seventh novel by Myrtle Reed. It is set in a German town of Pennsylvania, East Lancaster, giving two characters fairly difficult accents to perform. The story entails a widow, Margaret Irving, and her son, Lynn. Returning to East Lancaster after 20 years they are hoping to further Lynn\u2019s musical career under the tutelage of Herr Kaufmann, the master violinist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe find the young lady, Iris, brought up by her adopted Aunt Peace, interacting with her new neighbours, as she slowly learns to live on her own. As we get to know Doctor Brinkerhoff we discover who he has grown fond of over the years. The love stories of three couples continue throughout the novel and bring us to the potential they all carried throughout their lives.", "duration": 20767, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "2406", "name": "Myrtle Reed"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/masters_violin_2201_librivox/masters_violin_2201.jpg", "copyright_year": "1904", "genres": ["Literary Fiction"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Daryl Wor"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Daryl Wor"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "DaveC"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "DaveC"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "The Master Plays", "readers": [6415], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/masters_violin_2201_librivox/themastersviolin_01_reed_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1170}, {"section": 2, "title": "''Mine Cremona''", "readers": [6415], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/masters_violin_2201_librivox/themastersviolin_02_reed_64kb.mp3", "duration": 833}, {"section": 3, "title": "The Gift of Peace", "readers": [6415], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/masters_violin_2201_librivox/themastersviolin_03_reed_64kb.mp3", "duration": 946}, {"section": 4, "title": "Social Position", "readers": [6415], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/masters_violin_2201_librivox/themastersviolin_04_reed_64kb.mp3", "duration": 980}, {"section": 5, "title": "The Light of Dreams", "readers": [6415], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/masters_violin_2201_librivox/themastersviolin_05_reed_64kb.mp3", "duration": 976}, {"section": 6, "title": "A Letter", "readers": [6415], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/masters_violin_2201_librivox/themastersviolin_06_reed_64kb.mp3", "duration": 710}, {"section": 7, "title": "Friends", "readers": [6415], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/masters_violin_2201_librivox/themastersviolin_07_reed_64kb.mp3", "duration": 963}, {"section": 8, "title": "A Bit of Human Driftwood", "readers": [6415], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/masters_violin_2201_librivox/themastersviolin_08_reed_64kb.mp3", "duration": 899}, {"section": 9, "title": "Rosemary And Mignonette", "readers": [6415], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/masters_violin_2201_librivox/themastersviolin_09_reed_64kb.mp3", "duration": 432}, {"section": 10, "title": "In The Garden", "readers": [6415], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/masters_violin_2201_librivox/themastersviolin_10_reed_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1125}, {"section": 11, "title": "\"Sunset And Evening Star\"", "readers": [6415], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/masters_violin_2201_librivox/themastersviolin_11_reed_64kb.mp3", "duration": 997}, {"section": 12, "title": "The False Line", "readers": [6415], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/masters_violin_2201_librivox/themastersviolin_12_reed_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1149}, {"section": 13, "title": "To Iris", "readers": [6415], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/masters_violin_2201_librivox/themastersviolin_13_reed_64kb.mp3", "duration": 316}, {"section": 14, "title": "Her Name-Flower", "readers": [6415], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/masters_violin_2201_librivox/themastersviolin_14_reed_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1018}, {"section": 15, "title": "Little Lady", "readers": [6415], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/masters_violin_2201_librivox/themastersviolin_15_reed_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1053}, {"section": 16, "title": "Afraid of Life", "readers": [6415], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/masters_violin_2201_librivox/themastersviolin_16_reed_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1408}, {"section": 17, "title": "\"He Loves Her Still\"", "readers": [6415], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/masters_violin_2201_librivox/themastersviolin_17_reed_64kb.mp3", "duration": 899}, {"section": 18, "title": "Lynn Comes Into His Own", "readers": [6415], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/masters_violin_2201_librivox/themastersviolin_18_reed_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1218}, {"section": 19, "title": "The Secret Chamber", "readers": [6415], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/masters_violin_2201_librivox/themastersviolin_19_reed_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1123}, {"section": 20, "title": "\"Mine Brudder's Friend\"", "readers": [6415], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/masters_violin_2201_librivox/themastersviolin_20_reed_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1229}, {"section": 21, "title": "The Cremona Speaks", "readers": [6415], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/masters_violin_2201_librivox/themastersviolin_21_reed_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1323}]}
