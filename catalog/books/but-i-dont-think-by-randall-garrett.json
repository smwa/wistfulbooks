{"title": "But, I Don't Think", "description": "The title is obscure and a bit unsettling I admit; what could it possible mean?   Randall Garrett wrote a story here that had me blissfully going in the wrong direction until he quietly yanked the rug from under my feet and made me fume a bit with irritation and amazement.  I loved it and hated it because it did not end the way I wanted it to but the way it obviously should.  The society and culture in the galaxy he has presupposed is as fascinating as the story itself and I can only hope he expanded on it in other books somewhere. The publisher quotes another story by R. Phillip Dachboden to indicate what he meant\n \"As every thinking man knows, every slave always yearns for the freedom his master denies him...<br />\nBut, gentlemen,\" said the Physician, \"I really don't think we can consider any religion which has human sacrifice as an integral part as a humane religion.\"    \"At least,\" added the Painter with a chuckle, \"not as far as the victim is concerned.\" The Philosopher looked irritated. \"Bosh!
