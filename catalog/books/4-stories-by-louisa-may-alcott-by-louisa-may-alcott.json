{"title": "4 Stories by Louisa May Alcott", "description": "Here are four delightful short stories written by the famous author specifically for girls. As she says in the tiny preface \"These stories were written for my own amusement during a period of enforced seclusion. The flowers which were my solace and pleasure suggested titles for the tales and gave an interest to the work.   If my girls find a little beauty or sunshine in these common blossoms, their old friend will not have made her Garland in vain.\nL.M. ALCOTT.\"   The stories are An Ivy Spray & Ladies Slippers; Pansies; Water-Lilies and Mountain-Laurel & Maiden-Hair.  They are all between 40 minutes and 55 minutes finished audio so they are not short but all four are typical stories from the talented pen of Miss Alcott.   - Summary by Phil Chenevert and the author", "duration": 12502, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "93", "name": "Louisa May Alcott"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/4storiesbylouisamayalcott_1608_librivox/4_stories_1608.jpg", "copyright_year": "1887", "genres": ["Single Author Collections"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "fiddlesticks"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "AN IVY SPRAY AND LADIES' SLIPPERS", "readers": [9881], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/4storiesbylouisamayalcott_1608_librivox/4storiesbylouisamayalcott_01_alcott_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2563}, {"section": 2, "title": "PANSIES", "readers": [10665], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/4storiesbylouisamayalcott_1608_librivox/4storiesbylouisamayalcott_02_alcott_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2706}, {"section": 3, "title": "WATER-LILIES", "readers": [10261], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/4storiesbylouisamayalcott_1608_librivox/4storiesbylouisamayalcott_03_alcott_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3045}, {"section": 4, "title": "MOUNTAIN-LAUREL AND MAIDEN-HAIR - Part 1", "readers": [9737], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/4storiesbylouisamayalcott_1608_librivox/4storiesbylouisamayalcott_04_alcott_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1770}, {"section": 5, "title": "MOUNTAIN-LAUREL AND MAIDEN-HAIR - Part 2", "readers": [9737], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/4storiesbylouisamayalcott_1608_librivox/4storiesbylouisamayalcott_05_alcott_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2418}]}
