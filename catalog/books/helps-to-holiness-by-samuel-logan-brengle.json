{"title": "Helps to Holiness", "description": "Samuel Logan Brengle was a commissioner in the Salvation Army. His books are known for the practicality, joyfulness and authenticity. His life was spent working with people on the streets, so his insights into the work of the Holy Spirit are relevant to everyday life. His holiness was that of the street, the kitchen, and everyday life. His stories are of men and women living their daily lives. This book is the first in his \"Holiness\" trilogy, explaining what Holiness is and how to get it. - Summary by Beth Thomas", "duration": 18642, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "12965", "name": "Samuel Logan Brengle"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/helpstoholiness_1904_librivox/helps_holiness_1905.jpg", "copyright_year": "1896", "genres": ["Christianity -
