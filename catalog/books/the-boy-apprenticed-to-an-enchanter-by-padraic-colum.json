{"title": "Boy Apprenticed to an Enchanter", "description": "King Manus ruled over the Western Island, and he had a castle that was neither higher nor wider than any other King\u2019s castle. But he had a stable that was more strongly built than any other King\u2019s stable. It had double walls of stone; it had oak beams; it had an iron door with four locks to it. And before this door two soldiers with drawn swords in their hands stayed night and day.\r\n<BR><BR>\r\nIn those days, if one went before a King and asked him for a gift the King might not refuse to give what was asked of him. But King Manus was hard to come to by those with requests. For before the chamber where he sat or slept there stood a servant to take the request, and if it were one that might not be brought to him, to make an excuse for the King. - Summary from the Prologue", "duration": 10722, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "1664", "name": "P\u00e1draic Colum"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/apprenticedtoanenchanter_2312_librivox/boy_apprenticed_to_an_enchanter_p_colum_2312.jpg", "copyright_year": "1920", "genres": ["Myths", "Legends & Fairy Tales"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Elijah Fisher"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "ToddHW"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Betsy Walker"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "PROLOGUE THE HORSES OF KING MANUS", "readers": [6754], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/apprenticedtoanenchanter_2312_librivox/boyapprenticedtoanenchanter_00_colum_64kb.mp3", "duration": 440}, {"section": 1, "title": "Part 1 of THE STORY OF EEAN THE FISHERMAN\u2019S SON I.
