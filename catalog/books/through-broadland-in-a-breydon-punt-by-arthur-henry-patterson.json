{"title": "Through Broadland in a Breydon Punt", "description": "Arthur Henry Patterson was a self-taught naturalist who, from a very early age, devoted much of his free time to observing, discovering and documenting all aspects of the natural history of the Norfolk Broads, especially the area around Breydon Water near his home town of Great Yarmouth. At some 75000 acres (117 sq miles / 303 sq km), the Broads are the largest protected wetland in Britain.\n<br><br>\nAHP was the author of many books about Broadland as well as submitting numerous papers and articles to nature societies and journals. Also, he was for many years, a regular and popular contributor (under the pen name of John Knowlittle) to the local county newspaper.\n<br><br>\nThe chapters of this book, Through Broadland in a Breydon Punt, originally appeared during the autumn of 1919 in the columns of the Eastern Daily Press and such was the level of interest in the subject matter, that AHP was persuaded to republish them in book form.\n<br><br>\nSo, if you have an interest in nature, sailing or just messing about on the water, then why not hop aboard and join Mr Patterson and me as we launch The Yarwelp - his (17 foot long by 4 foot wide by 1 foot deep) converted Breydon Punt for a unique holiday experience, travelling around the Norfolk Broads? - Summary by TND", "duration": 16986, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "13987", "name": "Arthur Henry Patterson"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/throughbroadland_2008_librivox/through_broadland_2008.jpg", "copyright_year": "1920", "genres": ["Travel & Geography", "Modern (20th C)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "TND"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "TND"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "J.
