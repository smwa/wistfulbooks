{"title": "Railway Bridge of the Silvery Tay", "description": "LibriVox volunteers bring you nine different readings of <em>The Railway Bridge of the Silvery Tay</em>, by William McGonagall, to celebrate April Fool's Day.  Scottish poet William McGonagall is widely considered to be one of the worst poets of the English language.  He wrote this poem in honor of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tay_Rail_Bridge\">The Tay Rail Bridge</a> which was opened in 1878 and which subsequently collapsed a year later, causing the death of 75 train passengers, and inspiring McGonagall to write yet famously bad poem entitled <em>The Tay Bridge Disaster</em>.
