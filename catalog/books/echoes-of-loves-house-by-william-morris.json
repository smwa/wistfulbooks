{"title": "Echoes of Love\u2019s House", "description": "LibriVox volunteers bring you 11 recordings of Echoes of Love\u2019s House by William Morris. This was the Weekly Poetry project for January 9th, 2011.<br><br>William Morris was an English textile designer, artist, writer, and socialist associated with the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood and the English Arts and Crafts Movement. Morris wrote and published poetry, fiction, and translations of ancient and medieval texts throughout his life.<br><br>Today, Morris's poetry is little-read. His fantasy romances languished out of print for decades until their rediscovery amid the great fantasy revival of the late 1960s following the phenomenal success of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. But his textile and wallpaper designs remain a staple of the Arts and Crafts Revival of the turn of the 21st century, and the reproduction of Morris designs as fabric, wrapping paper, and craft kits of all sorts is testament to the enduring appeal of his work. The William Morris Societies in Britain, the US, and Canada are active in preserving Morris's work and ideas.", "duration": 981, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "961", "name": "William Morris"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt22/Echoes_Loves_House_1209.jpg", "copyright_year": "1892", "genres": ["Poetry", "Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Stav Nisser"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "None"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Echoes of Love's House- Read by ALG", "readers": [4744], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/echoesloves_house_1101_librivox/echoesofloveshouse_morris_alg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 76}, {"section": 2, "title": "Echoes of Love's House - Read by CC", "readers": [4586], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/echoesloves_house_1101_librivox/echoesofloveshouse_morris_cc_64kb.mp3", "duration": 87}, {"section": 3, "title": "Echoes of Love's House - Read by DL", "readers": [2911], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/echoesloves_house_1101_librivox/echoesofloveshouse_morris_dl_64kb.mp3", "duration": 87}, {"section": 4, "title": "Echoes of Love's House - Read by DRB", "readers": [94], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/echoesloves_house_1101_librivox/echoesofloveshouse_morris_drb_64kb.mp3", "duration": 96}, {"section": 5, "title": "Echoes of Love's House - Read by EL", "readers": [5994], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/echoesloves_house_1101_librivox/echoesofloveshouse_morris_el_64kb.mp3", "duration": 80}, {"section": 6, "title": "Echoes of Love's House - Read by GHS", "readers": [4705], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/echoesloves_house_1101_librivox/echoesofloveshouse_morris_ghs_64kb.mp3", "duration": 94}, {"section": 7, "title": "Echoes of Love's House - Read by JB", "readers": [77], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/echoesloves_house_1101_librivox/echoesofloveshouse_morris_jb_64kb.mp3", "duration": 93}, {"section": 8, "title": "Echoes of Love's House - Read by KW", "readers": [5876], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/echoesloves_house_1101_librivox/echoesofloveshouse_morris_kw_64kb.mp3", "duration": 75}, {"section": 9, "title": "Echoes of Love's House - Read by LAH", "readers": [1212], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/echoesloves_house_1101_librivox/echoesofloveshouse_morris_lah_64kb.mp3", "duration": 99}, {"section": 10, "title": "Echoes of Love's House - Read by LLW", "readers": [4738], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/echoesloves_house_1101_librivox/echoesofloveshouse_morris_llw_64kb.mp3", "duration": 100}, {"section": 11, "title": "Echoes of Love's House - Read by MDK", "readers": [5991], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/echoesloves_house_1101_librivox/echoesofloveshouse_morris_mdk_64kb.mp3", "duration": 94}]}
