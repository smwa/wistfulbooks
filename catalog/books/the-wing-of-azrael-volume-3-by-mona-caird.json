{"title": "Wing of Azrael, Volume 3", "description": "Mona Caird, a British writer and feminist, criticized in numerous non-fiction writings the state of marriage as it existed in her time. Her novel The Wing of Azrael reflects her criticisms. This is the final volume of three.\r\n\r\nIn vol. 3, Viola finally makes the acquaintance of Sibella Lincoln, who tries to make her see that her miserable marriage doesn't have to be a life sentence. Meanwhile, Philip grows increasingly jealous and ever more watchful of Viola, threatening to put her under lock and key if she continues to meet with Harry Lancaster. Viola is yet again faced with another harrowing decision: will she continue her tortured and degrading life with Philip, or will she flout society\u2019s rules and risk becoming a pariah in her pursuit of happiness?
