{"title": "At A Lunar Eclipse", "description": "LibriVox volunteers bring you 25 recordings of At A Lunar Eclipse by Thomas Hardy.<br>\nThis was the Weekly Poetry project for January 27, 2019.    <br> ------<br>\nWhile Hardy wrote poetry throughout his life and regarded himself primarily as a poet, his first collection was not published until 1898. Initially, therefore, he gained fame as the author of such novels as Far from the Madding Crowd (1874), The Mayor of Casterbridge (1886), Tess of the d'Urbervilles (1891), and Jude the Obscure (1895). During his lifetime, Hardy's poetry was acclaimed by younger poets (particularly the Georgians) who viewed him as a mentor.  - Summary by Wikipedia", "duration": 1825, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "92", "name": "Thomas Hardy"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/lunar_eclipse_1902.poem_librivox/lunar_eclipse_1902.jpg", "copyright_year": "1919", "genres": ["Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "David Lawrence"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "At A Lunar Eclipse -
