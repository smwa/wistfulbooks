{"title": "Early Church Collection Volume 3", "description": "This collection begins with Augustine's exposition of the Apostles' Creed, a confession of faith (particularly addressing the Trinity) attributed to Gregory Thaumaturgus and a series of statements on christology. Then come two works attributed to Hippolytus and a treatise addressed to Tatian arguing, without using Scripture, for the existence of the soul. Dionysius of Alexandria comments on the authorship of the book of Revelation and Alexander, archbishop of Alexandria excommunicates Arius (this was probably ghostwritten by Athanasius). What remains of \"a discourse on the Divine Nature and the Incarnation, against the heretics Beron and Helix\" is followed by several exegetical works by Dionysius of Alexandria and the beginning of a treatise of the resurrection usually attributed to Justin Martyr. \"Discourse on all the Saints\" concerns martyrs and the fragments of Lactantius were written by the adviser of Constantine, the first Christian Romans emperor. A survey of Christian novels follows (some of the works referenced can be found <a href=\"https://librivox.org/ante-nicene-christian-library-translations-of-the-writings-of-the-fathers-down-to-ad-325-by-alexander-roberts/\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://librivox.org/ante-nicene-christian-library-translations-of-the-writings-of-the-fathers-down-to-ad-325-volume-2-by-alexander-roberts/\">here</a>). The Phoenix may or may not have been written by Lactantius and formed the basis for a well-known Old English poem. Amongst several short works, there are Cyprian's extracts from the Old testament prophets exhorting to repentance and his treatise on chastity. Augustine preaches a sermon on the virtue of patience, Gregory of Nyssa laments the death of Meletius (a bishop) and then advises Christians not to go on pilgrimages to Jerusalem. This collection ends with the martyr story of Symphorosa and her family.\r\n - Summary by InTheDesert", "duration": 27526, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "18", "name": " Various"}],
