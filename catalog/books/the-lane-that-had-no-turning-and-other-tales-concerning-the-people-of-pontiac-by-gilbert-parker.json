{"title": "Lane that had no Turning, and Other Tales concerning the People of Pontiac", "description": "This is a collection of short stories by Gilbert Parker. Parker was a Canadian writer who wrote a number of bestsellers that had a lasting influence on Canadian literature, but whose importance for his time is now largely overlooked. One of the prime examples of his art is the short story collection <i>The Lane that had no Turning</i>, which is a series of short stories set in the fictional provincial town of Pontiac in Quebec. This collection \"contains some of his best work, and is viewed by some as being in the tradition of such Gothic classics as Stoker's Dracula and James's The Turn of the Screw.\" (Wikipedia). This edition also contains six <i>Parables of a Province</i>, which are very different in style from the rest of the book, but add an interesting additional facet to the collection.  - Summary by
