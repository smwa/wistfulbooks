{"title": "Consoling Thoughts of Saint Francis de Sales", "description": "Francis de Sales (1567-1622) was a French priest and later bishop of Geneva who was revered as a master of spiritual direction and fondly remembered for his keen insights into the personal spiritual struggles of men and women of all faiths. His Introduction to the Devout Life, which he wrote especially for laypersons, and his Treatise on the Love of God remain fundamental reading for all earthly pilgrims who seek personal moral improvement and strive for spiritual perfection.<br><br>Pere Huguet has gathered together in this one volume some of the more poignant insights and suggestions contained in the writings of Saint Francis de Sales and organized them under more than eighty chapters. They are sure to bring comfort to the weary and guidance to all of us who, from time to time, lose our way.
