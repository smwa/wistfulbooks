{"title": "Wild Life on the Rockies", "description": "\"This book contains the record of a few of the many happy days and novel experiences which I have had in the wilds. For more than twenty years it has been my good fortune to live most of the time with nature, on the mountains of the West. I have made scores of long exploring rambles over the mountains in every season of the year, a nature-lover charmed with the birds and the trees. On my later excursions I have gone alone and without firearms. During three succeeding winters, in which I was a Government Experiment Officer and called the \"State Snow Observer,\" I scaled many of the higher peaks of the Rockies and made many studies on the upper slopes of these mountains.\" (Summary from the Preface of <i>Wild Life on the Rockies</i>)", "duration": 15738, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "4805", "name": " Enos A.
