In response Jerome asserts three propositions against Helvidius:\n<br><br>\n1) That Joseph was only putatively, not really, the husband of Mary. <br>\n2) That the \u201cbrethren\u201d of the Lord were his cousins, not his own brethren. <br>\n3) That virginity is better than the married state. <br>\n - Summary from the preface", "duration": 4183, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "14959", "name": "Saint Jerome"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/perpetual_virginity_blessed_mary_2104_librivox/perpetual_virginity_2104.jpg", "copyright_year": "1893", "genres": ["Christianity - Other"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "ancientchristian"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "ancientchristian"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Ann Boulais"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Ann Boulais"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Preface.
