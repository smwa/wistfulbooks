{"title": "Jolly Corner", "description": "\"The Jolly Corner,\" published in 1908, is considered by many to be a ghost story ranking second only to \"The Turn of the Screw.\" James\u2019s protagonist, Spencer Brydon, is an American of 56, returned to New York after 33 years in Europe, where he has apparently accomplished little while living off his New York rentals. His friendship with Alice Staverton, and his engagement in the development of a property awaken him to the possibilities that might have been his, had he chosen a different course of life. The \"ghost,\" if that\u2019s what it is, is that other self that might have been, and his confrontation with that self and its possibilities leads to a deeply unsettling, yet ambiguous, conclusion.", "duration": 5743, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "117", "name": "Henry James"}], "coverArt": "http://archive.org/download/jolly_corner_0908_librivox/Jolly_Corner_1205.jpg", "copyright_year": "1908", "genres": ["Horror & Supernatural Fiction"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Nicholas Clifford (1930-2019)"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Nicholas Clifford (1930-2019)"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Anna Simon"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Diana Majlinger"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Chapter 1", "readers": [4018], "path": "http://archive.org/download/jolly_corner_0908_librivox/jollycorner_01_james_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1979}, {"section": 2, "title": "Chapter 2", "readers": [4018], "path": "http://archive.org/download/jolly_corner_0908_librivox/jollycorner_02_james_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2909}, {"section": 3, "title": "Chapter 3", "readers": [4018], "path": "http://archive.org/download/jolly_corner_0908_librivox/jollycorner_03_james_64kb.mp3", "duration": 855}]}
