{"title": "Shan Folk Lore Stories from the Hill and Water Country", "description": "The following stories have been taken from the great[v] mass of unwritten lore that is to the black-eyed, brown-skinned boys and girls of the Shan mountain country of Burma what \"Jack the Giant Killer\" and \"Cinderella\" are to our own children.<br><br>\n\nThe old saw as to the songs and laws of a country may or may not be true. I feel confident, however, that stories such as these, being as they are purely native, with as little admixture of Western ideas as it was possible to give them in dressing them in their garment of English words, will give a better insight into what the native of Burma really is, his modes of thought and ways of looking at and measuring things, than a treatise thrice as long and representing infinitely more literary merit than will be found in these little tales; and at the same time I hope they will be found to the average reader, at least, more interesting. -- from the author's introduction - Summary by Larry Wilson", "duration": 10416, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "14273", "name": "William Charles Griggs"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/librivoxcCDCoverArt35/shanfolkstories_2004.jpg", "copyright_year": "1902", "genres": ["Culture & Heritage Fiction", "Myths", "Legends & Fairy Tales"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Larry Wilson"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "J.
