{"title": "Dr. Sam", "description": "Eugene Field, Sr. was an American writer, best known for his children's poetry and humorous essays.\nField first started publishing poetry in 1879, when his poem \"Christmas Treasures\" appeared in A Little Book of Western Verse. Over a dozen volumes of poetry followed and he became well known for his light-hearted poems for children, among the most famous of which are \"Wynken, Blynken, and Nod\" and \"The Duel\" (which is perhaps better known as \"The Gingham Dog and the Calico Cat\"). Equally famous is his poem about the death of a child, \"Little Boy Blue\". Field also published a number of short stories, including \"The Holy Cross\" and \"Daniel and the Devil.\" - Summary by Wikipedia", "duration": 1154, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "614", "name": "Eugene Field"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/dr_sam_1606.poem_librivox/dr_sam_1606.jpg", "copyright_year": "1896", "genres": ["Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Dr. Sam - Read by AV", "readers": [10913], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/dr_sam_1606.poem_librivox/drsam_field_av_64kb.mp3", "duration": 127}, {"section": 2, "title": "Dr. Sam - Read by BSD", "readers": [10402], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/dr_sam_1606.poem_librivox/drsam_field_bsd_64kb.mp3", "duration": 156}, {"section": 3, "title": "Dr. Sam - Read by DL", "readers": [2911], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/dr_sam_1606.poem_librivox/drsam_field_dl_64kb.mp3", "duration": 141}, {"section": 4, "title": "Dr. Sam - Read by MSD", "readers": [10891], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/dr_sam_1606.poem_librivox/drsam_field_msd_64kb.mp3", "duration": 143}, {"section": 5, "title": "Dr. Sam - Read by GG", "readers": [8011], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/dr_sam_1606.poem_librivox/drsam_field_gg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 170}, {"section": 6, "title": "Dr. Sam - Read by CLP", "readers": [9642], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/dr_sam_1606.poem_librivox/drsam_field_clp_64kb.mp3", "duration": 129}, {"section": 7, "title": "Dr. Sam - Read by LLW", "readers": [4738], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/dr_sam_1606.poem_librivox/drsam_field_llw_64kb.mp3", "duration": 163}, {"section": 8, "title": "Dr. Sam - Read by TP", "readers": [10789], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/dr_sam_1606.poem_librivox/drsam_field_tp_64kb.mp3", "duration": 125}]}
