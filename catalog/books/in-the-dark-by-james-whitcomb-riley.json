{"title": "In The Dark", "description": "James Whitcomb Riley was an American writer, poet, and best-selling author. During his lifetime he was known as the \"Hoosier Poet\" and \"Children's Poet\" for his dialect works and his children's poetry respectively. His poems tended to be humorous or sentimental, and of the approximately one thousand poems that Riley authored, the majority are in dialect.<br /><br />\n\nRiley began his career writing verses as a sign maker and submitting poetry to newspapers. Thanks in part to an endorsement from poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, he eventually earned successive jobs at Indiana newspaper publishers during the latter 1870s.<br /><br />\n\nRiley became a bestselling author in the 1890s. His children's poems were compiled into a book and illustrated by Howard Chandler Christy. Titled the Rhymes of Childhood, the book was his most popular and sold millions of copies. As a poet, Riley achieved an uncommon level of fame during his own lifetime.  - Summary by Wikipedia", "duration": 1261, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "1609", "name": "James Whitcomb Riley"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt22/In_Dark_1508.jpg", "copyright_year": "0", "genres": ["Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "In The Dark - Read by BK", "readers": [8786], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/in_the_dark_1508.poem_librivox/inthedark_riley_bk_64kb.mp3", "duration": 96}, {"section": 2, "title": "In The Dark - Read by CLP", "readers": [9642], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/in_the_dark_1508.poem_librivox/inthedark_riley_clp_64kb.mp3", "duration": 71}, {"section": 3, "title": "In The Dark - Read by DEF", "readers": [9698], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/in_the_dark_1508.poem_librivox/inthedark_riley_def_64kb.mp3", "duration": 90}, {"section": 4, "title": "In The Dark - Read by DL", "readers": [2911], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/in_the_dark_1508.poem_librivox/inthedark_riley_dl_64kb.mp3", "duration": 81}, {"section": 5, "title": "In The Dark - Read by EK", "readers": [10148], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/in_the_dark_1508.poem_librivox/inthedark_riley_ek_64kb.mp3", "duration": 85}, {"section": 6, "title": "In The Dark - Read by EL", "readers": [9872], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/in_the_dark_1508.poem_librivox/inthedark_riley_el_64kb.mp3", "duration": 82}, {"section": 7, "title": "In The Dark - Read by GB", "readers": [4969], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/in_the_dark_1508.poem_librivox/inthedark_riley_gb_64kb.mp3", "duration": 94}, {"section": 8, "title": "In The Dark - Read by JM", "readers": [9902], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/in_the_dark_1508.poem_librivox/inthedark_riley_jm_64kb.mp3", "duration": 79}, {"section": 9, "title": "In The Dark - Read by LAH", "readers": [1212], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/in_the_dark_1508.poem_librivox/inthedark_riley_lah_64kb.mp3", "duration": 74}, {"section": 10, "title": "In The Dark - Read by LCW", "readers": [8425], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/in_the_dark_1508.poem_librivox/inthedark_riley_lcw_64kb.mp3", "duration": 83}, {"section": 11, "title": "In The Dark - Read by LLW", "readers": [4738], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/in_the_dark_1508.poem_librivox/inthedark_riley_llw_64kb.mp3", "duration": 98}, {"section": 12, "title": "In The Dark - Read by NB", "readers": [6965], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/in_the_dark_1508.poem_librivox/inthedark_riley_nb_64kb.mp3", "duration": 91}, {"section": 13, "title": "In The Dark - Read by RD", "readers": [2297], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/in_the_dark_1508.poem_librivox/inthedark_riley_rd_64kb.mp3", "duration": 81}, {"section": 14, "title": "In The Dark - Read by SABT", "readers": [8932], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/in_the_dark_1508.poem_librivox/inthedark_riley_sabt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 84}, {"section": 15, "title": "In The Dark - Read by SM", "readers": [10285], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/in_the_dark_1508.poem_librivox/inthedark_riley_sm_64kb.mp3", "duration": 72}]}
