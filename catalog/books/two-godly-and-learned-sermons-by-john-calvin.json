{"title": "Two Godly and Learned Sermons", "description": "Two godly and learned sermons, made by that famous and worthy instrument in God's church, John Calvin. Which sermons were long since translated out of Latin into English, by Robert Horne late Bishop of Winchester, at what time he suffered exile from his country, for the testimony of a good conscience, as his Apology in the beginning of the book will witness. And because these sermons have long lain hidden in silence, and many godly and religious persons, have been very desirous of them: at their earnest request they are now published.
