{"title": "Jessie Pope's War Poems", "description": "Jessie Pope published these poems during the early months of the First World War. They were very popular at the time and the author received many letters of support and gratitude including some from men serving at the Front. The poems illustrate the patriotic and optimistic (and perhaps rather naive) view of the war which many people had at the time.\r\n\r\nLater soldier poets like Wilfred Owen and Siegfried Sassoon, who had personal experience of the conflict, painted a grimmer picture. Owen\u2019s poem \u201cDulce et Decorum Est\u201d was initially dedicated to Pope (\"to a certain lady poetess\") as a direct rebuttal of her view of the war.\r\n\r\n(Summary by Alan Mapstone)", "duration": 2955, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "10398", "name": "Jessie Pope"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/warpoems_2506_librivox/jessie_pope_2506.jpg", "copyright_year": "1915", "genres": ["Lyric"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Alan Mapstone"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Alan Mapstone"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Amy Gramour"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Bruce Kachuk"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "The K.A.
