{"title": "Bible (ASV) NT 23: 1 John", "description": "The First Epistle of John is a book of the Bible New Testament, the fourth of the catholic or \"general\" epistles. It was written in Ephesus about 90-110 AD, apparently by the same author or authors who wrote the Gospel of John and the other two epistles of John. Not actually a letter, it is a sermon written to counter the heresy that Jesus did not come \"in the flesh\" but only as a spirit. It also defines how Christians are to discern true teachers: by their ethics, their proclamation of Jesus in the flesh, and by their love.
