{"title": "Heavenly Bodies: Their Nature and Habitability", "description": "Few subjects could be mentioned more remote from the common interests and pursuits of life than what has been usually called the \u201cplurality of worlds,\u201d an expression now so long restricted to one well-ascertained meaning as to have lost any ambiguity that might have been charged upon it. The question is one of mere curiosity, and leads to no direct result; but it has always carried with it an attraction irrespective of its unpractical nature, and has exercised the ingenuity of so many minds that its literature is of no inconsiderable extent. To this the book now in our hands is the most recent contribution. - Summary by Nature, August 9, 1883", "duration": 39017, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "18781", "name": "William Miller"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/heavenlybodies_2504_librivox/heavenly_bodies_2505.jpg", "copyright_year": "1883", "genres": ["Astronomy", "Physics & Mechanics"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "InTheDesert"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "J.
