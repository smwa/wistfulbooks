Wherever he worked his gifted and unique personality was a center of inspiration\u2026  one would like to see his honorable place as a man of letters more generally understood. His generous wisdom and infectious enthusiasm are delightfully expressed in his collected writings\u2026.  His lucid and exquisite prose, with its extraordinary wealth of quotation from the literature of all ages, and his unfailing humor and tenderness, put him in the first rank of didactic essayists\u2026.  Rich in every gentle quality that makes life endeared, his books are the most sagacious and helpful of modern writings\u2026\"  - Summary by Christopher Morley, Modern Essays, 1921, and David Wales", "duration": 40567, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "9751", "name": "Sir William  Osler"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/alabamastudent_1610_librivox/alabamastudent_1610.jpg", "copyright_year": "1908", "genres": ["Biography & Autobiography", "Medical"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "David Wales"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "David Wales"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "TriciaG"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "DaveC"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Preface", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/alabamastudent_1610_librivox/alabamastudent_00_osler_64kb.mp3", "duration": 110}, {"section": 1, "title": "An Alabama Student", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/alabamastudent_1610_librivox/alabamastudent_01_osler_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2479}, {"section": 2, "title": "Thomas Dover, Physician And Buccaneer", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/alabamastudent_1610_librivox/alabamastudent_02_osler_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2405}, {"section": 3, "title": "John Keats, The Apothecary Poet", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/alabamastudent_1610_librivox/alabamastudent_03_osler_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2190}, {"section": 4, "title": "Oliver Wendell Holmes", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/alabamastudent_1610_librivox/alabamastudent_04_osler_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1297}, {"section": 5, "title": "John Locke As A Physician   Part 1", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/alabamastudent_1610_librivox/alabamastudent_05_osler_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2383}, {"section": 6, "title": "John Locke As A Physician   Part 2", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/alabamastudent_1610_librivox/alabamastudent_06_osler_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1436}, {"section": 7, "title": "Elisha Bartlett, A Rhode Island Philosopher  Part 1", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/alabamastudent_1610_librivox/alabamastudent_07_osler_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3186}, {"section": 8, "title": "Elisha Bartlett, A Rhode Island Philosopher  Part 2  (Including an Appendix, A Sketch Of Hippocrates)", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/alabamastudent_1610_librivox/alabamastudent_08_osler_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3517}, {"section": 9, "title": "A Backwood Physiologist  Part 1", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/alabamastudent_1610_librivox/alabamastudent_09_osler_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2272}, {"section": 10, "title": "A Backwood Physiologist  Part 2", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/alabamastudent_1610_librivox/alabamastudent_10_osler_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1760}, {"section": 11, "title": "The Influence Of Louis On American Medicine", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/alabamastudent_1610_librivox/alabamastudent_11_osler_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2883}, {"section": 12, "title": "William Pepper", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/alabamastudent_1610_librivox/alabamastudent_12_osler_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2564}, {"section": 13, "title": "Alfred Stille", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/alabamastudent_1610_librivox/alabamastudent_13_osler_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2127}, {"section": 14, "title": "Sir Thomas Browne Part 1", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/alabamastudent_1610_librivox/alabamastudent_14_osler_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1927}, {"section": 15, "title": "Sir Thomas Browne Part 2", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/alabamastudent_1610_librivox/alabamastudent_15_osler_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1495}, {"section": 16, "title": "Fracastorius", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/alabamastudent_1610_librivox/alabamastudent_16_osler_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1787}, {"section": 17, "title": "Harvey And His Discovery Part 1", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/alabamastudent_1610_librivox/alabamastudent_17_osler_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2510}, {"section": 18, "title": "Harvey And His Discovery Part 2", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/alabamastudent_1610_librivox/alabamastudent_18_osler_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2239}]}
