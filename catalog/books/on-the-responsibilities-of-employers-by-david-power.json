{"title": "On the Responsibilities of Employers", "description": "This volume is one of the series of 'Small Books on Great Subjects' published by Mr. Pickering. Its object is to create a better feeling than now exists between employers and employed, by raising the character and condition of workmen, labourers, and domestic servants, through the exertions of their employers. The writer depends only upon moral means; economical questions, such as the rate of wages, being designedly left untouched. He points out how his object may be accomplished, by selecting instances where it has been accomplished, by clergymen of a few parishes through the means of schools, or when the masters of large establishments sympathize with their people, and assist them by social superintendence as well as by an outlay for their benefit, though repaid in the form of rent etc. As calling attention to an important subject, stimulating the public mind, and guiding such persons as wish to benefit their people but are doubtful as to the mode, the book will be useful. - Summary by Spectator, August 18, 1849", "duration": 14018, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "19293", "name": "David Power"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/ontheresponsibilitiesofemployers_2601_librivox/responsibilitiesemployers_2601.jpg", "copyright_year": "1849", "genres": ["Business & Economics"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "InTheDesert"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Christine Rottger"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "InTheDesert"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Introduction", "readers": [19584], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ontheresponsibilitiesofemployers_2601_librivox/ontheresponsibilitiesofemployers_01_power_64kb.mp3", "duration": 577}, {"section": 2, "title": "The Present State of Feeling between Employers and the Employed", "readers": [19556], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ontheresponsibilitiesofemployers_2601_librivox/ontheresponsibilitiesofemployers_02_power_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1415}, {"section": 3, "title": "The Duty of Employers towards the Employed Part 1", "readers": [19584], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ontheresponsibilitiesofemployers_2601_librivox/ontheresponsibilitiesofemployers_03_power_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1218}, {"section": 4, "title": "The Duty of Employers towards the Employed Part 2", "readers": [19556], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ontheresponsibilitiesofemployers_2601_librivox/ontheresponsibilitiesofemployers_04_power_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1140}, {"section": 5, "title": "The Manufacturing Operatives Part 1", "readers": [19556], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ontheresponsibilitiesofemployers_2601_librivox/ontheresponsibilitiesofemployers_05_power_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1583}, {"section": 6, "title": "The Manufacturing Operatives Part 2", "readers": [19556], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ontheresponsibilitiesofemployers_2601_librivox/ontheresponsibilitiesofemployers_06_power_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2115}, {"section": 7, "title": "The Manufacturing Operatives Part 3", "readers": [18946], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ontheresponsibilitiesofemployers_2601_librivox/ontheresponsibilitiesofemployers_07_power_64kb.mp3", "duration": 691}, {"section": 8, "title": "The Agricultural Labourers Part 1", "readers": [10159], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ontheresponsibilitiesofemployers_2601_librivox/ontheresponsibilitiesofemployers_08_power_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1307}, {"section": 9, "title": "The Agricultural Labourers Part 2", "readers": [10159], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ontheresponsibilitiesofemployers_2601_librivox/ontheresponsibilitiesofemployers_09_power_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1120}, {"section": 10, "title": "On those employed in Shops, &c.", "readers": [19584], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ontheresponsibilitiesofemployers_2601_librivox/ontheresponsibilitiesofemployers_10_power_64kb.mp3", "duration": 774}, {"section": 11, "title": "Domestic Servants", "readers": [20345], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/ontheresponsibilitiesofemployers_2601_librivox/ontheresponsibilitiesofemployers_11_power_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2078}]}
