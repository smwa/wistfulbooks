{"title": "Selected Essays", "description": "Voltairine de Cleyre (1866\u20131912) was, according to Emma Goldman, \"the most gifted and brilliant anarchist woman America ever produced.\" Today she is not widely known as a consequence of her short life. De Cleyre was especially influenced by Thomas Paine, Mary Wollstonecraft and Clarence Darrow. After the hanging of the Haymarket protesters in 1887, she became an anarchist. \"Till then I believed in the essential justice of the American law of trial by jury,\" she wrote in an autobiographical essay, \"After that I never could.\" She was known as an excellent speaker and writer \u2013 in the opinion of biographer Paul Avrich, she was \"a greater literary talent than any other American anarchist\" \u2013 and as a tireless advocate for the anarchist cause, whose \"religious zeal,\" according to Goldman, \"stamped everything she did.\" (Wikipedia)", "duration": 44832, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "457", "name": "Voltairine de Cleyre"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt22/Selected_Essays_1209.jpg", "copyright_year": "1914", "genres": ["Essays & Short Works", "Philosophy", "Political Science"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Carl Manchester"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Carl Manchester"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "The Dominant Idea", "readers": [2269], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/essays_1002_librivox/essays_01_decleyre_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2512}, {"section": 2, "title": "Anarchism", "readers": [2269], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/essays_1002_librivox/essays_02_decleyre_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3004}, {"section": 3, "title": "Anarchism and American Traditions", "readers": [2269], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/essays_1002_librivox/essays_03_decleyre_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2459}, {"section": 4, "title": "Anarchism in Literature", "readers": [2269], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/essays_1002_librivox/essays_04_decleyre_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2482}, {"section": 5, "title": "The Making of an Anarchist", "readers": [2297], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/essays_1002_librivox/essays_05_decleyre_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1229}, {"section": 6, "title": "The 11th November 1887", "readers": [2269], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/essays_1002_librivox/essays_06_decleyre_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1167}, {"section": 7, "title": "Crime and Punishment, part 1", "readers": [296], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/essays_1002_librivox/essays_07_decleyre_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2031}, {"section": 8, "title": "Crime and Punishment, part 2", "readers": [296], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/essays_1002_librivox/essays_08_decleyre_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2094}, {"section": 9, "title": "In Defense of Emma Goldman", "readers": [1361], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/essays_1002_librivox/essays_09_decleyre_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1882}, {"section": 10, "title": "Direct Action", "readers": [1361], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/essays_1002_librivox/essays_10_decleyre_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2966}, {"section": 11, "title": "The Paris Commune", "readers": [296], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/essays_1002_librivox/essays_11_decleyre_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1249}, {"section": 12, "title": "The Mexican Revolution", "readers": [1401], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/essays_1002_librivox/essays_12_decleyre_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2312}, {"section": 13, "title": "Thomas Paine", "readers": [3426], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/essays_1002_librivox/essays_13_decleyre_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1044}, {"section": 14, "title": "Dyer D.
