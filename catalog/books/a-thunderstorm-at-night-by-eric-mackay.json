{"title": "Thunderstorm at Night", "description": "George Eric Mackay was an English minor poet, now remembered as the sponging half-brother of Marie Corelli, the best-selling novelist. Mackay and Corelli, born Mary Mackay, were the children of Charles Mackay, by different mothers.\n\nAs a poet he is described as \"execrable\", and reliant on Corelli's promotion of his works. Mackay achieved some reputation in his time for Letters of a Violinist (1886). It sold 35,000 copies; he repaid Corelli's efforts by implying he wrote her novels. - Summary by Wikipedia", "duration": 1030, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "2329", "name": "Eric Mackay"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/a_thunderstorm_at_night_1606.poem_librivox/thunderstorm_night_mackay_1606.jpg", "copyright_year": "1894", "genres": ["Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "David Lawrence"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "A Thunderstorm at Night - Read by BK", "readers": [8786], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/a_thunderstorm_at_night_1606.poem_librivox/thunderstorm_mackay_bk_64kb.mp3", "duration": 82}, {"section": 2, "title": "A Thunderstorm at Night - Read by BSD", "readers": [10402], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/a_thunderstorm_at_night_1606.poem_librivox/thunderstorm_mackay_bsd_64kb.mp3", "duration": 75}, {"section": 3, "title": "A Thunderstorm at Night - Read by DL", "readers": [2911], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/a_thunderstorm_at_night_1606.poem_librivox/thunderstorm_mackay_dl_64kb.mp3", "duration": 67}, {"section": 4, "title": "A Thunderstorm at Night - Read by EBS", "readers": [8886], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/a_thunderstorm_at_night_1606.poem_librivox/thunderstorm_mackay_ebs_64kb.mp3", "duration": 81}, {"section": 5, "title": "A Thunderstorm at Night - Read by EL", "readers": [9872], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/a_thunderstorm_at_night_1606.poem_librivox/thunderstorm_mackay_el_64kb.mp3", "duration": 58}, {"section": 6, "title": "A Thunderstorm at Night - Read by GB", "readers": [4969], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/a_thunderstorm_at_night_1606.poem_librivox/thunderstorm_mackay_gb_64kb.mp3", "duration": 78}, {"section": 7, "title": "A Thunderstorm at Night - Read by GC", "readers": [5890], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/a_thunderstorm_at_night_1606.poem_librivox/thunderstorm_mackay_gc_64kb.mp3", "duration": 60}, {"section": 8, "title": "A Thunderstorm at Night - Read by GG", "readers": [8011], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/a_thunderstorm_at_night_1606.poem_librivox/thunderstorm_mackay_gg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 87}, {"section": 9, "title": "A Thunderstorm at Night - Read by LAH", "readers": [1212], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/a_thunderstorm_at_night_1606.poem_librivox/thunderstorm_mackay_lah_64kb.mp3", "duration": 73}, {"section": 10, "title": "A Thunderstorm at Night - Read by LLW", "readers": [4738], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/a_thunderstorm_at_night_1606.poem_librivox/thunderstorm_mackay_llw_64kb.mp3", "duration": 78}, {"section": 11, "title": "A Thunderstorm at Night - Read by MK", "readers": [8051], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/a_thunderstorm_at_night_1606.poem_librivox/thunderstorm_mackay_mk_64kb.mp3", "duration": 91}, {"section": 12, "title": "A Thunderstorm at Night - Read by MSD", "readers": [10891], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/a_thunderstorm_at_night_1606.poem_librivox/thunderstorm_mackay_msd_64kb.mp3", "duration": 63}, {"section": 13, "title": "A Thunderstorm at Night - Read by SABT", "readers": [8932], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/a_thunderstorm_at_night_1606.poem_librivox/thunderstorm_mackay_sabt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 71}, {"section": 14, "title": "A Thunderstorm at Night - Read by TP", "readers": [10789], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/a_thunderstorm_at_night_1606.poem_librivox/thunderstorm_mackay_tp_64kb.mp3", "duration": 66}]}
