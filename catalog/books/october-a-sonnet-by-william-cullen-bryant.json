{"title": "October - A Sonnet", "description": "William Cullen Bryant was an American romantic poet, journalist, and long-time editor of the New York Evening Post. Bryant edited the very successful Picturesque America which was published between 1872 and 1874. This two-volume set was lavishly illustrated and described scenic places in the United States and Canada.\nIn his last decade, Bryant shifted from writing his own poetry to a blank verse translation of Homer's works. He assiduously worked on the Iliad and The Odyssey from 1871 to 1874. He is also remembered as one of the principal authorities on homeopathy and as a hymnist for the Unitarian Church, both legacies of his father's enormous influence on him. - Summary by Wikipedia", "duration": 1349, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "1343", "name": "William Cullen Bryant"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/october_a_sonnet_1610.poem_librivox/october_1610.jpg", "copyright_year": "1854", "genres": ["Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "October - A Sonnet - Read by ALP", "readers": [4705], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/october_a_sonnet_1610.poem_librivox/october_bryant_alp_64kb.mp3", "duration": 76}, {"section": 2, "title": "October - A Sonnet - Read by BK", "readers": [8786], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/october_a_sonnet_1610.poem_librivox/october_bryant_bk_64kb.mp3", "duration": 86}, {"section": 3, "title": "October - A Sonnet - Read by BLM", "readers": [11200], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/october_a_sonnet_1610.poem_librivox/october_bryant_blm_64kb.mp3", "duration": 55}, {"section": 4, "title": "October - A Sonnet - Read by DL", "readers": [2911], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/october_a_sonnet_1610.poem_librivox/october_bryant_dl_64kb.mp3", "duration": 71}, {"section": 5, "title": "October - A Sonnet - Read by EMS", "readers": [11169], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/october_a_sonnet_1610.poem_librivox/october_bryant_ems_64kb.mp3", "duration": 81}, {"section": 6, "title": "October - A Sonnet - Read by GB", "readers": [4969], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/october_a_sonnet_1610.poem_librivox/october_bryant_gb_64kb.mp3", "duration": 81}, {"section": 7, "title": "October - A Sonnet - Read by GG", "readers": [8011], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/october_a_sonnet_1610.poem_librivox/october_bryant_gg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 88}, {"section": 8, "title": "October - A Sonnet - Read by IK", "readers": [7785], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/october_a_sonnet_1610.poem_librivox/october_bryant_ik_64kb.mp3", "duration": 79}, {"section": 9, "title": "October - A Sonnet - Read by JH", "readers": [10205], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/october_a_sonnet_1610.poem_librivox/october_bryant_jh_64kb.mp3", "duration": 85}, {"section": 10, "title": "October - A Sonnet - Read by JN", "readers": [11235], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/october_a_sonnet_1610.poem_librivox/october_bryant_jn_64kb.mp3", "duration": 64}, {"section": 11, "title": "October - A Sonnet - Read by KGR", "readers": [9478], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/october_a_sonnet_1610.poem_librivox/october_bryant_kgr_64kb.mp3", "duration": 77}, {"section": 12, "title": "October - A Sonnet - Read by LAH", "readers": [1212], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/october_a_sonnet_1610.poem_librivox/october_bryant_lah_64kb.mp3", "duration": 76}, {"section": 13, "title": "October - A Sonnet - Read by MK", "readers": [8051], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/october_a_sonnet_1610.poem_librivox/october_bryant_mk_64kb.mp3", "duration": 82}, {"section": 14, "title": "October - A Sonnet - Read by MSD", "readers": [10891], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/october_a_sonnet_1610.poem_librivox/october_bryant_msd_64kb.mp3", "duration": 65}, {"section": 15, "title": "October - A Sonnet - Read by RC", "readers": [9331], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/october_a_sonnet_1610.poem_librivox/october_bryant_rc_64kb.mp3", "duration": 81}, {"section": 16, "title": "October - A Sonnet - Read by TP", "readers": [10789], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/october_a_sonnet_1610.poem_librivox/october_bryant_tp_64kb.mp3", "duration": 65}, {"section": 17, "title": "October - A Sonnet - Read by TRG", "readers": [11218], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/october_a_sonnet_1610.poem_librivox/october_bryant_trg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 65}, {"section": 18, "title": "October - A Sonnet - Read by VB", "readers": [8169], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/october_a_sonnet_1610.poem_librivox/october_bryant_vb_64kb.mp3", "duration": 72}]}
