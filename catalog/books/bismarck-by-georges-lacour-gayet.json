{"title": "Bismarck", "description": "Otto von Bismarck (1815-1898) famously said, \"The great questions of the day will not be settled by speeches or the decisions of the majority...but by iron and blood.\" Prince Bismarck unified the German states under Prussian hegemony through a series of carefully orchestrated wars, which excluded Austria from the new Confederation and added Schleswig-Holstein, and Alsace-Lorraine to Germany. But Bismarck avoided useless confrontations and was, above all, a master of balance of power diplomacy. His skills, both at home and abroad, won him the loyal support of Kaiser Wilhelm I. Paternalistic and socially conservative, Bismarck established for workers the very first government sickness, accident, and old-age insurance. This pithy, if pungent little biography was written in 1918 by the French historian, Georges Lacour-Gayet, who often lets Bismarck tell his story in his own inimitable words. - Summary by Pamela Nagami", "duration": 26454, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "12154", "name": "Georges Lacour-Gayet"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/bismarck_1608_librivox/bismarck_1608.jpg", "copyright_year": "1919", "genres": ["War & Military", "Biography & Autobiography"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Pamela Nagami"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Pamela Nagami"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "David Olson"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "DaveC"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Ch. 1: Years of Preparation, Pt. 1", "readers": [10191], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/bismarck_1608_librivox/bismarck_01_lacour-gayet_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1807}, {"section": 2, "title": "Ch. 1: Years of Preparation, Pt. 2", "readers": [10191], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/bismarck_1608_librivox/bismarck_02_lacour-gayet_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2032}, {"section": 3, "title": "Ch. 2: The First Passage of Arms, Pt. 1", "readers": [10191], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/bismarck_1608_librivox/bismarck_03_lacour-gayet_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1729}, {"section": 4, "title": "Ch. 2: The First Passage of Arms, Pt. 2", "readers": [10191], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/bismarck_1608_librivox/bismarck_04_lacour-gayet_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2248}, {"section": 5, "title": "Ch. 3: Sadowa, Pt. 1", "readers": [10191], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/bismarck_1608_librivox/bismarck_05_lacour-gayet_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2006}, {"section": 6, "title": "Ch. 3: Sadowa, Pt. 2", "readers": [10191], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/bismarck_1608_librivox/bismarck_06_lacour-gayet_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2145}, {"section": 7, "title": "Ch. 4: The War of 1870, Pt. 1", "readers": [10191], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/bismarck_1608_librivox/bismarck_07_lacour-gayet_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2047}, {"section": 8, "title": "Ch. 4: The War of 1870, Pt. 2", "readers": [10191], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/bismarck_1608_librivox/bismarck_08_lacour-gayet_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2393}, {"section": 9, "title": "Ch. 5: The German Empire, Pt. 1", "readers": [10191], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/bismarck_1608_librivox/bismarck_09_lacour-gayet_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2587}, {"section": 10, "title": "Ch. 5: The German Empire, Pt. 2", "readers": [10191], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/bismarck_1608_librivox/bismarck_10_lacour-gayet_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2162}, {"section": 11, "title": "Ch. 6: Last Fights, Pt. 1", "readers": [10191], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/bismarck_1608_librivox/bismarck_11_lacour-gayet_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2407}, {"section": 12, "title": "Ch. 6: Last Fights, Pt. 2", "readers": [10191], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/bismarck_1608_librivox/bismarck_12_lacour-gayet_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2891}]}
