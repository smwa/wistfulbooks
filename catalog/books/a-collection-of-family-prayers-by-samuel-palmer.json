{"title": "Collection of Family Prayers", "description": "That Family-prayer is an indispensible duty, and an important means of religion, are points which are here taken for granted. Among the many excuses commonly urged for the omission of this duty one of the most frequent is, the want of ability or courage to pray, in the presence of others. Where this is the case, the most natural and effectual answer is \"Make use of forms.\" The lawfulness and expediency of so doing, I shall not attempt to prove. It has been admitted by the best of our divines, several of whom have published forms of devotion for the use of families. It is a happiness that we have so many volumes of family-prayers, both by Churchmen and Dissenters, suited to the different tastes and sentiments of different persons. There is yet, however, room for more, as variety is pleasing and edifying. The occasional prayers are new compositions, which are adapted to the most common occurrences, and which may easily be altered as circumstances vary. In all, great attention has been paid to plainness and simplicity, both, of thought and expression. - Summary by Extracted from Preface", "duration": 16697, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id":
