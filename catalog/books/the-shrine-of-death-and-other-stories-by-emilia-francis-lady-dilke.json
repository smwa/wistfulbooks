{"title": "Shrine of Death and Other Stories", "description": "Lady Emilia Dilke was a renowned author, art historian and women's activist whose supernatural weird tales often had a haunting dreamlike quality to them, some reading as esoteric and tragic fables of life and love lost with a touch of the gothic.
