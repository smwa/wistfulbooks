{"title": "Castle-Builder", "description": "LibriVox volunteers bring you 20 recordings of The Castle-Builder by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.<br>\nThis was the Weekly Poetry project for  March 3, 2019.   <br> ------<br>\nHenry Wadsworth Longfellow was an American poet and educator whose works include \"Paul Revere's Ride\", The Song of Hiawatha, and Evangeline. He was also the first American to translate Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy and was one of the Fireside Poets from New England.\nLongfellow wrote many lyric poems known for their musicality and often presenting stories of mythology and legend. He became the most popular American poet of his day and also had success overseas. He has been criticized, however, for imitating European styles and writing specifically for the masses. - Summary by Wikipedia", "duration": 1514, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "43", "name": "Henry Wadsworth Longfellow"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/castle-builder_1903.poem_librivox/castlebuilder_1903.jpg", "copyright_year": "1902", "genres": ["Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "David Lawrence"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "The Castle-Builder - Read by BK", "readers": [8786], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/castle-builder_1903.poem_librivox/castlebuilder_longfellow_bk_64kb.mp3", "duration": 83}, {"section": 2, "title": "The Castle-Builder - Read by CM", "readers": [11990], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/castle-builder_1903.poem_librivox/castlebuilder_longfellow_cm_64kb.mp3", "duration": 89}, {"section": 3, "title": "The Castle-Builder - Read by CS", "readers": [13072], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/castle-builder_1903.poem_librivox/castlebuilder_longfellow_cs_64kb.mp3", "duration": 64}, {"section": 4, "title": "The Castle-Builder - Read by DL", "readers": [2911], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/castle-builder_1903.poem_librivox/castlebuilder_longfellow_dl_64kb.mp3", "duration": 77}, {"section": 5, "title": "The Castle-Builder - Read by DLV", "readers": [13062], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/castle-builder_1903.poem_librivox/castlebuilder_longfellow_dlv_64kb.mp3", "duration": 71}, {"section": 6, "title": "The Castle-Builder - Read by EL", "readers": [9872], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/castle-builder_1903.poem_librivox/castlebuilder_longfellow_el_64kb.mp3", "duration": 105}, {"section": 7, "title": "The Castle-Builder - Read by EYM", "readers": [13212], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/castle-builder_1903.poem_librivox/castlebuilder_longfellow_eym_64kb.mp3", "duration": 67}, {"section": 8, "title": "The Castle-Builder - Read by FH", "readers": [12500], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/castle-builder_1903.poem_librivox/castlebuilder_longfellow_fh_64kb.mp3", "duration": 78}, {"section": 9, "title": "The Castle-Builder - Read by GB", "readers": [4969], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/castle-builder_1903.poem_librivox/castlebuilder_longfellow_gb_64kb.mp3", "duration": 82}, {"section": 10, "title": "The Castle-Builder - Read by GG", "readers": [8011], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/castle-builder_1903.poem_librivox/castlebuilder_longfellow_gg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 80}, {"section": 11, "title": "The Castle-Builder - Read by GRS", "readers": [12484], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/castle-builder_1903.poem_librivox/castlebuilder_longfellow_grs_64kb.mp3", "duration": 80}, {"section": 12, "title": "The Castle-Builder - Read by IK", "readers": [7785], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/castle-builder_1903.poem_librivox/castlebuilder_longfellow_ik_64kb.mp3", "duration": 88}, {"section": 13, "title": "The Castle-Builder - Read by JFG", "readers": [12732], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/castle-builder_1903.poem_librivox/castlebuilder_longfellow_jfg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 67}, {"section": 14, "title": "The Castle-Builder - Read by JK", "readers": [13022], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/castle-builder_1903.poem_librivox/castlebuilder_longfellow_jk_64kb.mp3", "duration": 59}, {"section": 15, "title": "The Castle-Builder - Read by LCW", "readers": [8425], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/castle-builder_1903.poem_librivox/castlebuilder_longfellow_lcw_64kb.mp3", "duration": 70}, {"section": 16, "title": "The Castle-Builder - Read by MFC", "readers": [13208], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/castle-builder_1903.poem_librivox/castlebuilder_longfellow_mfc_64kb.mp3", "duration": 61}, {"section": 17, "title": "The Castle-Builder - Read by PS", "readers": [8576], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/castle-builder_1903.poem_librivox/castlebuilder_longfellow_ps_64kb.mp3", "duration": 69}, {"section": 18, "title": "The Castle-Builder - Read by RMSG", "readers": [13205], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/castle-builder_1903.poem_librivox/castlebuilder_longfellow_rmsg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 64}, {"section": 19, "title": "The Castle-Builder - Read by TP", "readers": [10789], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/castle-builder_1903.poem_librivox/castlebuilder_longfellow_tp_64kb.mp3", "duration": 79}, {"section": 20, "title": "The Castle-Builder - Read by VB", "readers": [8169], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/castle-builder_1903.poem_librivox/castlebuilder_longfellow_vb_64kb.mp3", "duration": 81}]}
