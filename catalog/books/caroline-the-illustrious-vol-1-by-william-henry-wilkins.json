{"title": "Caroline the Illustrious, Vol. 1", "description": "Caroline moved to England from Hanover when her father-in-law became George I and her husband Prince of Wales. She had a tumultuous relationship with the King, who was unpopular and ineffective. When her husband became George II, the relationship between the King and his people was even worse, a situation his Queen Consort attempted to mediate. For the ten years from his accession until her death, it was Caroline who, in effect, ruled the country. Wilkins argues that, apart from Elizabeth I, Caroline was the most powerful woman in English history. - Summary by LynneT", "duration": 37986, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "17735", "name": "William Henry Wilkins"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/carolinetheillustriousvol1_2401_librivox/caroline_illustrious1_2401.jpg", "copyright_year": "1901", "genres": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Lynne T"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Lynne T"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "PaulW"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Preface", "readers": [18576], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/carolinetheillustriousvol1_2401_librivox/caroline1_00_wilkins_64kb.mp3", "duration": 278}, {"section": 1, "title": "BOOK I.
