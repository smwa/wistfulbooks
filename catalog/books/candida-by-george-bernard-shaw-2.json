{"title": "Candida (version 2)", "description": "This play tells the story of Candida, the wife of a famous clergyman, the Reverend James Mavor Morell.   Morell is a Christian Socialist, popular in the Church of England, but Candida is responsible for much of his success. Candida returns home briefly from a trip to London with Eugene Marchbanks, a young poet who wants to rescue her from what he presumes to be her dull family life.\n\nMarchbanks is in love with Candida and believes she deserves something more than just complacency from her husband. He considers her divine, and his love eternal. In his view, it is quite improper and humiliating for Candida to have to attend to petty household chores. Morell believes Candida needs his care and protection, but the truth is quite the contrary. Ultimately, Candida must choose between the two gentlemen. She reasserts her preference for the \"weaker of the two\" who, after a momentary uncertainty, turns out to be her husband Morell.  Note that the pronunciation of Candida is how Shaw himself preferred it be pronounced.
