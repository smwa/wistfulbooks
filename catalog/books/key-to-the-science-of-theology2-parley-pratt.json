{"title": "Key to the Science of Theology (Version 2)", "description": "Written by Parley P. Pratt, a prominent early member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, commonly known as Mormons, \"Key to the Science of Theology\" was first published in 1855 and is considered a classic work of Mormon theology. The book covers a wide range of theological topics, beginning with a spiritual history of the Jews and Gentiles as they first gain and then lose knowledge of God, and then moving progressively into topics foundational to the expansive and peculiar cosmology of the Latter-day Saints. Pratt draws heavily on the scriptures, both Old and New Testaments as well as the LDS revelations, to persuade an audience of mixed religious traditions. One of the key themes of the book is the idea that God is a loving, personal being who is intimately involved in the lives of his children. Pratt emphasizes the importance of faith, repentance, and obedience to God's commandments in order to receive salvation and exaltation.
