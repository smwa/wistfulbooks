{"title": "Michigan Historical Collections, Volume 1", "description": "The Michigan Historical Society solicited accounts by Michigan pioneers about the early settlement of various locations, or early development of institutions in Michigan.  Many of these accounts were read to members of the society in the early 1870s at its regular meetings. This audiobook version includes only those articles from the volume that were judged to contain content of broad interest in the 21st century. In addition to biographical sketches, Volume 1 contains several papers concerning the early history of Detroit, and memoirs about primitive pioneer travel and life in the Michigan wilderness. - Summary by Ted Lienhart", "duration": 27696, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "19122", "name": " Historical Society of Michigan"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/michiganhistcollvol1_2507_librivox/michiganhistorical1_2507.jpg", "copyright_year": "1877", "genres": ["Memoirs", "Modern (19th C)", "Exploration"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Ted Lienhart"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Ted Lienhart"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Ann Boulais"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Temda"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Sketch of the Life of \"Uncle Harvey Williams\"", "readers": [17965], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/michiganhistcollvol1_2507_librivox/collectionsmichigan1_01_historicalsocietyofmichigan_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1006}, {"section": 2, "title": "Origin and Progress of the Michigan School System", "readers": [17965], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/michiganhistcollvol1_2507_librivox/collectionsmichigan1_02_historicalsocietyofmichigan_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2028}, {"section": 3, "title": "Internal Improvements", "readers": [17965], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/michiganhistcollvol1_2507_librivox/collectionsmichigan1_03_historicalsocietyofmichigan_64kb.mp3", "duration": 493}, {"section": 4, "title": "Incidents in the Black Hawk War", "readers": [17965], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/michiganhistcollvol1_2507_librivox/collectionsmichigan1_04_historicalsocietyofmichigan_64kb.mp3", "duration": 793}, {"section": 5, "title": "A Trip from Utica, New York, to Ingham County, Michigan", "readers": [17965], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/michiganhistcollvol1_2507_librivox/collectionsmichigan1_05_historicalsocietyofmichigan_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1271}, {"section": 6, "title": "The Early Colonization of Detroit Part 1", "readers": [17965], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/michiganhistcollvol1_2507_librivox/collectionsmichigan1_06_historicalsocietyofmichigan_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2193}, {"section": 7, "title": "The Early Colonization of Detroit Part 2", "readers": [17965], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/michiganhistcollvol1_2507_librivox/collectionsmichigan1_07_historicalsocietyofmichigan_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2141}, {"section": 8, "title": "Fort Shelby", "readers": [17965], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/michiganhistcollvol1_2507_librivox/collectionsmichigan1_08_historicalsocietyofmichigan_64kb.mp3", "duration": 749}, {"section": 9, "title": "Observations and Experiences in Michigan Forty Years Ago", "readers": [17965], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/michiganhistcollvol1_2507_librivox/collectionsmichigan1_09_historicalsocietyofmichigan_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1679}, {"section": 10, "title": "Wild Animals of Wayne County", "readers": [17965], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/michiganhistcollvol1_2507_librivox/collectionsmichigan1_10_historicalsocietyofmichigan_64kb.mp3", "duration": 614}, {"section": 11, "title": "Memoir of Luther Harvey", "readers": [17965], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/michiganhistcollvol1_2507_librivox/collectionsmichigan1_11_historicalsocietyofmichigan_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1839}, {"section": 12, "title": "Slavery in Detroit", "readers": [17965], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/michiganhistcollvol1_2507_librivox/collectionsmichigan1_12_historicalsocietyofmichigan_64kb.mp3", "duration": 636}, {"section": 13, "title": "Schools of Wayne County", "readers": [17965], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/michiganhistcollvol1_2507_librivox/collectionsmichigan1_13_historicalsocietyofmichigan_64kb.mp3", "duration": 494}, {"section": 14, "title": "Judge Zephaniah W.
