{"title": "House of a Thousand Candles", "description": "A top ten bestseller of 1906, <i>The House of a Thousand Candles</i> is part adventure/mystery and part romance. The book begins with young Jack Glenarm returning from various exploits in Europe and Africa for the reading of his grandfather\u2019s will. In it, he stands to inherit his grandfather\u2019s estate, but only if he can remain for one year in residence at the old man\u2019s unfinished \u201cHouse of a Thousand Candles\u201d in Annandale, Indiana, with only his grandfather\u2019s mysterious valet for company. If he violates the terms of the will, the house will go to a young woman, heretofore unknown to him, whom the will also forbids Jack to marry if he wants to retain his inheritance. This all sounds very mundane to Jack and he fully expects to be quite bored in very short order. Soon after Jack\u2019s arrival at Glenarm House, however, various strange occurrences ensue, and he soon finds himself absorbed in the most lively adventure of his life! (summary by J. M. Smallheer)", "duration": 26892, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "1823", "name": "Meredith Nicholson"}], "coverArt": "https://www.archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt5/House_of_a_Thousand_Candles_1005.jpg", "copyright_year": "1905", "genres": ["Action & Adventure Fiction", "Crime & Mystery Fiction"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "J.
