{"title": "Egypt of the Pharaohs and of the Khediv\u00e9", "description": "Those particulars of the History of Egypt, and of its present condition, in which it differs from other countries, are factors of the idea this famous name stands for, which must be brought prominently into view in any honest and useful construction of the idea. Something of this kind is what the author of the following work has been desirous of attempting, and so was unable, as he was also unwilling, to pass by any point, or question, which fell within the requirements of his design. His aim, throughout, has been to aid those who have not studied the subject much, or perhaps at all, in understanding what it is in the past, and in the present, that gives to Egypt a claim on their attention. The pictures of things, and the thoughts about them, which he offers to his readers, are the materials with which the idea of Egypt has been built up in his own mind: they will judge how far with, or without, reason.\r\n\r\nThe work had its origin in a tour the author made through the country in the early months of this year. It consists, indeed, of the thoughts that actually occurred to him at the time, and while the objects that called them forth were still before him; with, of course, some[x] pruning, and, here and there, some expansion or addition. They are presented to the reader with somewhat more of methodical arrangement than would have been possible had the hap-hazard sequence, in which the objects and places that suggested them were visited, been adhered to.\r\n\r\nAs he started for Egypt at a few hours\u2019 notice, it did not occur to him to take any books with him. This temporary absence of the means of reference, and verification, will, in some measure, account for the disposition manifested throughout to follow up the trains of thought Egyptian objects quicken in the beholder\u2019s mind. These excursus, however, as they will appear to those who take little interest in the internal, and ask only for the external, incidents of travel, have been retained, not merely because they were necessary for what came to be the design of the work, but also because, had they been excluded, the work would have ceased to be something real; for then it would not have been what it professes to be, that is, a transcript of the thoughts which the sights of Egypt actually gave rise to in the authors mind.\r\n\r\nWherstead Vicarage: May 13, 1871. - Summary by from the Introduction to the first edition.", "duration": 60950, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "18429", "name": "Chien Tao"}, {"id": "17992", "name": "Foster Barham Zincke"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/egyptofthepharaohs_2405_librivox/egypt_pharaohs_khedive_2405.jpg", "copyright_year": "1873", "genres": ["Travel & Geography", "Antiquity"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Lynne T"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Lynne T"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "mleigh"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Egypt and the Nile", "readers": [18616], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/egyptofthepharaohs_2405_librivox/egyptofthepharaohs_01_zincke_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1106}, {"section": 2, "title": "How in Egypt Nature affected Man", "readers": [18839], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/egyptofthepharaohs_2405_librivox/egyptofthepharaohs_02_zincke_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1569}, {"section": 3, "title": "Who were the Egyptians?", "readers": [18839], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/egyptofthepharaohs_2405_librivox/egyptofthepharaohs_03_zincke_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2058}, {"section": 4, "title": "Egypt the Japan of the Old World", "readers": [18146], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/egyptofthepharaohs_2405_librivox/egyptofthepharaohs_04_zincke_64kb.mp3", "duration": 299}, {"section": 5, "title": "Backsheesh.\u2014The Girl of Bethany", "readers": [18146], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/egyptofthepharaohs_2405_librivox/egyptofthepharaohs_05_zincke_64kb.mp3", "duration": 771}, {"section": 6, "title": "Antiquity and Character of the Pyramid Civilization", "readers": [18839], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/egyptofthepharaohs_2405_librivox/egyptofthepharaohs_06_zincke_64kb.mp3", "duration": 601}, {"section": 7, "title": "Labour was Squandered on the Pyramids because it could not be bottled up", "readers": [18146], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/egyptofthepharaohs_2405_librivox/egyptofthepharaohs_07_zincke_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1418}, {"section": 8, "title": "The Great Pyramid looks down on the Cataract of Phil\u00e6", "readers": [18146], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/egyptofthepharaohs_2405_librivox/egyptofthepharaohs_08_zincke_64kb.mp3", "duration": 223}, {"section": 9, "title": "The Wooden Statue in the Boulak Museum", "readers": [18146], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/egyptofthepharaohs_2405_librivox/egyptofthepharaohs_09_zincke_64kb.mp3", "duration": 357}, {"section": 10, "title": "Date of Building with Stone", "readers": [18146], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/egyptofthepharaohs_2405_librivox/egyptofthepharaohs_10_zincke_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1117}, {"section": 11, "title": "Going to the Top of the Great Pyramid", "readers": [18146], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/egyptofthepharaohs_2405_librivox/egyptofthepharaohs_11_zincke_64kb.mp3", "duration": 711}, {"section": 12, "title": "Luncheon at the Pyramids.
