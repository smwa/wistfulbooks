{"title": "Appeal to the Religion, Justice, and Humanity of the Inhabitants of the British Empire, in behalf of the Negro Slaves in the West Indies", "description": "An impassioned plea by Wilberforce about putting an end to slavery in the West Indies based on his view of the institution as a national disgrace and a moral hazard. He emphasized the need for British citizens to take action and demand an end to the practice as well as highlighting the need for religious leaders to step up and teach Christianity to slaves all across the West Indies. In Wilberforce's view, the most serious of all the vices of the West-Indian system was the nearly universal destitution of religious and moral instruction among the slaves.
