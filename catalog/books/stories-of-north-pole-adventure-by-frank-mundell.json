{"title": "Stories of North Pole Adventure", "description": "This volume does not pretend to be a history of Artic exploration. My aim has been to narrate some of the most thrilling incidents of Polar adventure in such a manner that the reader may feel something of the fascination which induces explorers, in spite of reverses and disasters, to attempt again and again to penetrate the vast region of snow and silence and solitude around the North Pole. Great care has been taken to ensure accuracy; and, wherever possible, the actual journals of the various expeditions have been consulted, besides a host of minor publications. (Preface by Frank Mundell).\n* * *\nStories of North Pole Adventure, was one in a series of inspirational texts and \u2018heroic writings\u2019 by the Victorian author Frank Mundell and published by The Sunday School Union.
