{"title": "Ministry of Disturbance", "description": "Science Fiction at it humorous best written in the golden age of all the greats and published in Astounding Science Fiction December 1958.  Piper can't be matched for sardonic comment on human nature.  The Empire is stagnant; thousands of planets spread around Earth but nothing new is allowed to happen and disturb the static situation.  Our emperor Paul knows this but is powerless to make a dent in the centuries old hide bound bureaucracy of intergalactic politics.  But is there a plot to overthrow him? It certainly looks like it. Follow this story closely as it builds to an excellent and exciting climax. Piper's talent and creativity shine through in this story.
