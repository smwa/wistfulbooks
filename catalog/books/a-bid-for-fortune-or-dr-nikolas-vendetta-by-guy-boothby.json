{"title": "Bid For Fortune; Or, Dr Nikola's Vendetta", "description": "Guy Newell Boothby (1867 \u2013 1905) was a prolific Australian writer. He moved to London in 1894 and became most well-known for his Dr.Nikola mysteries. This book is the first in a series of five and introduces the good doctor himself. Dr Nikola Is a criminal mastermind with an occult twist and like much fiction of that era this book and the following are more about how others fall under his spell and into his web. Here we have an adventure and love story that sweeps us from Australia, the South Seas, the Middle East and rural Hampshire with our lovestruck hero constantly battling against Dr Nikola and his cohorts. The sense of mystery and the exotic settings are exceptionally well portrayed and give the book a nostalgic appeal for the days of imperialists and hardened empire builders. - Summary by Peter Keeble", "duration": 27703, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "2512", "name": "Guy Boothby"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/a_bid_for_fortune_1511_librivox/bid_fortune_1511.jpg", "copyright_year": "1918", "genres": ["Detective Fiction"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Peter John Keeble"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Peter John Keeble"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Crln Yldz Ksr"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "bandbw123"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Prologue - Dr Nikola", "readers": [7228], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/a_bid_for_fortune_1511_librivox/bidforfortune_01_boothby_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1292}, {"section": 2, "title": "I determine to take a holiday - Sydney and what befel me there", "readers": [7228], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/a_bid_for_fortune_1511_librivox/bidforfortune_02_boothby_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2199}, {"section": 3, "title": "London", "readers": [7228], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/a_bid_for_fortune_1511_librivox/bidforfortune_03_boothby_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1597}, {"section": 4, "title": "I Visit my Relations", "readers": [7228], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/a_bid_for_fortune_1511_librivox/bidforfortune_04_boothby_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1741}, {"section": 5, "title": "I save an Important life", "readers": [7228], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/a_bid_for_fortune_1511_librivox/bidforfortune_05_boothby_64kb.mp3", "duration": 824}, {"section": 6, "title": "Mystery", "readers": [7228], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/a_bid_for_fortune_1511_librivox/bidforfortune_06_boothby_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1637}, {"section": 7, "title": "I meet Dr Nikola again", "readers": [7228], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/a_bid_for_fortune_1511_librivox/bidforfortune_07_boothby_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2022}, {"section": 8, "title": "Port Said and what befel us there", "readers": [7228], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/a_bid_for_fortune_1511_librivox/bidforfortune_08_boothby_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1625}, {"section": 9, "title": "Our imprisonment and attempt at escape", "readers": [7228], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/a_bid_for_fortune_1511_librivox/bidforfortune_09_boothby_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1577}, {"section": 10, "title": "Dr Nikola permits us a free pasage", "readers": [7228], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/a_bid_for_fortune_1511_librivox/bidforfortune_10_boothby_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1666}, {"section": 11, "title": "We Reach Australia and the Result", "readers": [7228], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/a_bid_for_fortune_1511_librivox/bidforfortune_11_boothby_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1697}, {"section": 12, "title": "On the Trail", "readers": [7228], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/a_bid_for_fortune_1511_librivox/bidforfortune_12_boothby_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1675}, {"section": 13, "title": "Lord Beckenham's Story", "readers": [7228], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/a_bid_for_fortune_1511_librivox/bidforfortune_13_boothby_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2109}, {"section": 14, "title": "Following up a Clue", "readers": [7228], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/a_bid_for_fortune_1511_librivox/bidforfortune_14_boothby_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2850}, {"section": 15, "title": "The Islands and what we found there", "readers": [7228], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/a_bid_for_fortune_1511_librivox/bidforfortune_15_boothby_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1783}, {"section": 16, "title": "Conclusion", "readers": [7228], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/a_bid_for_fortune_1511_librivox/bidforfortune_16_boothby_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1409}]}
