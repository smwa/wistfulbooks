{"title": "Haunted Woman", "description": "Isabel Loment is engaged to the affectionate, but unemotional, Marshall Stokes. House-hunting for her aunt, she comes to Runhill Court, an ancient home with a mysterious staircase that is only visible to those with eyes to see it. Ascending the staircase, she meets Henry Judge, the owner of Runhill Court, and a passionate relationship develops, which neither can recall once they have descended the staircase and returned to the everyday world. The Haunted Woman was Lindsay's attempt to write a more commercial novel than its fantasy predecessor, A Voyage to Arcturus. Though neither book was successful in its day, both became cult classics. The Haunted Woman was reprinted as the fourth volume of the celebrated Newcastle Forgotten Fantasy Library.
