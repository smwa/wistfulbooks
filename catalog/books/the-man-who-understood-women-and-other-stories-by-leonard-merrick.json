{"title": "Man who Understood Women, and Other Stories", "description": "This is a collection of 20 short stories by English novelist and playwright Leonard Merrick. The stories concern varied topics, and succeed to evoke a charming picture of England in the early 20th century. <br></br>It is surprising that Merrick's work is no longer known to the public, as he was one of the most highly regarded writers of his own time. William Dean Howells wrote of him, for instance, \"I can think of no recent fictionist of his nation who can quite match with Mr. Merrick in that excellence [of \"shapeliness\" or form in the novel]. This will seem great praise, possibly too great, to the few who have a sense of such excellence; but it will probably be without real meaning to most, though our public might well enjoy form if it could once be made to imagine it.\" (quoted in wikipedia). - Summary by Carolin", "duration": 36888, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "12456", "name": "Leonard Merrick"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/man_who_understood_women_1705_librivox/understood_1705.jpg", "copyright_year": "1919", "genres": ["Short Stories"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Crln Yldz Ksr"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Crln Yldz Ksr"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Kathrine Engan"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Introduction, by William J.
