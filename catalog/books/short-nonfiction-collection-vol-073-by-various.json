{"title": "Short Nonfiction Collection, Vol. 073", "description": "Twenty short nonfiction works chosen by the readers. \"Salve! ye dumb hearts. Let us be still and wait by the roadside.\" With these words, Kate Chopin decries the \"crushing feet, the clashing discords, the ruthless hands and stifling breath\u201d that power the \u201cmad pace\" of everyday life. Broadway: the Backbone of New York presents a more up-beat view of city life. Reflections on difficult times are the substance of several volume 073 readings (The Influenza Epidemic of 1918; Plague in Ireland in the Tudor Period; Soren Kierkegaard in his Life and Literature; and Remarks to Madame Curie); while the clash of people and cultures is examined in Everyday Japan (1903), the Passing of Princess Kaiulani, Inca Land, Northern Europe and the Swiss Confederation, the Struggle between the Teutonic Order and Poland, and Pan-Turanism. Individual response to life's stresses and demands is the theme of Women Friendships, The Unadmiring, Spittler's Prometheus and Epimetheus, and Martha Maxwell, Taxidermist. Imagining the pleasures of home, Robert Louis Stevenson, in his The Ideal House, writes that \"Bold rocks near hand are more inspiriting than distant Alps,\" and concludes \"even greatness can be found on the small scale; for the mind and the eye measure differently.\" The mind-eye divide is what allows the illusionist to create amusing hand shadows (Dog and Rabbit); the novelist to create worlds from words (John Galsworthy, A Notable Englishman); and the mathematician Sir William Rowan Hamilton, to inscribe, with his pocket knife, in the stone of Brougham Bridge, the fundamental formula for quaternion multiplication, which had come to him in a flash of inspiration as he was out walking with his wife.
