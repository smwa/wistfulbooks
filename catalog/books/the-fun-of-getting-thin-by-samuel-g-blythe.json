{"title": "Fun of Getting Thin", "description": "In this short, amusing book, subtitled \"How to Be Thin and Reduce The Waist Line,\" Samuel G. Blythe explains how he was able to lose, and keep off, 50 pounds, without resorting to fad diets or giving up the foods he loved. Over a hundred years later, his common-sense advice about food, drink and exercise still makes sense today. ***NOTE: It should be noted that there is language within this book that was commonplace during the time this book was written that is often considered offensive today.*** (Christine Lehman)", "duration": 2975, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "13543", "name": "Samuel G.
