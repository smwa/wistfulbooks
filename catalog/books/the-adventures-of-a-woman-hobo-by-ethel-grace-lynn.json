{"title": "Adventures of a Woman Hobo", "description": "Ethel and Dan Lynn wed in San Francisco in the immediate aftermath of the 1906 earthquake. The young couple soon moved to Chicago where she established a medical practice while he sought backing for a business based upon his invention. Within two years the move had proved disastrous. The Panic of 1907 dashed Dan's entrepreneurial dream and made it impossible for him to find steady work. Far worse, Ethel was diagnosed with tuberculosis and told she should return to California to improve her health. Their finances drained, they set out on a tandem bicycle that Dan retrofitted for the trek. This is Ethel's journal of their 1908 tramp across the western United States.<br><br>\r\n\r\nNOTE: There are issues of race in the telling of \"The Adventures Of A Woman Hobo\", particularly the use of an anti-black, derogatory term.
