{"title": "Selected Works of E. Boyd Smith", "description": "A sampling of the children's books written and illustrated by E. Boyd Smith.  The first story is Mr. Smith's version of the Story of Noah's Ark.  He then tells us the story of Pocahontas and Captain John Smith.  Next we join a hen as she hatches her chicks and their life on the farm.  We then go on several adventures with Bob and Betty as they visit their Uncle's farm, go to the seashore and learn about ships, and then learn about railroads and trains.  Our last story is a brief history of the United States up until the time just after World War I. - Summary by Barry Eads", "duration": 10951, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "10509", "name": "E.
