{"title": "Bible (YLT) NT 18: Epistle to Philemon", "description": "<i>Philemon</i> is a letter written by the Apostle Paul to the man of the same name, a leader in the church at Colossae, upon the return of his runaway slave, Onesimus. In it, Paul tells Philemon that Onesimus has become a Christian, mentions that he would like to have kept Onesimus with him as a helpful fellow-worker, and requests that Philemon treat him as a brother in the faith. It's a beautiful picture of how Christians are to treat those who have wronged us. - Summary by TriciaG", "duration": 206, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "159", "name": " Young's Literal Translation"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/philemon_ylt_2109_librivox/philemonylt_2109.jpg", "copyright_year": "1898", "genres": ["Young's Literal Translation"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "TriciaG"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "TriciaG"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "TriciaG"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Philemon", "readers": [3157], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/philemon_ylt_2109_librivox/philemon_01_ylt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 206}]}
