{"title": "In the Village of Viger", "description": "These ten superb short stories of Duncan Campbell Scott, published in 1896, portray humorous, farcical, and tragic aspects of life in the fictional Quebec village of Viger. Scott\u2019s tales of the lives and vicissitudes of Viger\u2019s inhabitants include an established milliner who is upset by the appearance of a younger, more popular rival; an innkeeper whose obsession with the Franco-Prussian War drives him mad; and a strange peddler with a carefully guarded secret that is accidentally revealed. \n<br><br>\nDuncan Campbell Scott was born in Ottawa, Ontario, in 1862. He entered the civil service in 1879 and remained until his retirement in 1932. Scott was an honored, skilled and popular poet, short-story writer, and essayist. He died in Ottawa in 1947. \n<br><br>\nFor more information see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duncan_Campbell_Scott.
