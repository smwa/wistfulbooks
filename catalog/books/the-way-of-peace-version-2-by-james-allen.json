{"title": "Way of Peace (version 2)", "description": "James Allen  (1864 - 1912) was a philosopher and a pioneer of New Thought movement.   His works have formed the basis of much of the curriculum used today by many motivational and self-help groups.<br />\nHis first book, which published in 1901, was From Poverty to Power, subtitled The Realization of Prosperity and Peace. Allen described this book as \"A Book for all those who are in search of better conditions, wider freedom, and increased usefulness.\"<br />\nOriginally, the book consisted of two separate volumes, The Path To Prosperity (sometimes rendered as The Path of Prosperity) and The Way of Peace.  Each volume was later published separately.  This recording is of the second volume.\n - Summary by Algy Pug", "duration": 7110, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "1323", "name": "James Allen"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/the_way_of_peace_version_2_1510_librivox/wayofpeace_1510.jpg", "copyright_year": "1910", "genres": ["*Non-fiction", "Self-Help", "Other religions"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Algy Pug"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Algy Pug"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "DaveC"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "The power of meditation", "readers": [4705], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_way_of_peace_version_2_1510_librivox/wayofpeace_1_allen_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1180}, {"section": 2, "title": "The two masters, self and truth", "readers": [4705], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_way_of_peace_version_2_1510_librivox/wayofpeace_2_allen_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1187}, {"section": 3, "title": "The acquirement of spiritual power", "readers": [4705], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_way_of_peace_version_2_1510_librivox/wayofpeace_3_allen_64kb.mp3", "duration": 705}, {"section": 4, "title": "The realization of selfless love", "readers": [4705], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_way_of_peace_version_2_1510_librivox/wayofpeace_4_allen_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1382}, {"section": 5, "title": "Entering into the infinite", "readers": [4705], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_way_of_peace_version_2_1510_librivox/wayofpeace_5_allen_64kb.mp3", "duration": 989}, {"section": 6, "title": "Saints, sages and saviors: the law of service", "readers": [4705], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_way_of_peace_version_2_1510_librivox/wayofpeace_6_allen_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1068}, {"section": 7, "title": "The realization of perfect peace", "readers": [4705], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/the_way_of_peace_version_2_1510_librivox/wayofpeace_7_allen_64kb.mp3", "duration": 599}]}
