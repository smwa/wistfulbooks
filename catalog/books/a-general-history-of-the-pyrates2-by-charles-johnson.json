{"title": "General History of the Pyrates (version 2)", "description": "A General History of the Robberies and Murders of the most notorious Pyrates is a 1724 book published in Britain containing biographies of contemporary pirates, which was influential in shaping popular conceptions of pirates. Its author uses the name Captain Charles Johnson, generally considered a pen name for one of London's writer-publishers. The prime source for the biographies of many well-known pirates, the book gives an almost mythical status to the more colourful characters, and it is likely that the author used considerable license in his accounts of pirate conversations. - Summary from Wikipedia", "duration": 42703, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "1394", "name": "Captain Charles Johnson"}], "coverArt":
