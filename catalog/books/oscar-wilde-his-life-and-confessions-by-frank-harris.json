{"title": "Oscar Wilde: His Life and Confessions", "description": "Consumers of biography are familiar with the division between memoirs of the living or recently dead written by those who \"knew\" the subject more or less intimately, and the more objective or scholarly accounts produced by later generations.<br /><br />\nIn the case of Wilde, as presented to us by Frank Harris, we are in a way doubly estranged from the subject. We meet with Oscar the charismatic talker, whose tone of voice can never be reproduced \u2013 even if a more scrupulous biographer had set down his words accurately \u2013 and we are perhaps already aware of him as Wilde the self-destructive celebrity who uneasily fills the place of the premier gay icon and martyr in our contemporary view.<br /><br />\nNeither of these images will do. We need to read as many accounts as possible. Harris, though himself a self-advertising literary and sexual buccaneer, takes a wincingly representative view of Wilde\u2019s homophile activity: for him it is a patrician excrescence, the abominable vice of the few, contracted at English boarding schools \u2013 though thankfully \u201cnot infectious\u201d as far as he himself is concerned.<br /><br />\nWhat a long road we have to travel to arrive at the essentially gay man of today! But there are many shortcuts to take us back to where we came from\u2026 (Summary by Martin Geeson)", "duration": 58303, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "5242", "name": " Frank Harris"}], "coverArt": "http://www.archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt4/Oscar_Wilde_His_Life_and_Confessions_1004.jpg", "copyright_year": "1916", "genres": ["*Non-fiction", "Biography & Autobiography"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Martin Geeson"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Martin Geeson"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "icyjumbo (1964-2010)"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Stav Nisser"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Author's Introduction", "readers": [3595], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/wilde_life_confessions_0907_librivox/oscarwilde_00_harris_64kb.mp3", "duration": 566}, {"section": 1, "title": "I.
