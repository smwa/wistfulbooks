{"title": "Little Busybodies: The Life of Crickets, Ants, Bees, and Others", "description": "These short stories about crickets, ants, bees, beetles and other little busybodies are intended by the two authors to show their children the wonderland of insectcs if we just take the time to look closely.  \"We hope that you will realize that more wonderful than the most wonderful fairy story ever told is the marvel of the created life of these little insects; we want you to come to know something of their joys and troubles; we want you to learn how to be kind to them, and how they may be useful to you; and we want you to find out for yourselves the places they take in the great plan of creation.\"  The authors speak to their own children in each story and through them to children of all ages to come.  A fun book  so jump right in!  Don't let the crickets have all the fun.     - Summary by The authors and phil chenevert", "duration": 12500, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "12409", "name": "Jeannette Augustus Marks"}, {"id": "12410", "name": "Julia Moody"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/littlebusybodies_1707_librivox/little_busybodies_1708.jpg", "copyright_year": "0", "genres": ["Science"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Linette Geisel"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "A Word to the Children and the Wise", "readers": [5796], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/littlebusybodies_1707_librivox/littlebusybodies_00_marks_64kb.mp3", "duration": 419}, {"section": 1, "title": "The Journey", "readers": [7510], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/littlebusybodies_1707_librivox/littlebusybodies_01_marks_64kb.mp3", "duration": 580}, {"section": 2, "title": "Rangeley Village", "readers": [11415], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/littlebusybodies_1707_librivox/littlebusybodies_02_marks_64kb.mp3", "duration": 611}, {"section": 3, "title": "The Little Army (Locusts and Grasshoppers)", "readers": [11415], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/littlebusybodies_1707_librivox/littlebusybodies_03_marks_64kb.mp3", "duration": 864}, {"section": 4, "title": "Fiddlers (Crickets)", "readers": [11415], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/littlebusybodies_1707_librivox/littlebusybodies_04_marks_64kb.mp3", "duration": 595}, {"section": 5, "title": "How Katy Did (Katydids)", "readers": [11415], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/littlebusybodies_1707_librivox/littlebusybodies_05_marks_64kb.mp3", "duration": 439}, {"section": 6, "title": "Fishing (Dragon-flies)", "readers": [7510], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/littlebusybodies_1707_librivox/littlebusybodies_06_marks_64kb.mp3", "duration": 704}, {"section": 7, "title": "The Swimming-Pool (The May-fly)", "readers": [7510], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/littlebusybodies_1707_librivox/littlebusybodies_07_marks_64kb.mp3", "duration": 360}, {"section": 8, "title": "The Rainy Day (Leaf and Tree Hoppers)", "readers": [11371], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/littlebusybodies_1707_librivox/littlebusybodies_08_marks_64kb.mp3", "duration": 581}, {"section": 9, "title": "The Prize (Lace-Wing, Ant-Lion, and Caddis-Worm)", "readers": [11425], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/littlebusybodies_1707_librivox/littlebusybodies_09_marks_64kb.mp3", "duration": 823}, {"section": 10, "title": "A Nagging Family (Flies and Mosquitoes)", "readers": [10568], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/littlebusybodies_1707_librivox/littlebusybodies_10_marks_64kb.mp3", "duration": 826}, {"section": 11, "title": "Camping Out (Butterflies and Moths)", "readers": [11371], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/littlebusybodies_1707_librivox/littlebusybodies_11_marks_64kb.mp3", "duration": 745}, {"section": 12, "title": "Camp-In-The-Clouds (Butterflies and Moths, continued)", "readers": [11371], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/littlebusybodies_1707_librivox/littlebusybodies_12_marks_64kb.mp3", "duration": 489}, {"section": 13, "title": "Storm-Bound (Beetles)", "readers": [8463], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/littlebusybodies_1707_librivox/littlebusybodies_13_marks_64kb.mp3", "duration": 890}, {"section": 14, "title": "A Day's Hunting (Bees)", "readers": [11415], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/littlebusybodies_1707_librivox/littlebusybodies_14_marks_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1260}, {"section": 15, "title": "Leaving Camp (Wasps)", "readers": [11237], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/littlebusybodies_1707_librivox/littlebusybodies_15_marks_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1083}, {"section": 16, "title": "Eyes And No Eyes (Ants)", "readers": [11237], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/littlebusybodies_1707_librivox/littlebusybodies_16_marks_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1231}]}
