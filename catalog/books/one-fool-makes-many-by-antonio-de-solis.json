{"title": "One Fool Makes Many", "description": "\"I will discuss this matter in an allegory: ... There was once upon a time a man, and he had a sister; and this said sister, she had a brother; and so this sister fell in love with another brother, and he had another sister; and one day what should she do, but take it into her head to run away with him? So then, after that, the brother, from whom the sister had been stolen, stole the sister of the thief. Now will you be pleased to tell us whether it would be best, in such a case, that each man should have his own again, or that each should keep what belonged to his neighbor?\"  - Summary by The Play\r\n<BR><BR>Cast list:<BR>\r\nDon Lewis: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/8011\">Greg Giordano</a><br>\r\nDon Diego: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/13577\">Adrian Stephens</a><br>\r\nDon Cosmo Mendieta: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/6754\">ToddHW</a><br>\r\nMartin, Don Lewis's Servant: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/14540\">Andrew Gaunce</a><br>\r\nJuancho, Don Cosmo's Servant: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/7170\">Alan Mapstone</a><br>\r\nDonna Anna, Sister of Don Diego: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/15380\">Annie Mars</a><br>\r\nDonna Isabella, Sister of Don Cosmo: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/13140\">Jenn Broda</a><br>\r\nJuana, Donna Anna's Maid: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/15373\">WendyKatzHiller</a><br>\r\nInes, Donna Isabella's Maid: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/10179\">Sonia</a><br>\r\nStage Directions: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/8425\">Larry Wilson</a><br>\r\nEditing: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/6754\">ToddHW</a><br>\r\n", "duration": 8935, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "15864", "name": "Antonio de Solis"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/onefoolmakesmany_2104_librivox/one_fool_makes_many_2104.jpg", "copyright_year": "1807", "genres": ["Comedy"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "ToddHW"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "ToddHW"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Sonia"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Act 1", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/onefoolmakesmany_2104_librivox/onefoolmakesmany_1_desolis_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3058}, {"section": 2, "title": "Act 2", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/onefoolmakesmany_2104_librivox/onefoolmakesmany_2_desolis_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2575}, {"section": 3, "title": "Act 3", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/onefoolmakesmany_2104_librivox/onefoolmakesmany_3_desolis_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3302}]}
