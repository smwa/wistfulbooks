{"title": "Hollow Tree and Deep Woods Book", "description": "\"In the House of Many Windows which stands in a large city and is sometimes called a \"flat\" by people who, because they are grown up, do not know any better, live the Little Lady and the Story Teller.\n\nThe Little Lady is four years old, going on five, and is fond of stories. This makes her and the Story Teller good friends. They mostly sit in the firelight after supper, and while the Little Lady is being undressed they tell each other all that has happened since morning. Then the Little Lady looks into the fire and says:\u2014\n\n\"Now, tell me a story.\"\n\nSometimes she wants a new story. Sometimes one of the old ones, which must be told always the same, because the Little Lady, like a good many grown up people, does not care for new and revised editions, but wants the old stories in the old words, that sound real and true. Sometimes the Story Teller forgets or improves on his plots, but the Little Lady never forgets and never fails to set the Story Teller right.\"  - Summary by the author", "duration": 14933, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "3233", "name": "Albert Bigelow Paine"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/hollowtreedeepwoodsbook_1710_librivox/hollow_tree_1710.jpg", "copyright_year": "1900", "genres": ["Myths", "Legends & Fairy Tales"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "DrPGould"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "The Little Lady & the Storyteller: The hollow Tree People", "readers": [11783], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/hollowtreedeepwoodsbook_1710_librivox/hollowtreeanddeepwoodsbook_01_paine_64kb.mp3", "duration": 599}, {"section": 2, "title": "A Joke All Around:", "readers": [10596], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/hollowtreedeepwoodsbook_1710_librivox/hollowtreeanddeepwoodsbook_02_paine_64kb.mp3", "duration": 378}, {"section": 3, "title": "Some New Acquaintances", "readers": [10596], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/hollowtreedeepwoodsbook_1710_librivox/hollowtreeanddeepwoodsbook_03_paine_64kb.mp3", "duration": 503}, {"section": 4, "title": "Mr. Rabbit's Big Dinner", "readers": [11783], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/hollowtreedeepwoodsbook_1710_librivox/hollowtreeanddeepwoodsbook_04_paine_64kb.mp3", "duration": 738}, {"section": 5, "title": "The Crow's Company", "readers": [11783], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/hollowtreedeepwoodsbook_1710_librivox/hollowtreeanddeepwoodsbook_05_paine_64kb.mp3", "duration": 478}, {"section": 6, "title": "The First Moon Story", "readers": [11772], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/hollowtreedeepwoodsbook_1710_librivox/hollowtreeanddeepwoodsbook_06_paine_64kb.mp3", "duration": 581}, {"section": 7, "title": "The Second Moon Story", "readers": [11772], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/hollowtreedeepwoodsbook_1710_librivox/hollowtreeanddeepwoodsbook_07_paine_64kb.mp3", "duration": 431}, {"section": 8, "title": "On the Edge of the World", "readers": [11772], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/hollowtreedeepwoodsbook_1710_librivox/hollowtreeanddeepwoodsbook_08_paine_64kb.mp3", "duration": 476}, {"section": 9, "title": "The First Pig Story", "readers": [11697], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/hollowtreedeepwoodsbook_1710_librivox/hollowtreeanddeepwoodsbook_09_paine_64kb.mp3", "duration": 318}, {"section": 10, "title": "The Second Pig Story", "readers": [11697], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/hollowtreedeepwoodsbook_1710_librivox/hollowtreeanddeepwoodsbook_10_paine_64kb.mp3", "duration": 401}, {"section": 11, "title": "Mr. Dog Takes Lessons in Dancing", "readers": [11697], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/hollowtreedeepwoodsbook_1710_librivox/hollowtreeanddeepwoodsbook_11_paine_64kb.mp3", "duration": 501}, {"section": 12, "title": "Mr Rabbit's Unwelcome Company", "readers": [11697], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/hollowtreedeepwoodsbook_1710_librivox/hollowtreeanddeepwoodsbook_12_paine_64kb.mp3", "duration": 626}, {"section": 13, "title": "How Mr. Dog Got Even, part 1", "readers": [11697], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/hollowtreedeepwoodsbook_1710_librivox/hollowtreeanddeepwoodsbook_13_paine_64kb.mp3", "duration": 477}, {"section": 14, "title": "How Mr. Dog Got Even, part 2", "readers": [11697], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/hollowtreedeepwoodsbook_1710_librivox/hollowtreeanddeepwoodsbook_14_paine_64kb.mp3", "duration": 638}, {"section": 15, "title": "The Little Lady's Vacation and Her Return", "readers": [11874], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/hollowtreedeepwoodsbook_1710_librivox/hollowtreeanddeepwoodsbook_15_paine_128.mp3_64kb.mp3", "duration": 132}, {"section": 16, "title": "The Story of the C.X.
