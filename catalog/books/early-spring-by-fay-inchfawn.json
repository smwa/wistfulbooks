{"title": "Early Spring", "description": "The Vernal Equinox signals the time when the winter\u2019s cold mantle begins to succumb to the warming influences of the oncoming spring. Fay Inchfawn (nee Elizabeth Rebecca Ward) took the springtime of 1920 as her inspiration for the bright promise of beauty and new life described in Early Spring. LibriVox volunteers bring you eight different readings of this magical work to celebrate the Vernal Equinox. This was the weekly poetry project for the week of March 19, 2006.\n(Summary by Chip)", "duration": 584, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "4159", "name": " Fay Inchfawn"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/early_spring_librivox/Early_Spring_1108.jpg", "copyright_year": "1880", "genres": ["Poetry", "Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Annie Coleman Rothenberg"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Annie Coleman Rothenberg"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Version 1", "readers": [30], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/early_spring_librivox/early_spring_inchfawn_apc_64kb.mp3", "duration": 78}, {"section": 2, "title": "Version 2", "readers": [36], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/early_spring_librivox/early_spring_inchfawn_chip_64kb.mp3", "duration": 75}, {"section": 3, "title": "Version 3", "readers": [461], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/early_spring_librivox/early_spring_inchfawn_cwb_64kb.mp3", "duration": 69}, {"section": 4, "title": "Version 4", "readers": [313], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/early_spring_librivox/early_spring_inchfawn_dj_64kb.mp3", "duration": 68}, {"section": 5, "title": "Version 5", "readers": [153], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/early_spring_librivox/early_spring_inchfawn_gw_64kb.mp3", "duration": 64}, {"section": 6, "title": "Version 6", "readers": [14], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/early_spring_librivox/early_spring_inchfawn_kll_64kb.mp3", "duration": 88}, {"section": 7, "title": "Version 7", "readers": [150], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/early_spring_librivox/early_spring_inchfawn_lf_64kb.mp3", "duration": 74}, {"section": 8, "title": "Version 8", "readers": [253], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/early_spring_librivox/early_spring_inchfawn_sjs_64kb.mp3", "duration": 67}]}
