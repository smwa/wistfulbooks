{"title": "Red House Mystery (Version 2)", "description": "Author A. A. Milne is best known to the world as the creator of Winnie-the-Pooh.  Yet Milne was versatile, having written dozens of plays, humorous articles, books and \u2013 The Red House Mystery.  In which\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark Ablett is the massively narcissistic owner of The Red House, a beautiful English country mansion. The estate is managed mostly by Mark\u2019s side-kick and younger cousin, Cayley.  As a wealthy artiste, Mark has chosen his handful of guests both to pander to his self-image and to allow him near-total control of virtually all aspects of his luxurious country house \u201cshow,\u201d as it were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the novel\u2019s first eight hours, Milne presents a literary tour-de-force:  first, the unexpected arrival (after 15 years\u2019 absence) of Robert, Mark\u2019s n'ere-do-well brother from Australia; second, Robert\u2019s murder; and third, Mark\u2019s own disappearance.  Enter Antony Gillingham, our brilliant but modest gentleman sleuth.  He arrives on a passing visit to his young friend Bill, one of Mark\u2019s house guests, who later becomes the faithful \u201cWatson\u201d to Antony\u2019s Holmes.  Follows the juxtaposition of three distinct theories of the crime  (or perhaps, given Mark\u2019s disappearance, crimes) as put forward by Antony, by Mark\u2019s confidant, Cayley, and by local police Inspector Birch.  It is of course Antony, with Bill\u2019s help, who solves this this delightful and extremely well-crafted mystery.  - Summary by Kirsten Wever", "duration": 25925, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "1259", "name": "A.
