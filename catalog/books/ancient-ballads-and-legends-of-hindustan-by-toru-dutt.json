{"title": "Ancient Ballads and Legends of Hindustan", "description": "Toru Dutt was an Indian poet, writing in English. Born in 1856, she travelled to England and France, and being a polyglot became fluent in French and English, later in Sanskrit as well. Her works gained popularity and success posthumously. This collection of her poems, Ancient Ballads and Legends of Hindustan, was published by her father after her death in 1877. This collection is divided into 2 parts: the 1st part contains long poems about the ancient legends of her native land of India, which had been passed on to her orally in Sanskrit and which held much fascination for her, and also implied her desire to return to India. The 2nd part is a collection of Dutt's miscellaneous poems, clearly influenced by her travels in Europe and includes the memorable 'Our Casuarina Tree'.
