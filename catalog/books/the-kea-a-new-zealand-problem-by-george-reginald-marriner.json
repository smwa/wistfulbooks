{"title": "KEA: a New Zealand problem Including a full description of this very interesting bird, its habitat and ways together with a discussion of the theories advanced to explain its sheep-killing propensities.", "description": "The kea (Nestor notabilis) is the world's only alpine parrot, and is endemic to the South Island of New Zealand. Although this large parrot is beloved of modern-day New Zealanders for its cheeky intelligence and mischievous behaviour (when someone else's tent is being shredded, or pack being raided), it has not always been so loved, and is currently classified as an endangered species. Its decline began in the 19th century, with the arrival of European settlers, their sheep, and the payment of rich rewards to bounty hunters for kea beaks. Written in 1907, The Kea: a New Zealand Problem summarises kea behaviour and the evidence from the 19th century that kea engaged in predatory behaviour towards sheep.
