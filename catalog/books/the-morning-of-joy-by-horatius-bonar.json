{"title": "Morning of Joy", "description": "I have been asked, once and again, to follow up \"<a href=\"https://librivox.org/the-night-of-weeping-by-horatius-bonar/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Night of Weeping </a>\" with \"The Morning of Joy,\" the words of David, in the 30th Psalm, having suggested the addition. After much thought and some hesitation I have done so. The former work was meant to be complete in itself, presenting not merely the night-side of tribulation, but bringing out also, though less prominently, some of its day-hues. As, however, it has been thought incomplete, having in it so much more of night than of clay; an endeavour has been made to complete it by drawing forward the eye to the scenes of morning, so soon to open upon us, in all their breadth and beauty. In this way we are led to forget the things that are behind, and to reach forward to those before, pressing towai-ds the mark for the prize of our high calling. And the fuller, the truer, the more frequent our anticipations of promised glory are, the deeper and the richer will our consolations be. - Summary by Preface", "duration": 12948, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "2999", "name": "Horatius Bonar"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/morningofjoy_2105_librivox/morningofjoy_2105.jpg", "copyright_year": "1856", "genres": ["Christianity - Other"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "InTheDesert"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "InTheDesert"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Kazbek"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Larry Wilson"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Preface", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/morningofjoy_2105_librivox/morningofjoy_00_bonar_64kb.mp3", "duration": 398}, {"section": 1, "title": "The Anticipations", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/morningofjoy_2105_librivox/morningofjoy_01_bonar_64kb.mp3", "duration": 557}, {"section": 2, "title": "The Night-Watch", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/morningofjoy_2105_librivox/morningofjoy_02_bonar_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1230}, {"section": 3, "title": "The  Earnests of the Morning", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/morningofjoy_2105_librivox/morningofjoy_03_bonar_64kb.mp3", "duration": 969}, {"section": 4, "title": "The Use of the Earnests", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/morningofjoy_2105_librivox/morningofjoy_04_bonar_64kb.mp3", "duration": 582}, {"section": 5, "title": "The Morning-Star", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/morningofjoy_2105_librivox/morningofjoy_05_bonar_64kb.mp3", "duration": 874}, {"section": 6, "title": "The Morning", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/morningofjoy_2105_librivox/morningofjoy_06_bonar_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1096}, {"section": 7, "title": "The Victory Over Death", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/morningofjoy_2105_librivox/morningofjoy_07_bonar_64kb.mp3", "duration": 807}, {"section": 8, "title": "The Reunion", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/morningofjoy_2105_librivox/morningofjoy_08_bonar_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1042}, {"section": 9, "title": "The Presence of the Lord", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/morningofjoy_2105_librivox/morningofjoy_09_bonar_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1340}, {"section": 10, "title": "The Kingdom", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/morningofjoy_2105_librivox/morningofjoy_10_bonar_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1186}, {"section": 11, "title": "The Grace", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/morningofjoy_2105_librivox/morningofjoy_11_bonar_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1059}, {"section": 12, "title": "The  Glory", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/morningofjoy_2105_librivox/morningofjoy_12_bonar_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1808}]}
