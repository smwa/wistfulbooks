{"title": "Short Nonfiction Collection, Vol. 060", "description": "Fifteen short nonfiction works in the public domain independently chosen by the readers. Volume 60 features excerpts from two German philosophers, Christian von Wolff and Hegel, as well as British theologian Edward Stillingfleet. It contains essays on women as inventors (Matilda Joslyn Gage) , Uruguayan society (W. H. Hudson), political economy (Frederick Bastiat) pipe smoking (Sewell Ford) and personal dislikes (Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.). Days to remember are chronicled in first hand accounts of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake (James Stetson), and a 1830's hydrogen balloon ascension over New York City (Charles Durant). Natural history is highlighted in accounts of Brazilian ants and monkeys (Henry Bates) and North American raccoons (N. M. Pairpoint). Last but not least, American journalist William Allen White writes a moving tribute to his 17-year old daughter Mary, who died after after being hit in the head by an overhanging tree limb while she was riding her horse.
