{"title": "Grand Ca\u00f1on of the Colorado", "description": "Nothing is ordinary in the world of John Muir, naturalist and author known as the Father of the US National Parks.  In this short work, written in the latter part of his life for Century Magazine, Muir beckons us to come with him, unrushed, to behold the wonder of the Grand Canyon.  Some of the beauty every life needs awaits here.  Its magnificence envelops, \"carrying us back into the midst of the life of a past infinitely remote.  And as we go on and on, studying this old, old life in the light of the life beating warmly about us, we enrich and lengthen our own.\" - Summary by Rebecca Eden Walker", "duration": 3693, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "486", "name": "John Muir"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/grandcanonofcolorado_2112_librivox/canyon_2112.jpg", "copyright_year": "0", "genres": ["Nature"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Rebecca Eden Walker"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Rebecca Eden Walker"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "J.
