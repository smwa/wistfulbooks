It is one of the most astonishing manifestations the world has ever witnessed. It came upon us like a phantom, swiftly; like a thief in the night, taking us by surprise. Yet the Prohibitionists will tell you that no one should be amazed, since for years\u2014for almost a century\u2014quiet forces have been at work to bring about this very thing.\" - Summary by Charles
