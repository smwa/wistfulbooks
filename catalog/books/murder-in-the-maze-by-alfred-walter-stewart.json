{"title": "Murder In The Maze", "description": "This is another story written by Walter Stewart under the pseudonym of J.J. Connington. His character of Sir Clinton Driffield, the chief constable, is challenged with solving crimes committed in the maze of the Shandon family estate. The Shandons are a successful if flawed set of brothers but all is not well beneath the surface of the privileged lives of their extended family. Jealousies and ambitions cause trouble as they often do. Sir Clinton and his faithful associate Wendover endeavour to unravel a mystery as complex as the maze itself. - Summary by Howard Skyman", "duration": 25987, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "18369", "name": "Alfred Walter Stewart"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/murderinthemaze_2408_librivox/murder_maze_2408.jpg", "copyright_year": "1927", "genres": ["Detective Fiction"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Howard Skyman"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Howard Skyman"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Barry Eads"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Winnifred Assmann"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "The Hackleton Case", "readers": [16541], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/murderinthemaze_2408_librivox/murderinthemaze_01_stewart_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1940}, {"section": 2, "title": "The Affair In The Maze", "readers": [16541], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/murderinthemaze_2408_librivox/murderinthemaze_02_stewart_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1721}, {"section": 3, "title": "The Immediate Results", "readers": [16541], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/murderinthemaze_2408_librivox/murderinthemaze_03_stewart_64kb.mp3", "duration": 993}, {"section": 4, "title": "The Chief Constable", "readers": [16541], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/murderinthemaze_2408_librivox/murderinthemaze_04_stewart_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1155}, {"section": 5, "title": "The Evidence In The Case", "readers": [16541], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/murderinthemaze_2408_librivox/murderinthemaze_05_stewart_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1670}, {"section": 6, "title": "The Toxicologist", "readers": [16541], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/murderinthemaze_2408_librivox/murderinthemaze_06_stewart_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1114}, {"section": 7, "title": "The Pot Of Curare", "readers": [16541], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/murderinthemaze_2408_librivox/murderinthemaze_07_stewart_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1172}, {"section": 8, "title": "The Dart", "readers": [16541], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/murderinthemaze_2408_librivox/murderinthemaze_08_stewart_64kb.mp3", "duration": 986}, {"section": 9, "title": "Opportunity, Method and Motive", "readers": [16541], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/murderinthemaze_2408_librivox/murderinthemaze_09_stewart_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1337}, {"section": 10, "title": "The Burglary At Whistlefield", "readers": [16541], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/murderinthemaze_2408_librivox/murderinthemaze_10_stewart_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1306}, {"section": 11, "title": "The Third Attack In The Maze", "readers": [16541], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/murderinthemaze_2408_librivox/murderinthemaze_11_stewart_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1930}, {"section": 12, "title": "The Squire's Theories", "readers": [16541], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/murderinthemaze_2408_librivox/murderinthemaze_12_stewart_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1761}, {"section": 13, "title": "The Fourth Attack", "readers": [16541], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/murderinthemaze_2408_librivox/murderinthemaze_13_stewart_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1556}, {"section": 14, "title": "The Forged Cheque", "readers": [16541], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/murderinthemaze_2408_librivox/murderinthemaze_14_stewart_64kb.mp3", "duration": 798}, {"section": 15, "title": "The Secretary's Affairs", "readers": [16541], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/murderinthemaze_2408_librivox/murderinthemaze_15_stewart_64kb.mp3", "duration": 893}, {"section": 16, "title": "The Last Attack In The Maze", "readers": [16541], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/murderinthemaze_2408_librivox/murderinthemaze_16_stewart_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1369}, {"section": 17, "title": "The Siege Of The Maze", "readers": [16541], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/murderinthemaze_2408_librivox/murderinthemaze_17_stewart_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1646}, {"section": 18, "title": "The Truth of the Matter", "readers": [16541], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/murderinthemaze_2408_librivox/murderinthemaze_18_stewart_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2640}]}
