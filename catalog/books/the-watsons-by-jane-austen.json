{"title": "Watsons", "description": "This fragment of a novel was written by Jane Austen in 1804 and remained untitled and unpublished until her nephew James Edward Austen-Leigh printed it in his <a href=\"http://librivox.org/memoir-of-jane-austen-by-james-austen-leigh/\">A Memoir of Jane Austen</a> in 1871. The title is from him.\n<br />\n<br />Mr Watson is a widowed clergyman with two sons and four daughters. The youngest daughter, Emma, has been brought up by a wealthy aunt and is consequently better educated and more refined than her sisters. But when her aunt contracts a foolish second marriage, Emma is obliged to return to her father's house. There she is chagrined by the crude and reckless husband-hunting of two of her twenty-something sisters.\n<br />(Summary from Gesine and Wikipedia)", "duration": 6506, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "155", "name": "Jane Austen"}], "coverArt": "http://www.archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt14/Watsons_1202.jpg", "copyright_year": "1871", "genres": ["General Fiction"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Gesine"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Gesine"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Gesine"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Leni"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Part 1", "readers": [20], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/watsons_0812_ge_librivox/watsons_01_austen_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1611}, {"section": 2, "title": "Part 2", "readers": [20], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/watsons_0812_ge_librivox/watsons_02_austen_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1397}, {"section": 3, "title": "Part 3", "readers": [20], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/watsons_0812_ge_librivox/watsons_03_austen_64kb.mp3", "duration": 942}, {"section": 4, "title": "Part 4", "readers": [20], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/watsons_0812_ge_librivox/watsons_04_austen_64kb.mp3", "duration": 528}, {"section": 5, "title": "Part 5", "readers": [20], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/watsons_0812_ge_librivox/watsons_05_austen_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1622}, {"section": 6, "title": "Part 6", "readers": [20], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/watsons_0812_ge_librivox/watsons_06_austen_64kb.mp3", "duration": 406}]}
