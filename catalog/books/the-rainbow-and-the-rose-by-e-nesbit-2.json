{"title": "Rainbow and the Rose (Version 2)", "description": "Although Edith Nesbit is best known for her innovative children's books and classic ghost stories, she was at heart a poet. She began writing poetry at the age of 14 and published over 20 volumes of poetry during her lifetime. Her poetry was praised by authors and poets such as Algernon Swinburne, Oscar Wilde, and literary critic, Andrew Lang. Although her timeless poetry is little read today, she still ranks at 323 of the top 500 poets.   - Summary by AnnaLisa", "duration": 7936, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "24", "name": "E.
