{"title": "English as She is Spoke", "description": "<i>English as She is Spoke</i> is a 19th century Portuguese-to-English phrasebook that has become a classic of absurdist humor, owing chiefly to the apparent fact that its writer had absolutely no knowledge of English. It is thought that for utterly obscure reasons its unknown author, Pedro Carolino, used a dictionary to translate Portuguese words to French, then a second dictionary to convert French to English, producing an incoherent but hilarious result. Mark Twain said of this book, \"Nobody can add to the absurdity of this book, nobody can imitate it successfully, nobody can hope to produce its fellow; it is perfect.\" - Summary by J A Carter", "duration": 3809, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "12797", "name": "Pedro Carolino"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/english_as_she_is_spoke_1905_librivox/englishassheisspoke_1905.jpg", "copyright_year": "1883", "genres": ["Humor", "Writing & Linguistics"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Elsie Selwyn"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "TriciaG"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Piotr Nater"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Introduction and Preface", "readers": [984], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/english_as_she_is_spoke_1905_librivox/englishassheisspoke_00_carolino_64kb.mp3", "duration": 933}, {"section": 1, "title": "Vocabulary and Familiar Phrases", "readers": [984], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/english_as_she_is_spoke_1905_librivox/englishassheisspoke_01_carolino_64kb.mp3", "duration": 845}, {"section": 2, "title": "Familiar Dialogues", "readers": [13257], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/english_as_she_is_spoke_1905_librivox/englishassheisspoke_02_carolino_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1283}, {"section": 3, "title": "Familiar Letters, Anecdotes, Idiotisms, and Proverbs", "readers": [13257], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/english_as_she_is_spoke_1905_librivox/englishassheisspoke_03_carolino_64kb.mp3", "duration": 748}]}
