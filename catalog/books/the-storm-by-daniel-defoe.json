{"title": "Storm", "description": "<i>The Storm</i> (1704) holds a special place in the writings of Daniel Defoe.  Widely considered a founding document of modern journalism, <i>The Storm</i> narrates the calamitous events of November 1703 that are framed by the author in the first four chapters.  These are followed by verbatim eyewitness accounts, solicited from survivors through a newspaper advertisement that Defoe placed shortly after the hurricane struck.  Defoe is primarily known for his later fiction, loosely based on historical calamities, such as his <i>Journal of the Plague Year</i> (1722), and by fictionalized novels purporting to be first-person accounts, including <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> (1719) and <i>Moll Flanders </i>(1722).  It can be argued that <i>The Storm</i> was the journalistic crucible in which the master realist Defoe forged his later novelistic artistry, with its penchant for \"the telling detail.\"  In fact, his fiction novel <i>The Plague Year</i> remains a required reading for journalism students to this day, side-by-side with the non-fiction account of  <i>The Storm</i>. \u2013Denny Sayers", "duration": 32938, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "895", "name": "Daniel Defoe"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt17/storm_1504.jpg", "copyright_year": "1704", "genres": ["Early Modern"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Denny Sayers (d. 2015)"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Denny Sayers (d. 2015)"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Crln Yldz Ksr"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "MaxineMarie"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Preface", "readers": [26], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/the_storm_1504_librivox/storm_00_defoe_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1258}, {"section": 1, "title": "Chapter 1", "readers": [26], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/the_storm_1504_librivox/storm_01_defoe_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1478}, {"section": 2, "title": "Chapter 2", "readers": [26], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/the_storm_1504_librivox/storm_02_defoe_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1337}, {"section": 3, "title": "Chapter 3", "readers": [26], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/the_storm_1504_librivox/storm_03_defoe_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2622}, {"section": 4, "title": "Ch. 4 - Of the Extent of this Storm", "readers": [26], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/the_storm_1504_librivox/storm_04_defoe_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1641}, {"section": 5, "title": "Ch. 4 - 'Tis very observable", "readers": [26], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/the_storm_1504_librivox/storm_05_defoe_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1184}, {"section": 6, "title": "Of the Effects of the Storm, Damages in the City of London", "readers": [26], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/the_storm_1504_librivox/storm_06_defoe_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1592}, {"section": 7, "title": "Of the Effects of the Storm, Damages in the Country", "readers": [26], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/the_storm_1504_librivox/storm_07_defoe_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2126}, {"section": 8, "title": "The following Letters, tho' in a homely stile", "readers": [26], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/the_storm_1504_librivox/storm_08_defoe_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2082}, {"section": 9, "title": "From Littleton in Worcestershire", "readers": [26], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/the_storm_1504_librivox/storm_09_defoe_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1603}, {"section": 10, "title": "At Brenchly in the Western Parts of Kent", "readers": [26], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/the_storm_1504_librivox/storm_10_defoe_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1723}, {"section": 11, "title": "It has been impossible to give an exact relation", "readers": [26], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/the_storm_1504_librivox/storm_11_defoe_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1659}, {"section": 12, "title": "Of the Damages on the Water", "readers": [26], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/the_storm_1504_librivox/storm_12_defoe_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2043}, {"section": 13, "title": "From Newport and Hastings the following Accounts", "readers": [26], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/the_storm_1504_librivox/storm_13_defoe_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2144}, {"section": 14, "title": "Nor can the Damage suffered in the River of Thames be forgot", "readers": [26], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/the_storm_1504_librivox/storm_14_defoe_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2218}, {"section": 15, "title": "Of the Damage to the Navy & Of the Earthquake", "readers": [26], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/the_storm_1504_librivox/storm_15_defoe_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1639}, {"section": 16, "title": "Of remarkable Deliverances", "readers": [26], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/the_storm_1504_librivox/storm_16_defoe_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1799}, {"section": 17, "title": "Another great Preservation", "readers": [26], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/the_storm_1504_librivox/storm_17_defoe_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1059}, {"section": 18, "title": "The two following Letters & The Conclusion", "readers": [26], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/the_storm_1504_librivox/storm_18_defoe_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1731}]}
