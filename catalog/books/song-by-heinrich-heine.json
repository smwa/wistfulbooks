{"title": "Song", "description": "Christian Johann Heinrich Heine was a German poet, journalist, essayist, and literary critic. He is best known outside Germany for his early lyric poetry, which was set to music in the form of Lieder (art songs) by composers such as Robert Schumann and Franz Schubert. Heine's later verse and prose are distinguished by their satirical wit and irony. He is considered part of the Young Germany movement. His radical political views led to many of his works being banned by German authorities. Heine spent the last 25 years of his life as an expatriate in Paris. - Summary by Wikipedia", "duration": 989, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "69", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/song_1707.poem_librivox/song_1707.jpg", "copyright_year": "1881", "genres": ["Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Song - Read by APL-EL", "readers": [4705, 9872], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/song_1707.poem_librivox/song_heine_alp_el_64kb.mp3", "duration": 132}, {"section": 2, "title": "Song - Read by BK", "readers": [8786], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/song_1707.poem_librivox/song_heine_bk_64kb.mp3", "duration": 166}, {"section": 3, "title": "Song - Read by DL", "readers": [2911], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/song_1707.poem_librivox/song_heine_dl_64kb.mp3", "duration": 126}, {"section": 4, "title": "Song - Read by IK", "readers": [7785], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/song_1707.poem_librivox/song_heine_ik_64kb.mp3", "duration": 139}, {"section": 5, "title": "Song - Read by LLW", "readers": [4738], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/song_1707.poem_librivox/song_heine_llw_64kb.mp3", "duration": 137}, {"section": 6, "title": "Song - Read by TP", "readers": [10789], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/song_1707.poem_librivox/song_heine_tp_64kb.mp3", "duration": 150}, {"section": 7, "title": "Song - Read by VB", "readers": [8169], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/song_1707.poem_librivox/song_heine_vb_64kb.mp3", "duration": 139}]}
