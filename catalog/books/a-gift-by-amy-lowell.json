{"title": "Gift", "description": "Amy Lawrence Lowell was an American poet of the imagist school from Brookline, Massachusetts, who posthumously won the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1926.<br>  Though she sometimes wrote sonnets, Lowell was an early adherent to the \"free verse\" method of poetry and one of the major champions of this method. She defined it in her preface to \"Sword Blades and Poppy Seed\"; in the North American Review for January, 1917; in the closing chapter of \"Tendencies in Modern American Poetry\"; and also in the Dial (January 17, 1918), as: \"The definition of Vers libre is: a verse-formal based upon cadence. To understand vers libre, one must abandon all desire to find in it the even rhythm of metrical feet. One must allow the lines to flow as they will when read aloud by an intelligent reader. Or, to put it another way, unrhymed cadence is \"built upon 'organic rhythm,' or the rhythm of the speaking voice with its necessity for breathing, rather than upon a strict metrical system. Free verse within its own law of cadence has no absolute rules; it would not be 'free' if it had.\"  - Summary by Wikipedia", "duration": 819, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "1345", "name": "Amy Lowell"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/a_gift_1602.poem_librivox/gift_amy_lowell_1602.jpg", "copyright_year": "1914", "genres": ["Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "A Gift - Read by ALP", "readers": [4705], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/a_gift_1602.poem_librivox/gift_lowell_alp_64kb.mp3", "duration": 48}, {"section": 2, "title": "A Gift - Read by ATR", "readers": [10612], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/a_gift_1602.poem_librivox/gift_lowell_atr_64kb.mp3", "duration": 44}, {"section": 3, "title": "A Gift - Read by BK", "readers": [8786], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/a_gift_1602.poem_librivox/gift_lowell_bk_64kb.mp3", "duration": 55}, {"section": 4, "title": "A Gift - Read by BLT", "readers": [6281], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/a_gift_1602.poem_librivox/gift_lowell_blt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 48}, {"section": 5, "title": "A Gift - Read by BSD", "readers": [10402], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/a_gift_1602.poem_librivox/gift_lowell_bsd_64kb.mp3", "duration": 50}, {"section": 6, "title": "A Gift - Read by DII", "readers": [4009], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/a_gift_1602.poem_librivox/gift_lowell_dii_64kb.mp3", "duration": 45}, {"section": 7, "title": "A Gift - Read by DK", "readers": [10631], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/a_gift_1602.poem_librivox/gift_lowell_dk_64kb.mp3", "duration": 53}, {"section": 8, "title": "A Gift - Read by DL", "readers": [2911], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/a_gift_1602.poem_librivox/gift_lowell_dl_64kb.mp3", "duration": 49}, {"section": 9, "title": "A Gift - Read by EL", "readers": [9872], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/a_gift_1602.poem_librivox/gift_lowell_el_64kb.mp3", "duration": 55}, {"section": 10, "title": "A Gift - Read by GG", "readers": [8011], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/a_gift_1602.poem_librivox/gift_lowell_gg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 60}, {"section": 11, "title": "A Gift - Read by JEF", "readers": [10494], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/a_gift_1602.poem_librivox/gift_lowell_jef_64kb.mp3", "duration": 52}, {"section": 12, "title": "A Gift - Read by JJW", "readers": [7876], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/a_gift_1602.poem_librivox/gift_lowell_jjw_64kb.mp3", "duration": 37}, {"section": 13, "title": "A Gift - Read by LAH", "readers": [1212], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/a_gift_1602.poem_librivox/gift_lowell_lah_64kb.mp3", "duration": 52}, {"section": 14, "title": "A Gift - Read by LLW", "readers": [4738], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/a_gift_1602.poem_librivox/gift_lowell_llw_64kb.mp3", "duration": 63}, {"section": 15, "title": "A Gift - Read by MK", "readers": [8051], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/a_gift_1602.poem_librivox/gift_lowell_mk_64kb.mp3", "duration": 58}, {"section": 16, "title": "A Gift - Read by MP", "readers": [10463], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/a_gift_1602.poem_librivox/gift_lowell_mp_64kb.mp3", "duration": 50}]}
