{"title": "Soren Kierkegaard, Various Readings", "description": "The writings listed here represent books about Soren Kierkegaard. A fragment of his work, On the Dedication to \"That Single Individual\", has made it to the public domain. Who was Soren Kierkegaard? He was a Danish philosopher and religious author; b. Copenhagen May 6, 1813; d. there Nov. 11, 1855. His father, Michael, a clothing merchant, once cursed God when he was young. This one incident caused him so much distress that it affected him with a deep melancholy, which he transferred to poor Soren. Michael was an evil man. He tricked Soren into thinking that the whole world existed in his own living room by taking him for imaginary walks about the neighborhood, or anywhere Soren wanted to go, as long as it existed in his imagination only. Later in life, when Soren was on his own, he rarely left Copenhagen, but he did walk about the streets and greet passersby, discussing events of the day. After 6 years of \u201csplendid inactivity\u201d he obtained his degree in Theology from the University of Copenhagen with the submission of his thesis paper in 1841, On the Concept of Irony with Continual Reference to Socrates. Just before graduation he fell in love with Regine Olsen and proposed that they marry. She accepted, but Soren was unable to live up to the requirements of marriage and broke off the engagement after a short period. He lived a life of despair afterward. His father, Regine, and Socrates were the major influences in his life. So say all the authors in the following readings, but I disagree.<br/><br/>\n\nSoren considered a variety of callings, he could be philosopher, a scientist, or a preacher, but he ultimately decided that Christianity was his interest. He wondered if J. P. Mynster, bishop of Zealand and head of the National Church of Denmark, was preaching true Christianity or not. He decided at this point that his \u201ctask is a Socratic task, to revise the conception of what it means to be a Christian\u201d. He was interested only in the \u201cHow\u201d of Christianity, not the \u201cWhat\u201d of Christianity. He became an author, an author who was always \u201cin the process of becoming\u201d what he would be. He became many authors, Victor Eremita, Johannes de Silentio, Johannes Climacus, Vigilius Haufniensis, Nicolaus Notabene, Hilarius Bookbinder, Frater Taciturnus, and Soren Kierkegaard. All of them wrote books between the years 1843 and 1855. He used his imagination to create each author as an existing individual Human being, one who exists, \u201cbetween the esthetic and the ethical\u201d where \u201cthe esthetic is existing; the ethicist is struggling against the religious\u201d, as one \u201caware of the religious-and the leap\u201d of faith, one \u201cwho ordinarily despairs of nothing, despairs of repetition\u201d, one who has \u201cused a love affair in relation to what it means to exist\u201d, one who believed \u201cthat in relation to God we are always in the wrong,\u201d one who cries to God \u201cI cannot understand you, but I will love you\u201d one who as \"the ethicist, in despair, has chosen himself out of terror of having himself\" and finally as one who said \u201cthat truth is objectively a paradox shows precisely that subjectivity is truth\u201d so \u201cOnly truth that builds up is truth for you\u201d.<br/><br/>\n\nThe authors are all in agreement that Soren's father, Regine, and Socrates were influential in his life. None of them were able to state that Jesus Christ had any influence upon him at all. Soren Kierkegaard said, \"God is not like a king in a predicament, who says to the highly trusted Minister of the Interior, \u201cYou must do everything, you must create the atmosphere for our proposal and win public opinion to our side.\u201d \"But in relation to God, there are no secret instruction for a human being any more than there are any backstairs. Even the most eminent genius who comes to give a report had best come in fear and trembling, for God is not hard pressed for geniuses. He can create a few legion of them if needed.\" God wants each individual to examine to judge and to decide. http://www.archive.org/details/forselfexaminati011847mbp <br/><br/>\n\nHere is a link to to some of his works http://www.religion-online.org/listbycategory.asp?Cat=110 one to a biography http://www.stolaf.edu/collections/kierkegaard/aboutkierk.html - and a link to Kierkegaard reorganized (systemetized?) - http://www.plough.com/ebooks/Provocations.html - (Summary by Soupy)", "duration": 16056, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "18", "name": " Various"}], "coverArt": "https://www.archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt7/soren_kierkegaard_various_readings_1012.jpg", "copyright_year": "0", "genres": ["Religion", "Modern"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Craig Campbell"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Craig Campbell"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Leni"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Linda Andrus"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Kierkegaard, Kyer'ke-Gord, Soren Aaby", "readers": [3374], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/kierkegaard_readings_cc_librivox/kierkegaardreadings_01_various_64kb.mp3", "duration": 719}, {"section": 2, "title": "Imitation of Christ and Justifying Faith", "readers": [3374], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/kierkegaard_readings_cc_librivox/kierkegaardreadings_02_various_64kb.mp3", "duration": 649}, {"section": 3, "title": "Kierkegaard, Kyer'ke-Gord, Soren Aaby", "readers": [3374], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/kierkegaard_readings_cc_librivox/kierkegaardreadings_03_various_64kb.mp3", "duration": 400}, {"section": 4, "title": "Niels Treschow", "readers": [3374], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/kierkegaard_readings_cc_librivox/kierkegaardreadings_04_various_64kb.mp3", "duration": 920}, {"section": 5, "title": "Hans Lassen Martensen", "readers": [3374], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/kierkegaard_readings_cc_librivox/kierkegaardreadings_05_various_64kb.mp3", "duration": 462}, {"section": 6, "title": "Hegel v Kierkegaard", "readers": [3374], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/kierkegaard_readings_cc_librivox/kierkegaardreadings_06_various_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1545}, {"section": 7, "title": "Punitive Righteouness", "readers": [3374], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/kierkegaard_readings_cc_librivox/kierkegaardreadings_07_various_64kb.mp3", "duration": 416}, {"section": 8, "title": "Biographical", "readers": [3374], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/kierkegaard_readings_cc_librivox/kierkegaardreadings_08_various_64kb.mp3", "duration": 659}, {"section": 9, "title": "On the Dedication to \"That Single Individual\"", "readers": [3374], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/kierkegaard_readings_cc_librivox/kierkegaardreadings_09_various_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1329}, {"section": 10, "title": "Father and Son", "readers": [3374], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/kierkegaard_readings_cc_librivox/kierkegaardreadings_10_various_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1434}, {"section": 11, "title": "Regine and Socrates", "readers": [3374], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/kierkegaard_readings_cc_librivox/kierkegaardreadings_11_various_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1386}, {"section": 12, "title": "Either-Or", "readers": [3374], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/kierkegaard_readings_cc_librivox/kierkegaardreadings_12_various_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1050}, {"section": 13, "title": "Fear and Trembling etc.", "readers": [3374], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/kierkegaard_readings_cc_librivox/kierkegaardreadings_13_various_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1301}, {"section": 14, "title": "Corsair and Works of Love", "readers": [3374], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/kierkegaard_readings_cc_librivox/kierkegaardreadings_14_various_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1913}, {"section": 15, "title": "The Moment", "readers": [3374], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/kierkegaard_readings_cc_librivox/kierkegaardreadings_15_various_64kb.mp3", "duration": 986}, {"section": 16, "title": "The Anti-rational View of Christianity", "readers": [3374], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/kierkegaard_readings_cc_librivox/kierkegaardreadings_16_various_64kb.mp3", "duration": 702}, {"section": 17, "title": "A Great Danish Thinker", "readers": [3374], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/kierkegaard_readings_cc_librivox/kierkegaardreadings_17_various_64kb.mp3", "duration": 185}]}
