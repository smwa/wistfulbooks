{"title": "Electra (Storr Translation)", "description": "Electra or Elektra is a Greek tragedy by Sophocles. Its date is not known, but various stylistic similarities with the Philoctetes (409 BC) and the Oedipus at Colonus (401 BC) lead scholars to suppose that it was written towards the end of Sophocles' career.  Set in the city of Argos a few years after the Trojan war, it recounts the tale of Electra and the vengeance that she and her brother Orestes take on their mother Clytemnestra and step father Aegisthus for the murder of their father, Agamemnon. - Summary by Wikipedia", "duration": 5337, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "1157", "name": " Sophocles"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/electra_1506_librivox/electra2_1506.jpg", "copyright_year": "1916", "genres": ["Classics (Greek & Latin Antiquity)", "Tragedy"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Expatriate"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Expatriate"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Annise"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "DaveC"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Part I", "readers": [8713], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/electra_1506_librivox/electra_01_sophocles_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1842}, {"section": 2, "title": "Part II", "readers": [8713], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/electra_1506_librivox/electra_02_sophocles_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1850}, {"section": 3, "title": "Part III", "readers": [8713], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/electra_1506_librivox/electra_03_sophocles_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1645}]}
