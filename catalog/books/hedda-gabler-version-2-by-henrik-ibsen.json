{"title": "Hedda Gabler (version 2)", "description": "Hedda Gabler has just returned from her honeymoon. She has married out of ennui, and is already heartily sick of her husband, who is a plodding, pedantic academic. Upon moving into her new Christiania home, she soon discovers that Thea Elvsted, an old schoolmate whom she always envied and despised, has boldly left her marriage in order to be with Eilert L\u00f6vborg, a former lover of Hedda who is trying to overcome a past life of debauchery and alcoholism by creating a revolutionary new work of philosophy and returning to respectability. Another old flame, Judge Brack, tries to wheedle his way back into Hedda\u2019s life by any means possible. Yearning to exercise power over someone, anyone, to \u201cmould a human destiny,\u201d Hedda begins callously to manipulate the people around her to devastating effect. Written at the height of Ibsen\u2019s mature period, this play has endured as one of the most-performed and most powerful of all Ibsen\u2019s works. Hedda is both perpetrator and victim, a psychologically-complex, frustrated woman trying to assert some control over her world.\n( Expatriate)", "duration": 12444, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "477", "name": "Henrik Ibsen"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/hedda_gabler_2_1603_librivox/hedda_gabler_1603.jpg", "copyright_year": "1907", "genres": ["Tragedy"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Expatriate"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Expatriate"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Annise"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "DaveC"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Translator's Introduction", "readers": [8713], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/hedda_gabler_2_1603_librivox/heddagabler_00_ibsen_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1424}, {"section": 1, "title": "Act I", "readers": [8713], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/hedda_gabler_2_1603_librivox/heddagabler_01_ibsen_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3716}, {"section": 2, "title": "Act II", "readers": [8713], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/hedda_gabler_2_1603_librivox/heddagabler_02_ibsen_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3219}, {"section": 3, "title": "Act III", "readers": [8713], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/hedda_gabler_2_1603_librivox/heddagabler_03_ibsen_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2131}, {"section": 4, "title": "Act IV", "readers": [8713], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/hedda_gabler_2_1603_librivox/heddagabler_04_ibsen_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1954}]}
