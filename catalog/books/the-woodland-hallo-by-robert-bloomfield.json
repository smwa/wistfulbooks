One of his early duties, when he was sent to London to work as a shoemaker, was to read the papers aloud while the others in the workshop were working, and he became particularly interested in the poetry section of The London Magazine. - Summary by Wikipedia", "duration": 2074, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "15578", "name": "Robert Bloomfield"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/woodland_hallo_2103.poem_librivox/woodlandhallo_2103.jpg", "copyright_year": "1806", "genres": ["Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "David Lawrence"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "The Woodland Hall\u00f3 - Read by AT", "readers": [15994], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/woodland_hallo_2103.poem_librivox/hallo_bloomfield_at_64kb.mp3", "duration": 110}, {"section": 2, "title": "The Woodland Hall\u00f3 - Read by BK", "readers": [8786], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/woodland_hallo_2103.poem_librivox/hallo_bloomfield_bk_64kb.mp3", "duration": 116}, {"section": 3, "title": "The Woodland Hall\u00f3 - Read by CB", "readers": [9862], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/woodland_hallo_2103.poem_librivox/hallo_bloomfield_cb_64kb.mp3", "duration": 88}, {"section": 4, "title": "The Woodland Hall\u00f3 - Read by CH", "readers": [16004], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/woodland_hallo_2103.poem_librivox/hallo_bloomfield_ch_64kb.mp3", "duration": 92}, {"section": 5, "title": "The Woodland Hall\u00f3 - Read by CJPH", "readers": [12752], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/woodland_hallo_2103.poem_librivox/hallo_bloomfield_cjph_64kb.mp3", "duration": 106}, {"section": 6, "title": "The Woodland Hall\u00f3 - Read by DL", "readers": [2911], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/woodland_hallo_2103.poem_librivox/hallo_bloomfield_dl_64kb.mp3", "duration": 105}, {"section": 7, "title": "The Woodland Hall\u00f3 - Sung by EZWA", "readers": [123], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/woodland_hallo_2103.poem_librivox/hallo_bloomfield_ezwa_64kb.mp3", "duration": 158}, {"section": 8, "title": "The Woodland Hall\u00f3 - Read by GG", "readers": [8011], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/woodland_hallo_2103.poem_librivox/hallo_bloomfield_gg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 118}, {"section": 9, "title": "The Woodland Hall\u00f3 - Read by GRS", "readers": [12484], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/woodland_hallo_2103.poem_librivox/hallo_bloomfield_grs_64kb.mp3", "duration": 106}, {"section": 10, "title": "The Woodland Hall\u00f3 - Read by HR", "readers": [16005], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/woodland_hallo_2103.poem_librivox/hallo_bloomfield_hr_64kb.mp3", "duration": 80}, {"section": 11, "title": "The Woodland Hall\u00f3 - Read by KE", "readers": [16003], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/woodland_hallo_2103.poem_librivox/hallo_bloomfield_ke_64kb.mp3", "duration": 104}, {"section": 12, "title": "The Woodland Hall\u00f3 - Read by KS", "readers": [13278], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/woodland_hallo_2103.poem_librivox/hallo_bloomfield_ks_64kb.mp3", "duration": 93}, {"section": 13, "title": "The Woodland Hall\u00f3 - Read by LAH", "readers": [1212], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/woodland_hallo_2103.poem_librivox/hallo_bloomfield_lah_64kb.mp3", "duration": 111}, {"section": 14, "title": "The Woodland Hall\u00f3 - Read by LCW", "readers": [8425], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/woodland_hallo_2103.poem_librivox/hallo_bloomfield_lcw_64kb.mp3", "duration": 98}, {"section": 15, "title": "The Woodland Hall\u00f3 - Read by PS", "readers": [8576], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/woodland_hallo_2103.poem_librivox/hallo_bloomfield_ps_64kb.mp3", "duration": 104}, {"section": 16, "title": "The Woodland Hall\u00f3 - Read by RF", "readers": [14495], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/woodland_hallo_2103.poem_librivox/hallo_bloomfield_rf_64kb.mp3", "duration": 97}, {"section": 17, "title": "The Woodland Hall\u00f3 - Read by SBW", "readers": [14580], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/woodland_hallo_2103.poem_librivox/hallo_bloomfield_sbw_64kb.mp3", "duration": 72}, {"section": 18, "title": "The Woodland Hall\u00f3 - Read by SLG", "readers": [15673], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/woodland_hallo_2103.poem_librivox/hallo_bloomfield_slg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 104}, {"section": 19, "title": "The Woodland Hall\u00f3 - Read by TRL", "readers": [15829], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/woodland_hallo_2103.poem_librivox/hallo_bloomfield_trl_64kb.mp3", "duration": 105}, {"section": 20, "title": "The Woodland Hall\u00f3 - Read by WC", "readers": [12980], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/woodland_hallo_2103.poem_librivox/hallo_bloomfield_wc_64kb.mp3", "duration": 107}]}
