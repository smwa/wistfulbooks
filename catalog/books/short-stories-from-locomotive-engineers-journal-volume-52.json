{"title": "Short Stories from Locomotive Engineers Journal, Volume 52", "description": "These short stories are taken from the Locomotive Engineers Journal, Volume 52 which covers the year, 1918. Don't expect any trains -- these are short works on many subjects, including romance, adventure, humor, etc. -- of 5 to 15 minutes in length, by minor pulp fiction writers of the day, including Agnes Brogan, Pauline Richards, Warren Miller, Clarissa Mackie, and Xeno Putnam. Putnam wrote a couple of non-fiction works on farm equipment; Mackie was a prolific writer whose work appeared in several magazines and newspapers. I have created an e-book version of this set for easier viewing and placed it on Archive's Community Texts <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/ShortStoriesFromLocomotiveEngineer1918\">here </a>.
