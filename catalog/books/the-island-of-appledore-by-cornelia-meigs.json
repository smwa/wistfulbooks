{"title": "Island of Appledore", "description": "Any one who knows the coast of New England will know also the Island of Appledore and just where it lies. Such a person can tell you that it is not exactly the place described in this book, that it is small and bare and rocky with no woods, no meadows, no church, or mill, or mill-creek road. Perhaps all that the story tells of it that is true is that there the rocks give forth their strange deep song, \u201cthe calling of Appledore,\u201d as warning of a storm, that there the poppies bloom as nowhere else in the world, that there the surf comes rolling in, day in and day out, the whole year through, and that there one\u2019s memory turns back with longing, no matter how many years of absence have gone by.\r\n\r\nThere, also, you can sit for hours to watch the huge, green breakers come foaming and tumbling in endless procession up the stony beach; you can watch the nimble sandpipers and the tireless, wheeling gulls; and if you choose you can spin for yourself just such a story as this one of Billy Wentworth and Captain Saulsby and Sally Shute, a tale of mysteries and perils and midnight adventures on the shores of Appledore. - Summary by the author's foreward", "duration": 17307, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "2587", "name": "Cornelia Meigs"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/island_appledore_2206_librivox/island_appeldore_2206.jpg", "copyright_year": "1917", "genres": ["Action & Adventure Fiction", "Nautical & Marine Fiction", "Published 1900 onward"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Roger Melin"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Roger Melin"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Annise"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Moukthika"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Peering Eyes", "readers": [2156], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/island_appledore_2206_librivox/islandofappledore_01_aldon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1674}, {"section": 2, "title": "The Mill-Creek Road", "readers": [2156], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/island_appledore_2206_librivox/islandofappledore_02_aldon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1549}, {"section": 3, "title": "The Cruise of the Josephine", "readers": [2156], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/island_appledore_2206_librivox/islandofappledore_03_aldon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1876}, {"section": 4, "title": "Captain Saulsby's Watch", "readers": [2156], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/island_appledore_2206_librivox/islandofappledore_04_aldon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1152}, {"section": 5, "title": "The War Game", "readers": [2156], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/island_appledore_2206_librivox/islandofappledore_05_aldon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1226}, {"section": 6, "title": "The Ebbing of the Tide", "readers": [2156], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/island_appledore_2206_librivox/islandofappledore_06_aldon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1195}, {"section": 7, "title": "Mist and Moonlight", "readers": [2156], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/island_appledore_2206_librivox/islandofappledore_07_aldon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1439}, {"section": 8, "title": "The Stranger at the Mill", "readers": [2156], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/island_appledore_2206_librivox/islandofappledore_08_aldon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1120}, {"section": 9, "title": "The Calling of the Island", "readers": [2156], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/island_appledore_2206_librivox/islandofappledore_09_aldon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1421}, {"section": 10, "title": "Three Quarters of a Year", "readers": [2156], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/island_appledore_2206_librivox/islandofappledore_10_aldon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1299}, {"section": 11, "title": "The Watchfires of Appledore", "readers": [2156], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/island_appledore_2206_librivox/islandofappledore_11_aldon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1649}, {"section": 12, "title": "The Last Voyage of Johann Happs", "readers": [2156], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/island_appledore_2206_librivox/islandofappledore_12_aldon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1707}]}
