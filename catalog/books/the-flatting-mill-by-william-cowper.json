{"title": "Flatting-Mill", "description": "LibriVox volunteers bring you 14 recordings of The Flatting-Mill by William Cowper. This was the Fortnightly Poetry project for May 1, 2011.<br><br>William Cowper (pronounced \"Cooper\")was an English poet and hymnodist. One of the most popular poets of his time, Cowper changed the direction of 18th century nature poetry by writing of everyday life and scenes of the English countryside. In many ways, he was one of the forerunners of Romantic poetry. Samuel Taylor Coleridge called him \"the best modern poet\", whilst William Wordsworth particularly admired his poem Yardley-Oak. He was a nephew of the poet Judith Madan.
