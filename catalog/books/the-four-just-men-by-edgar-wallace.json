{"title": "Four Just Men", "description": "In the atmosphere of political turmoil before the First World War it seemed there were villains, spies and anarchists around every corner. Some believed that the normal avenues of Law and Order were not well enough equipped to deal with such miscreants, but there are four just men who keep a vigil. Foreign Secretary Sir Philip Ramon receives a letter signed 'Four Just Men': \u201cThe Bill that you are about to pass into law is an unjust one \u2026\". This group of men is notorious and feared as they have already brought retribution to those believed guilty of crimes but are outside the reach of the law (their arm is longer and they always deliver capital justice). The Alien Extradition Bill, Ramon's cherished idea, will create barriers for those that the FJM see as forces for good, so Ramon must redact it or be himself 'removed'. A cat and mouse game ensues between the FJM and Scotland Yard, broadcast to the public by an excited press. The story is played out in two parts: Part 1 The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs; Part 2 The Council of Justice.
