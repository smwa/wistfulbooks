{"title": "Way of Holiness", "description": "Samuel Logan Brengle was a commissioner in the Salvation Army. His books are known for the practicality, joyfulness and authenticity. His life was spent working with people on the streets, so his insights into the work of the Holy Spirit are relevant to everyday life. His holiness was that of the street, the kitchen, and everyday life. His stories are of men and women living their daily lives. This is the third book in his \"Holiness\" series, which focuses on becoming like Jesus. - Summary by Beth Thomas", "duration": 6931, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "12965", "name": "Samuel Logan Brengle"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/way_of_holiness_1809_librivox/way_holiness_1809.jpg", "copyright_year": "1902", "genres": ["Christianity - Other"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Beth Thomas (1974-2020)"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Amy Gramour"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "DrPGould"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Preface", "readers": [6281], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/way_of_holiness_1809_librivox/wayofholiness_00_brengle_64kb.mp3", "duration": 188}, {"section": 1, "title": "What is Holiness?", "readers": [6281], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/way_of_holiness_1809_librivox/wayofholiness_01_brengle_64kb.mp3", "duration": 447}, {"section": 2, "title": "Why should we be Holy?", "readers": [8425], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/way_of_holiness_1809_librivox/wayofholiness_02_brengle_64kb.mp3", "duration": 519}, {"section": 3, "title": "How to get Holiness", "readers": [8425], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/way_of_holiness_1809_librivox/wayofholiness_03_brengle_64kb.mp3", "duration": 890}, {"section": 4, "title": "When can we be made Holy?", "readers": [8425], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/way_of_holiness_1809_librivox/wayofholiness_04_brengle_64kb.mp3", "duration": 372}, {"section": 5, "title": "Holiness: A love service", "readers": [6281], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/way_of_holiness_1809_librivox/wayofholiness_05_brengle_64kb.mp3", "duration": 292}, {"section": 6, "title": "Holiness and the Sanctification of the Body", "readers": [5750], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/way_of_holiness_1809_librivox/wayofholiness_06_brengle_64kb.mp3", "duration": 687}, {"section": 7, "title": "Holiness and Unconscious Influence", "readers": [5750], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/way_of_holiness_1809_librivox/wayofholiness_07_brengle_64kb.mp3", "duration": 491}, {"section": 8, "title": "Holiness and Humility", "readers": [11084], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/way_of_holiness_1809_librivox/wayofholiness_08_brengle_64kb.mp3", "duration": 484}, {"section": 9, "title": "How to keep Holiness", "readers": [10261], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/way_of_holiness_1809_librivox/wayofholiness_09_brengle_64kb.mp3", "duration": 699}, {"section": 10, "title": "Holiness and Zeal for Souls", "readers": [8425], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/way_of_holiness_1809_librivox/wayofholiness_10_brengle_64kb.mp3", "duration": 360}, {"section": 11, "title": "Holiness and Worry", "readers": [11084], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/way_of_holiness_1809_librivox/wayofholiness_11_brengle_64kb.mp3", "duration": 413}, {"section": 12, "title": "Holiness and Duty", "readers": [10261], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/way_of_holiness_1809_librivox/wayofholiness_12_brengle_64kb.mp3", "duration": 460}, {"section": 13, "title": "Holiness and Prayer", "readers": [8425], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/way_of_holiness_1809_librivox/wayofholiness_13_brengle_64kb.mp3", "duration": 629}]}
