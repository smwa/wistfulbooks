{"title": "Peregrine Falcon at the Eyrie", "description": "Bird-watching - and photographing - of a particular eyrie during the span of 3 years, where we see the female falcon hunting for food, while the tiercel - the male falcon - stays behind to feed and brood the chicks. A falcon chick is also known as eyas, hence the name eyrie for their nest. The name tiercel comes from the Latin for \"third\", either because of the belief that one in three eggs hatches a male bird, or from the fact that the male falcon is one third smaller than the female. - Summary by Rapunzelina", "duration": 6957, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "16818", "name": "Francis Heatherley"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/peregrinefalcon_2204_librivox/peregrinefalconeyrie_2204.jpg", "copyright_year": "1913", "genres": ["Animals"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Rapunzelina"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Rapunzelina"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Rapunzelina"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Dulcamara"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Introduction", "readers": [6924], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/peregrinefalcon_2204_librivox/peregrinefalcon_01_heatherley_64kb.mp3", "duration": 902}, {"section": 2, "title": "Life in the Eyrie", "readers": [6924], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/peregrinefalcon_2204_librivox/peregrinefalcon_02_heatherley_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1363}, {"section": 3, "title": "Life in the Observation Shed", "readers": [6924], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/peregrinefalcon_2204_librivox/peregrinefalcon_03_heatherley_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1203}, {"section": 4, "title": "Famine in the Eyrie", "readers": [6924], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/peregrinefalcon_2204_librivox/peregrinefalcon_04_heatherley_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1715}, {"section": 5, "title": "Last Days in the Eyrie", "readers": [6924], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/peregrinefalcon_2204_librivox/peregrinefalcon_05_heatherley_64kb.mp3", "duration": 550}, {"section": 6, "title": "General Remarks on the Peregrine", "readers": [6924], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/peregrinefalcon_2204_librivox/peregrinefalcon_06_heatherley_64kb.mp3", "duration": 728}, {"section": 7, "title": "Photographic Details", "readers": [6924], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/peregrinefalcon_2204_librivox/peregrinefalcon_07_heatherley_64kb.mp3", "duration": 496}]}
