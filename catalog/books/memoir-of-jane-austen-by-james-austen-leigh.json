{"title": "Memoir of Jane Austen", "description": "\"The Memoir of my Aunt, Jane Austen, has been received with more favour than I had ventured to expect.  The notices taken of it in the periodical press, as well as letters addressed to me by many with whom I am not personally acquainted, show that an unabated interest is still taken in every particular that can be told about her.  I am thus encouraged not only to offer a Second Edition of the Memoir, but also to enlarge it with some additional matter which I might have scrupled to intrude on the public if they had not thus seemed to call for it.  In the present Edition, the narrative is somewhat enlarged, and a few more letters are added; with a short specimen of her childish stories.  The cancelled chapter of \u2018Persuasion\u2019 is given, in compliance with wishes both publicly and privately expressed.  A fragment of a story entitled \u2018The Watsons\u2019 is printed; p. iii and extracts are given from a novel which she had begun a few months before her death; but the chief addition is a short tale never before published, called \u2018Lady Susan.\u2019 {0a}  I regret that the little which I have been able to add could not appear in my First Edition; as much of it was either unknown to me, or not at my command, when I first published; and I hope that I may claim some indulgent allowance for the difficulty of recovering little facts and feelings which had been merged half a century deep in oblivion.\" - James Edward Austen-Leigh in the Preface to <i>Memoir of Jane Austen</i>", "duration": 17977, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "4521", "name": " James Edward Austen-Leigh"}], "coverArt": "http://www.archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt/Memoir_of_Jane_Austen_1003.jpg", "copyright_year": "1870", "genres": ["*Non-fiction", "Biography & Autobiography"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "J.
