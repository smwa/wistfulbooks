Du Bois, one of the founders, as editor.  He exercised almost total control of the content and opinions of the publication until he resigned in 1934.  Du Bois was one of the most ardent advocates for total civil rights for all racial minorities and was a prolific author for the cause.  <br>\r\nFrom Du Bois\u2019 editorial: \u201cThe object of this publication is to set forth those facts and arguments which show the danger of race prejudice, particularly as manifested to-day toward colored people. It takes its name from the fact that the editors believe that this is a critical time in the history of the advancement of men.\u201d This is the premier issue where he popularizes his concept of the \u201ccolor line,\u201d and \u201csocial uplift.\u201d <br>\r\n - Summary by Larry Wilson", "duration": 5491, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "1655", "name": "W.
