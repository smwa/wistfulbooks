{"title": "Martyred Armenia", "description": "This is a first hand account of the Armenian Genocide written by a Syrian who had been a Turkish official for three and a half years. His accounts tell of the worst of humanity, and also of the noblest. The noble include families who courageously support each other in the face of death, and Turks who refuse to follow orders to kill, knowing that they shall be executed themselves for their defiance.\nThe genocide occurred just before and during World War I, and estimates as to the number of people murdered range from one to one and a half million.
