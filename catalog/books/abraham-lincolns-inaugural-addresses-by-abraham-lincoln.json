{"title": "Abraham Lincoln's Inaugural Addresses", "description": "Lincoln's first inaugural address was delivered on March 4th, 1861, as the North and South were sliding towards separation and Civil War. His second inaugural, given just weeks before his assassination, was also delivered on March 4th but four years later, in 1865. Just over a month later, April 18th, 1865, the Civil War ended with the surrender of the Confederate army. This was four days after Lincoln was shot on April 14th. He died the next day. - Summary by John Greenman", "duration": 2524, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "2233", "name": "Abraham Lincoln"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/lincolnsinauguraladdresses_1501_librivox/abraham_lincoln_inaugural_addresses_1501.jpg", "copyright_year": "1907", "genres": ["Political Science", "Short non-fiction"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "John Greenman"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "John Greenman"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Abraham Lincoln's First Inaugural Address", "readers": [107], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/lincolnsinauguraladdresses_1501_librivox/lincolnsinauguraladdresses_01_lincoln_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2095}, {"section": 2, "title": "Abraham Lincoln's Second Inaugural Address", "readers": [107], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/lincolnsinauguraladdresses_1501_librivox/lincolnsinauguraladdresses_02_lincoln_64kb.mp3", "duration": 429}]}
