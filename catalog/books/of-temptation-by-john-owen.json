{"title": "Of Temptation", "description": "To one who reads the treatise in the spirit with which the author wrote it, simply that he may judge his own heart, and know what temptation means, and be fully on his guard against it, the effect is far beyond what the mere wealth of fancy or the arts of rhetoric could produce.<br><br>From the text, Matt. xxvi. 41, the author considers in succession three topics educed from it: temptation, the means by which it prevails, and the way of preventing it. The most of the treatise is occupied with the last topic,\u2014the means of prevention. It is subdivided into inquiries,\u2014as to the evidence by which a man may know that he has entered into temptation, the directions requisite to prevent him entering into it, and the seasons when temptation may be apprehended. The discussion of this last inquiry merges very much into an illustration of the Christian duty of watchfulness, and the treatise is closed by a general exhortation to this duty. - Summary by Editor", "duration": 10889, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "5000", "name": " John Owen"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/oftemptation_2511_librivox/of_temptation_2511.jpg", "copyright_year": "1860", "genres": ["Christianity - Other"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "InTheDesert"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "InTheDesert"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Amy Gramour"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Jessie Percival"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Prefatory note by the editor\u2014To the Reader", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/oftemptation_2511_librivox/oftemptation_00_owen_64kb.mp3", "duration": 564}, {"section": 1, "title": "The words of the text, that are the foundation of the ensuing discourse\u2014The occasion of the words, with their dependence\u2014The things specially aimed at in them\u2014Things considerable in the words as to the general purpose in hand\u2014Of the general nature of temptation, wherein it consists\u2014The special nature of temptation\u2014Temptation taken actively and passively\u2014How God tempts any\u2014His end in so doing\u2014The way whereby he doth it\u2014Of temptation in its special nature; of the actions of it\u2014The true nature of temptation stated.", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/oftemptation_2511_librivox/oftemptation_01_owen_64kb.mp3", "duration": 882}, {"section": 2, "title": "What it is to \u201center into temptation\u201d\u2014Not barely being tempted\u2014Not to be conquered by it\u2014To fall into it\u2014The force of that expression\u2014Things required unto entering into temptation\u2014Satan or lust more than ordinarily importunate\u2014The soul\u2019s entanglement\u2014Seasons of such entanglements discovered\u2014Of the \u201chour of temptation,\u201d Rev. iii. 10, what it is\u2014How any temptation come to its hour\u2014How it may be known when it is so come\u2014The means of prevention prescribed by our Saviour\u2014Of watching, and what is intended thereby\u2014Of prayer.", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/oftemptation_2511_librivox/oftemptation_02_owen_64kb.mp3", "duration": 734}, {"section": 3, "title": "The doctrine\u2014Grounds of it; our Saviour\u2019s direction in this case\u2014His promise of preservation\u2014Issues of men entering into temptation\u20141.
