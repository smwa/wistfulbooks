{"title": "Gargantua and Pantagruel, Book I", "description": "<em>The Life of Gargantua and of Pantagruel</em> (in French, <em>La vie de Gargantua et de Pantagruel)</em> is a connected series of five novels written in the 16th century by Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais. It is the story of two giants, a father (Gargantua) and his son (Pantagruel) and their adventures, written in an amusing, extravagant, satirical vein. There is much crudity and scatological humor as well as a large amount of violence. Long lists of vulgar insults fill several chapters.(Summary by Wikipedia)", "duration": 27713, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "1151", "name": "Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais"}], "coverArt":
