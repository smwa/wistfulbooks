{"title": "Book of Buried Treasure", "description": "Described by the author as: BEING A TRUE HISTORY OF THE GOLD, JEWELS, AND PLATE OF PIRATES, GALLEONS, ETC., WHICH ARE SOUGHT FOR TO THIS DAY. Ralph Delahaye Paine (August 28, 1871 \u2013 April 29, 1925) was an American journalist and author popular in the early 20th century.  Paine's book tells of pirates, heroes, scoundrels, and treasure seekers creating, stealing, seeking, and sometimes finding great wealth. It also tells of treasures yet undiscovered (as of 1911, but perhaps to this day). It remains the stuff of dreams for countless kids growing up, and those of us who never grew up. - Summary by Tony Posante", "duration": 39023, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "15174", "name": "Ralph Delahaye Paine"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/bookofburiedtreasure_2103_librivox/bookofburiedtreasure_2103.jpg", "copyright_year": "1911", "genres": ["Modern (19th C)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Tony Posante"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Tony Posante"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Devorah Allen"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "ADKreader"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "An Old English Ballad", "readers": [7190], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/bookofburiedtreasure_2103_librivox/bookofburiedtreasure_00_paine_64kb.mp3", "duration": 116}, {"section": 1, "title": "The World-Wide Hunt for Vanished Riches", "readers": [7190], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/bookofburiedtreasure_2103_librivox/bookofburiedtreasure_01_paine_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2218}, {"section": 2, "title": "Captain Kidd in Fact and Fiction", "readers": [7190], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/bookofburiedtreasure_2103_librivox/bookofburiedtreasure_02_paine_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3170}, {"section": 3, "title": "Captain Kidd, His Treasure", "readers": [7190], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/bookofburiedtreasure_2103_librivox/bookofburiedtreasure_03_paine_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3132}, {"section": 4, "title": "Captain Kidd, His Trial and Death", "readers": [7190], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/bookofburiedtreasure_2103_librivox/bookofburiedtreasure_04_paine_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3031}, {"section": 5, "title": "The Wondrous Fortune of William Phips", "readers": [7190], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/bookofburiedtreasure_2103_librivox/bookofburiedtreasure_05_paine_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2667}, {"section": 6, "title": "The Bold Sea Rogue, John Quelch", "readers": [7190], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/bookofburiedtreasure_2103_librivox/bookofburiedtreasure_06_paine_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2358}, {"section": 7, "title": "The Armada Galleon of Tobermory Bay", "readers": [7190], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/bookofburiedtreasure_2103_librivox/bookofburiedtreasure_07_paine_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3574}, {"section": 8, "title": "The Lost Plate Fleet of Vigo", "readers": [7190], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/bookofburiedtreasure_2103_librivox/bookofburiedtreasure_08_paine_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2254}, {"section": 9, "title": "The Pirates' Horde of Trinidad", "readers": [7190], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/bookofburiedtreasure_2103_librivox/bookofburiedtreasure_09_paine_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2211}, {"section": 10, "title": "The Lure of Cocos Island", "readers": [7190], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/bookofburiedtreasure_2103_librivox/bookofburiedtreasure_10_paine_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1603}, {"section": 11, "title": "The Mystery of The Lutine Frigate", "readers": [7190], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/bookofburiedtreasure_2103_librivox/bookofburiedtreasure_11_paine_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1906}, {"section": 12, "title": "The Toilers of The Thetis", "readers": [7190], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/bookofburiedtreasure_2103_librivox/bookofburiedtreasure_12_paine_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2365}, {"section": 13, "title": "The Quest of El Dorado", "readers": [7190], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/bookofburiedtreasure_2103_librivox/bookofburiedtreasure_13_paine_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2317}, {"section": 14, "title": "The Wizardry of the Diving Rod", "readers": [7190], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/bookofburiedtreasure_2103_librivox/bookofburiedtreasure_14_paine_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2220}, {"section": 15, "title": "Sundry Pirates and Their Booty", "readers": [7190], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/bookofburiedtreasure_2103_librivox/bookofburiedtreasure_15_paine_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3286}, {"section": 16, "title": "Practical Hints for Treasure Seekers", "readers": [7190], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/bookofburiedtreasure_2103_librivox/bookofburiedtreasure_16_paine_64kb.mp3", "duration": 595}]}
