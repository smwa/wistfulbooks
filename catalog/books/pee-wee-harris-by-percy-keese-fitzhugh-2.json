{"title": "Pee-Wee Harris (Version 2)", "description": "Last summer I went down to where my uncle lives and spent vacation there and I had a peach of a time and all the things I did are told in the first story, but there are a lot of things left over and I\u2019m going to tell these in another story. There are snakes and peach orchards and everything down there.\nThen comes the second story and that\u2019s about a dandy mistake I made. Gee whiz! I\u2019ve made better mistakes than any feller in our troop. I didn\u2019t make it on purpose, but anyway it led to a lot of dandy adventures. That\u2019s one good thing about mistakes, anyway. But one thing sure, if I had got into the right automobile I would have just gone about two blocks. So that shows that the wrong one may even be better than the right one. Only you bet I\u2019m not going to tell you all about that story here.\nThen comes the third one and that\u2019s the one where I started the Pollywog Patrol. It didn\u2019t last long, but that\u2019s all right, because pollywogs don\u2019t last long. It wasn\u2019t a full patrol, except we were full of dessert\u2014three helpings. If you want plenty of dessert you\u2019d better read that story.\nAfter that story comes the fourth one and there\u2019s where I made the dandiest mistake I ever made. Another feller helped me make it. On account of that mistake a girl was good and sorry for the way she treated me and I bet you\u2019d say it served her right. But anyway we\u2019re good friends now.\nThen comes the fifth story and that\u2019s the craziest one of all because that\u2019s the story where I didn\u2019t go to a desert island on account of the desert island coming to me.... And it just gets crazier and crazier! - Summary from the foreword.", "duration": 13817, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "610", "name": "Percy Keese Fitzhugh"}], "coverArt":
