{"title": "Book of Cats", "description": "One day, ever so long ago, it struck me that I should like to try and write a book about Cats. I mentioned the idea to some of my friends: the first burst out laughing at the end of my opening sentence, so I refrained from entering into further details. The second said there were a hundred books about Cats already. The third said, \u201cNobody would read it,\u201d and added, \u201cBesides, what do you know of the subject?\u201d and before I had time to begin to tell him, said he expected it was very little. \u201cWhy not Dogs?\u201d asked one friend of mine, hitting upon the notion as though by inspiration. \u201cOr Horses,\u201d said some one else; \u201cor Pigs; or, look here, this is the finest notion of all:\u2014<p>\n\n<br><br>\u2018THE BOOK OF DONKIES,\n<br>BY ONE OF THE FAMILY!\u2019\u201d\n\n<br><br>Somewhat disheartened by the reception my little project had met with, I gave up the idea for awhile, and went to work upon other things. I cannot exactly remember what I did, or how much, but my book about Cats was postponed sine die, and in the meantime I made some inquiries.\n\n<br><br>I hope I have not been very prosy, and I hope, in the somewhat large collection of Cat anecdotes here brought together, \u201cthe only one worth the trouble of relating\u201d has not been omitted. If this has been the case, allow me to assure you it has not been because I have spared any trouble in gathering together my materials.
