{"title": "Leader (Dramatic Reading)", "description": "\u201cThe trouble with being a Superman, with Super powers, and knowing it, is it's so easy to overlook the unpleasant possibility of a super-superman!\u201d<br>\r\nFirst published in 1960, this epistolary short story was written by the prolific science fiction author, Murray Leinster (pen name for William F. Jenkins). The majority of the story consists of communications between two scientists. Professor Albrech Aigen is investigating the history of the former despotic ruler of the country, The Leader, while Dr. Karl Thurn is researching psionic abilities (mind control). The character, The Leader, bears a striking resemblance to Adolf Hitler. As a result, the story can be read as Leinster\u2019s allegorical exploration of Hitler\u2019s charisma and his role in causing the evils of Nazi Germany. - Summary by Elsie Selwyn<br><br>\r\n\r\nNarrator - silverquill<br>\r\nProfessor Albrech Aigen - Boomcoach<br>\r\nDr. Karl Thurn - quartertone<br>\r\nFraulein Lise Grauer - pipes<br>\r\nJanitor - JHedrick<br>\r\nGeneral Johann von Steppberg - philchenevert<br>\r\nHerr Former Police Inspector Grieg - redrun<br>\r\nPrime Minister Winston - alanmapstone<br>\r\nThe Honorable Charles Wilberforce - ChuckW<br>\r\nThe Leader - ej400<br>\r\nHerr Friedrich Holm - iBeScotty<br>\r\nGeneral Breyer - VOWinch<br>\r\nHerr Theophrastus Paracelsus Bosche - GregGiordano<br>\r\nDr. Messner - elsieselwyn<br>\r\nDr. Kundmann - LCaulkins<br>\r\nColonel Sigmund Knoeller - Inkell<br>", "duration": 3117, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "479", "name": "Murray Leinster"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/leader_dr_2307_librivox/leader_2307.jpg", "genres": ["Epistolary Fiction"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Elsie Selwyn"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Rapunzelina"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Elijah Fisher"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Section 1", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/leader_dr_2307_librivox/leader_1_leinster_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1573}, {"section": 2, "title": "Section 2", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/leader_dr_2307_librivox/leader_2_leinster_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1544}]}
