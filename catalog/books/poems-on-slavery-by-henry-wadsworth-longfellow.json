{"title": "Poems on Slavery", "description": "This is a short volume of abolitionist poetry by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, first published in 1842. As Wikipedia notes, Longfellow himself was not entirely satisfied with his work: \"However, as Longfellow himself wrote, the poems were 'so mild that even a Slaveholder might read them without losing his appetite for breakfast'. A critic for The Dial agreed, calling it 'the thinnest of all Mr. Longfellow's thin books; spirited and polished like its forerunners; but the topic would warrant a deeper tone'. The New England Anti-Slavery Association, however, was satisfied enough with the collection to reprint it for further distribution.\" Despite these shortcomings, however, this volume is of historical importance and will interest many listeners. - Summary by Carolin", "duration": 945, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "43", "name": "Henry Wadsworth Longfellow"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/poems_on_slavery_1708_librivox/poemsonslavery_1708.jpg", "copyright_year": "1842", "genres": ["Poetry"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Crln Yldz Ksr"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Crln Yldz Ksr"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Nemo"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "The Noble Horse, by Philip Massinger", "readers": [11782], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/poems_on_slavery_1708_librivox/slavery_00_longfellow_64kb.mp3", "duration": 59}, {"section": 1, "title": "To William E.
