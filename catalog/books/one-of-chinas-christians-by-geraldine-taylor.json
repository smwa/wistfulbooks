{"title": "One of China's Christians: Pastor Hsi of North China", "description": "The second of two volumes telling the life story of Pastor Hsi, a Confucian scholar from Shanxi province in Northern China who became a Christian in the 1870s.\r\n\r\nShortly after his conversion, those around Pastor His started to notice a difference.  He gave up his opium pipe and sought reconciliation with estranged family members, a step unheard of in an honor-based society.  His desire to help other opium addicts led him to start a series of \u201crefuges\u201d, which in turn became the seeds of the first churches in Shanxi province.\r\n\r\nPastor His was a man of prayer who lived out the power of the gospel in a culture seeped in the ancestor worship and darkness.  His life was not without mistakes and regrets, but in reading his story, Christians today can be inspired by a faithful follower of Jesus who lived in the power of the Spirit and helped to plant the church which continues to faithfully follow Jesus in the China of today.
