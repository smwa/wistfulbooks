{"title": "Childe Harold's Pilgrimage", "description": "Childe Harold's Pilgrimage is a lengthy narrative poem in four parts written by Lord Byron. It was published between 1812 and 1818 and is dedicated to \"Ianthe\". The poem describes the travels and reflections of a world-weary young man who, disillusioned with a life of pleasure and revelry, looks for distraction in foreign lands. In a wider sense, it is an expression of the melancholy and disillusionment felt by a generation weary of the wars of the post-Revolutionary and Napoleonic eras. The title comes from the term childe, a medieval title for a young man who was a candidate for knighthood. - Summary by Wikipedia", "duration": 15375, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "39", "name": "George Gordon, Lord Byron"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/childeharoldspilgrimage_1805_librivox/childe_harold_pilgrimage_1805.jpg", "copyright_year": "1812", "genres": ["Poetry"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Peter Tucker"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Peter Tucker"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Barry Eads"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Newgatenovelist"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Dedication", "readers": [8799], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/childeharoldspilgrimage_1805_librivox/childeharoldspilgrimage_00_byron_64kb.mp3", "duration": 184}, {"section": 1, "title": "Canto the First", "readers": [8799], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/childeharoldspilgrimage_1805_librivox/childeharoldspilgrimage_01_byron_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2990}, {"section": 2, "title": "Canto the Second", "readers": [8799], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/childeharoldspilgrimage_1805_librivox/childeharoldspilgrimage_02_byron_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3038}, {"section": 3, "title": "Canto the Third", "readers": [8799], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/childeharoldspilgrimage_1805_librivox/childeharoldspilgrimage_03_byron_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3628}, {"section": 4, "title": "Canto the Fourth Part 1", "readers": [8799], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/childeharoldspilgrimage_1805_librivox/childeharoldspilgrimage_04_byron_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2884}, {"section": 5, "title": "Canto the Fourth Part 2", "readers": [8799], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/childeharoldspilgrimage_1805_librivox/childeharoldspilgrimage_05_byron_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2651}]}
