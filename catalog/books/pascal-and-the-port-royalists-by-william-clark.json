{"title": "Pascal and the Port Royalists", "description": "Pascal is of the small number of those [men] in whom the man infinitely transcends his actions. The writings of Pascal are the finest that France possesses; yet they contain nothing of equal value with the Life of Pascal written by his sister in a few pages. It is of such writings and of such a life that we have to speak in this volume; and it is of unspeakable advantage to the student that he should possess a source of information respecting the early days of Pascal of such unquestionable authority. Nearly all that we know of Pascal is derived from this Life and from his own writings, and especially from the Provincial Letters and the Thoughts. These works have been commented upon, controverted, and defended; and there is little to be said on either side which has not been said already. In the present volume Pascal chiefly speaks for himself, and the comments upon his statements are generally brief. - Summary by Adapted from Preface", "duration": 23073, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "17872", "name": "William Clark"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/pascalportroyalists_2411_librivox/pascalportroyalists_2412.jpg", "copyright_year": "1902", "genres": ["Biography & Autobiography", "Early Modern"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "InTheDesert"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "J.
