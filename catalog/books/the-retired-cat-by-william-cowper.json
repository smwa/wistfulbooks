{"title": "Retired Cat", "description": "William Cowper was an English poet and hymnodist. One of the most popular poets of his time, Cowper changed the direction of 18th century nature poetry by writing of everyday life and scenes of the English countryside. In many ways, he was one of the forerunners of Romantic poetry.\nHis religious sentiment and association with John Newton (who wrote the hymn \"Amazing Grace\") led to much of the poetry for which he is best remembered. His poem \"Light Shining out of Darkness\" gave English the phrase: \"God moves in a mysterious way/His wonders to perform.\" Wikipedia - Summary by Wikipedia", "duration": 4589, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "2023", "name": "William Cowper"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/the_retired_cat_1601.poem_librivox/retiredcat_1601.jpg", "copyright_year": "1849", "genres": ["Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "The Retired Cat - Read by ALP", "readers": [4705], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/the_retired_cat_1601.poem_librivox/retiredcat_cowper_alp_64kb.mp3", "duration": 336}, {"section": 2, "title": "The Retired Cat - Read by BK", "readers": [8786], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/the_retired_cat_1601.poem_librivox/retiredcat_cowper_bk_64kb.mp3", "duration": 340}, {"section": 3, "title": "The Retired Cat - Read by BLT", "readers": [6281], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/the_retired_cat_1601.poem_librivox/retiredcat_cowper_blt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 310}, {"section": 4, "title": "The Retired Cat - Read by BSD", "readers": [10402], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/the_retired_cat_1601.poem_librivox/retiredcat_cowper_bsd_64kb.mp3", "duration": 324}, {"section": 5, "title": "The Retired Cat - Read by CHA", "readers": [10515], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/the_retired_cat_1601.poem_librivox/retiredcat_cowper_cha_64kb.mp3", "duration": 303}, {"section": 6, "title": "The Retired Cat - Read by DL", "readers": [2911], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/the_retired_cat_1601.poem_librivox/retiredcat_cowper_dl_64kb.mp3", "duration": 356}, {"section": 7, "title": "The Retired Cat - Read by EL", "readers": [9872], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/the_retired_cat_1601.poem_librivox/retiredcat_cowper_el_64kb.mp3", "duration": 342}, {"section": 8, "title": "The Retired Cat - Read by GG", "readers": [8011], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/the_retired_cat_1601.poem_librivox/retiredcat_cowper_gg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 398}, {"section": 9, "title": "The Retired Cat - Read by GPA", "readers": [10526], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/the_retired_cat_1601.poem_librivox/retiredcat_cowper_gpa_64kb.mp3", "duration": 343}, {"section": 10, "title": "The Retired Cat - Read by JDB", "readers": [10396], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/the_retired_cat_1601.poem_librivox/retiredcat_cowper_jdb_64kb.mp3", "duration": 376}, {"section": 11, "title": "The Retired Cat - Read by MK", "readers": [8051], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/the_retired_cat_1601.poem_librivox/retiredcat_cowper_mk_64kb.mp3", "duration": 341}, {"section": 12, "title": "The Retired Cat - Read by RG", "readers": [2607], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/the_retired_cat_1601.poem_librivox/retiredcat_cowper_rg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 392}, {"section": 13, "title": "The Retired Cat - Read by TA", "readers": [10289], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/the_retired_cat_1601.poem_librivox/retiredcat_cowper_ta_64kb.mp3", "duration": 428}]}
