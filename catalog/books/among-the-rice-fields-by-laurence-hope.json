{"title": "Among the Rice Fields", "description": "LibriVox volunteers bring you 22 recordings of Among the Rice Fields by Laurence Hope..<br>\nThis was the Weekly Poetry project for August 16, 2020.   <br> ------<br>\nViolet Nicolson was an English poet who wrote under the pseudonym Laurence Hope. In 1901, she published Garden of Kama, which was published a year later in America under the title India's Love Lyrics. She attempted to pass these off as translations of various poets, but this claim soon fell under suspicion. Her poems often used imagery and symbols from the poets of the North-West Frontier of India and the Sufi poets of Persia. She was among the most popular romantic poets of the Edwardian era. Her poems are typically about unrequited love and loss and often, the death that followed such an unhappy state of affairs. Many of them have an air of autobiography or confession.
