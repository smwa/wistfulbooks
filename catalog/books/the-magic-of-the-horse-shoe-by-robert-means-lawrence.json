{"title": "Magic of the Horse-Shoe", "description": "The study of the origin and history of popular customs and beliefs affords an insight, otherwise unattainable, into the operations of the human mind in early times. Superstitions, however trivial in themselves, relics of paganism though they be, and oftentimes comparable to baneful weeds, are now considered proper subjects for scientific research. While the ignorant savage is a slave to many superstitious fancies which dominate his every action, the educated man strives to be free from such a bondage, yet recognizes as profitable the study of those same beliefs. The heterogeneous character of the material drawn from so many sources has rendered it difficult, if not impossible, to follow any distinctly systematic treatment of the subject. However, the development in recent years of a widespread interest in all branches of folk-lore warrants the hope that any volume devoted to this subject, and representing somewhat diligent research, may have a certain value, in spite of its imperfections. The expert folklorist may find much to criticize; but this book, treating of popular beliefs, is intended for popular reading. It has been the writer\u2019s aim to make the chapter on the Horse-Shoe as exhaustive as possible, as this attractive symbol of superstition does not appear to have received hitherto the attention which it merits.  - Summary by Robert Means Lawrence", "duration": 29830, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "16643", "name": "Robert Means  Lawrence"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/magichorseshoe_2211_librivox/horse_shoe_2211.jpg", "copyright_year": "1898", "genres": ["Early Modern"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Amy Gramour"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Amy Gramour"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Christine Rottger"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Preface", "readers": [6754], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/magichorseshoe_2211_librivox/horseshoe_00_lawrence_64kb.mp3", "duration": 141}, {"section": 1, "title": "The Magic of the Horseshoe Part 1", "readers": [6754], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/magichorseshoe_2211_librivox/horseshoe_01_lawrence_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1344}, {"section": 2, "title": "The Magic of the Horseshoe -Part 2", "readers": [17223], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/magichorseshoe_2211_librivox/horseshoe_02_lawrence_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1778}, {"section": 3, "title": "The Magic of the Horseshoe -Part 3", "readers": [17999], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/magichorseshoe_2211_librivox/horseshoe_03_lawrence_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1844}, {"section": 4, "title": "The Magic of the Horseshoe -Part 4", "readers": [16576], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/magichorseshoe_2211_librivox/horseshoe_04_lawrence_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2443}, {"section": 5, "title": "The Magic of the Horseshoe -Part 5", "readers": [7794], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/magichorseshoe_2211_librivox/horseshoe_05_lawrence_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2417}, {"section": 6, "title": "The Magic of the Horseshoe -Part 6", "readers": [16576], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/magichorseshoe_2211_librivox/horseshoe_06_lawrence_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2043}, {"section": 7, "title": "Fortune and Luck", "readers": [16209], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/magichorseshoe_2211_librivox/horseshoe_07_lawrence_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1300}, {"section": 8, "title": "The Folk-Lore of Common Salt  -Part 1", "readers": [15806], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/magichorseshoe_2211_librivox/horseshoe_08_lawrence_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2060}, {"section": 9, "title": "The Folk-Lore of Common Salt  -Part 2", "readers": [15806], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/magichorseshoe_2211_librivox/horseshoe_09_lawrence_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2493}, {"section": 10, "title": "The Omens of Sneezing -Part 1", "readers": [17290], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/magichorseshoe_2211_librivox/horseshoe_10_lawrence_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1112}, {"section": 11, "title": "The Omens of Sneezing -Part 2", "readers": [17290], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/magichorseshoe_2211_librivox/horseshoe_11_lawrence_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1310}, {"section": 12, "title": "Days of Good and Evil Omen \u2013Part 1", "readers": [16576], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/magichorseshoe_2211_librivox/horseshoe_12_lawrence_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1859}, {"section": 13, "title": "Days of Good and Evil Omen \u2013Part 2", "readers": [16576], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/magichorseshoe_2211_librivox/horseshoe_13_lawrence_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1947}, {"section": 14, "title": "Superstitious Dealings with Animals -Part 1", "readers": [16106], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/magichorseshoe_2211_librivox/horseshoe_14_lawrence_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1550}, {"section": 15, "title": "Superstitious Dealings with Animals -Part 2", "readers": [16576], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/magichorseshoe_2211_librivox/horseshoe_15_lawrence_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1378}, {"section": 16, "title": "The Luck of Odd Numbers \u2013Part 1", "readers": [17023], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/magichorseshoe_2211_librivox/horseshoe_16_lawrence_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1535}, {"section": 17, "title": "The Luck of Odd Numbers \u2013Part 2", "readers": [7794], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/magichorseshoe_2211_librivox/horseshoe_17_lawrence_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1276}]}
