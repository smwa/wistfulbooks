{"title": "From the Deep Woods to Civilization: Chapters in the Autobiography of an Indian", "description": "<i>From the Deep Woods to Civilization</i> is the sequel to <i>Indian Boyhood</i>. Charles Eastman (Ohiyesa) gives his account of what it was like to transition from the ways of his Indian life to that of the white man. His father, long thought dead, had converted to Christianity and wished the same for his son as well as receiving education in the white man's school. At the age of 15, Ohiyesa must learn to balance the old familiar life of the American Indian with that of the new in the world of the white man, one of his first acts being the cutting of his long hair and attending school. It also chronicles his life of college to becoming a doctor at Pine Ridge in South Dakota, his marriage to Elaine Goodale, and his involvement in politics, the YMCA, and Boy Scouts of America.
