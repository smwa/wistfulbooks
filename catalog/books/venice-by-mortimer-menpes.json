{"title": "Venice", "description": "Following his assignment to South Africa as Black and White Magazine's war artist, Mortimer Menpes travelled extensively, becoming the artist of choice for A. & C.

Menpes's text, which serves well as a guide to the art and architecture of present-day Venice, is enlivened by his enthusiasm for everything Venetian, and especially by his satirical portrait of the community of foreign artists who gather at the Panada restaurant. - Summary by Phil Benson", "duration": 17552, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "17613", "name": "Mortimer Menpes"}, {"id": "17615", "name": "Dorothy Menpes"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/venice_2408_librivox/Venice_2408.jpg", "copyright_year": "1904", "genres": ["Travel & Geography"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Phil Benson"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Phil Benson"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Annise"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Newgatenovelist"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Arrival and First Impresssions", "readers": [6097], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/venice_2408_librivox/venice_01_menpes_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1248}, {"section": 2, "title": "History", "readers": [6097], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/venice_2408_librivox/venice_02_menpes_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1761}, {"section": 3, "title": "A Glimpse Into Bohemia", "readers": [6097], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/venice_2408_librivox/venice_03_menpes_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1225}, {"section": 4, "title": "Architecture", "readers": [6097], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/venice_2408_librivox/venice_04_menpes_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1749}, {"section": 5, "title": "St. Mark's", "readers": [6097], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/venice_2408_librivox/venice_05_menpes_64kb.mp3", "duration": 962}, {"section": 6, "title": "Painters of the Renaissance", "readers": [6097], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/venice_2408_librivox/venice_06_menpes_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2830}, {"section": 7, "title": "Streets, Shops, and Courtyards", "readers": [6097], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/venice_2408_librivox/venice_07_menpes_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1969}, {"section": 8, "title": "The Islands of the Lagoon", "readers": [6097], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/venice_2408_librivox/venice_08_menpes_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1855}, {"section": 9, "title": "Social Ups and Downs", "readers": [6097], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/venice_2408_librivox/venice_09_menpes_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1474}, {"section": 10, "title": "Gondolas and Gondoliers", "readers": [6097], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/venice_2408_librivox/venice_10_menpes_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2479}]}
