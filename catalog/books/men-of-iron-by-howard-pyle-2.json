{"title": "Men of Iron (Version 2 Dramatic Reading)", "description": "\"The year 1400 opened with more than usual peacefulness in England. Only a few months before, Richard II\u2014weak, wicked, and treacherous\u2014had been dethroned, and Henry IV declared King in his stead. But it was only a seeming peacefulness, lasting but for a little while; for though King Henry proved himself a just and a merciful man\u2014as justice and mercy went with the men of iron of those days\u2014and though he did not care to shed blood needlessly, there were many noble families who had been benefited by King Richard during his reign, and who had lost somewhat of their power and prestige from the coming in of the new King. <br><br>\r\n...Their plan had been to fall upon the King and his adherents, and to massacre them during a great tournament, to be held at Oxford.

Those few who found friends faithful and bold enough to afford them shelter, dragged those friends down in their own ruin.\r\nJust such a case was that of the father of the boy hero of this story, the blind Lord Gilbert Reginald Falworth, Baron of Falworth and Easterbridge, who, though having no part in the plot, suffered through it ruin, utter and complete...\" (Taken from the
