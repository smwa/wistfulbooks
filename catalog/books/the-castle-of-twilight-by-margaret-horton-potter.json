{"title": "Castle of Twilight", "description": "\"Wistfully I deliver up to you my simple story, knowing that the first suggestion of \u201chistorical novel\u201d will bring before you an image of dreary woodenness and unceasing carnage. Yet if you will have the graciousness but to unlock my castle door you will find within only two or three quiet folk who will distress you with no battles nor strange oaths. Even in the days of rival Princes and never-ending wars there dwelt still a few who took no part in the moil of life, but lived with gentle pleasures and unvoiced sorrows, somewhat as you and I; wherefore, I pray you, cross the moat. The drawbridge is down for you, and will not be raised, if, after introduction to the Chatelaine, you desire speedily to retreat.\"\n - Summary by Margaret Horton Potter", "duration": 31558, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "15225", "name": "Margaret Horton Potter"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/castle_of_twilight_2103_librivox/castle_of_twilight_2103.jpg", "copyright_year": "1903", "genres": ["Historical Fiction"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Lynne T"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Lynne T"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Wayne Cooke"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "The Desolation of Age", "readers": [15667], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/castle_of_twilight_2103_librivox/castleoftwilight_01_potter_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1823}, {"section": 2, "title": "The Silence of Youth", "readers": [11954], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/castle_of_twilight_2103_librivox/castleoftwilight_02_potter_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2593}, {"section": 3, "title": "Flammecoeur", "readers": [14827], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/castle_of_twilight_2103_librivox/castleoftwilight_03_potter_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2389}, {"section": 4, "title": "The Passion", "readers": [14827], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/castle_of_twilight_2103_librivox/castleoftwilight_04_potter_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2026}, {"section": 5, "title": "Shadows", "readers": [15301], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/castle_of_twilight_2103_librivox/castleoftwilight_05_potter_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2517}, {"section": 6, "title": "A Love-Strain", "readers": [15757], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/castle_of_twilight_2103_librivox/castleoftwilight_06_potter_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1662}, {"section": 7, "title": "The Lost Lenore", "readers": [14141], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/castle_of_twilight_2103_librivox/castleoftwilight_07_potter_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2089}, {"section": 8, "title": "To a Trumpet-Call", "readers": [14141], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/castle_of_twilight_2103_librivox/castleoftwilight_08_potter_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1778}, {"section": 9, "title": "The Storm", "readers": [15189], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/castle_of_twilight_2103_librivox/castleoftwilight_09_potter_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1920}, {"section": 10, "title": "From Rennes", "readers": [15373], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/castle_of_twilight_2103_librivox/castleoftwilight_10_potter_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2385}, {"section": 11, "title": "The Wanderer", "readers": [15312], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/castle_of_twilight_2103_librivox/castleoftwilight_11_potter_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1858}, {"section": 12, "title": "Laure", "readers": [14928], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/castle_of_twilight_2103_librivox/castleoftwilight_12_potter_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2118}, {"section": 13, "title": "Lenore", "readers": [15664], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/castle_of_twilight_2103_librivox/castleoftwilight_13_potter_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2284}, {"section": 14, "title": "Eleanore", "readers": [15816], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/castle_of_twilight_2103_librivox/castleoftwilight_14_potter_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2201}, {"section": 15, "title": "The Rising Tide", "readers": [13952], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/castle_of_twilight_2103_librivox/castleoftwilight_15_potter_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1364}, {"section": 16, "title": "The Middle of the Valley", "readers": [14945], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/castle_of_twilight_2103_librivox/castleoftwilight_16_potter_64kb.mp3", "duration": 551}]}
