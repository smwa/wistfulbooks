{"title": "Mark Twain", "description": "Many writers have penned studies of Mark Twain's life and work through the years. Twain authorized this biography, having met and hosted the writer, Archibald Henderson, on a few occasions.  Henderson considered this work to be an homage to one of his biggest idols, who guided him through his youth and adolescence. He writes, \"It is an appreciation originating in the heart of one who loved Mark Twain\u2019s works for a generation before he ever met Samuel L. Clemens. It is an interpretation springing from the conviction that Mark Twain was a great American who comprehensively incorporated and realized his own country and his own age as no American has so completely done before him.\"  - Summary by John Greenman", "duration": 20178, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "13190", "name": "Archibald Henderson"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/marktwain_1802_librivox/mark_twain_1802.jpg", "copyright_year": "1911", "genres": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "John Greenman"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "John Greenman"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "TriciaG"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Helen Z.
