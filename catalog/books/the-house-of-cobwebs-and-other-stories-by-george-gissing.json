{"title": "House of Cobwebs and Other Stories", "description": "George Gissing was a prolific English writer of novels and short stories. Among his best known novels is The Odd Women, which was influenced by George Eliot, whose work he greatly admired. Another of his famous works, New Grub Street, entails a blunt critique of the working class life he knew by experience, especially during a number of the years he spent in the United States.<br /><br />This collection of stories ranges from the humorous to the tragic. Throughout, Gissing pokes mild fun at his characters' human frailties: egotism, self-satisfaction, and pomposity, among others. - Summary by Kirsten Wever", "duration": 34818, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "319", "name": "George Gissing"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/houseofcobwebs_1704_librivox/house_cobwebs_1704.jpg", "copyright_year": "1906", "genres": ["Published 1900 onward", "Single Author Collections"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Kirsten Wever"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Kirsten Wever"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "TriciaG"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "TriciaG"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "The House of Cobwebs", "readers": [5789], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/houseofcobwebs_1704_librivox/houseofcobwebs_01_gissing_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3214}, {"section": 2, "title": "A Capitalist", "readers": [5789], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/houseofcobwebs_1704_librivox/houseofcobwebs_02_gissing_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2117}, {"section": 3, "title": "Christopherson", "readers": [5789], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/houseofcobwebs_1704_librivox/houseofcobwebs_03_gissing_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2416}, {"section": 4, "title": "Humplebee", "readers": [5789], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/houseofcobwebs_1704_librivox/houseofcobwebs_04_gissing_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2398}, {"section": 5, "title": "The Scrupulous Father", "readers": [5789], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/houseofcobwebs_1704_librivox/houseofcobwebs_05_gissing_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2191}, {"section": 6, "title": "A Poor Gentleman", "readers": [5789], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/houseofcobwebs_1704_librivox/houseofcobwebs_06_gissing_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2075}, {"section": 7, "title": "Miss Rodney's Leisure", "readers": [5789], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/houseofcobwebs_1704_librivox/houseofcobwebs_07_gissing_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2561}, {"section": 8, "title": "A Charming Family", "readers": [5789], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/houseofcobwebs_1704_librivox/houseofcobwebs_08_gissing_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3275}, {"section": 9, "title": "A Daughter of the Lodge", "readers": [5789], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/houseofcobwebs_1704_librivox/houseofcobwebs_09_gissing_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1923}, {"section": 10, "title": "The Riding Whip", "readers": [5789], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/houseofcobwebs_1704_librivox/houseofcobwebs_10_gissing_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2573}, {"section": 11, "title": "Fate and the Apothecary", "readers": [5789], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/houseofcobwebs_1704_librivox/houseofcobwebs_11_gissing_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1518}, {"section": 12, "title": "Topham's Chance", "readers": [5789], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/houseofcobwebs_1704_librivox/houseofcobwebs_12_gissing_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1577}, {"section": 13, "title": "A Lodger in Maze Pond", "readers": [5789], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/houseofcobwebs_1704_librivox/houseofcobwebs_13_gissing_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2853}, {"section": 14, "title": "The Salt of the Earth", "readers": [5789], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/houseofcobwebs_1704_librivox/houseofcobwebs_14_gissing_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1561}, {"section": 15, "title": "The Pig and Whistle", "readers": [5789], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/houseofcobwebs_1704_librivox/houseofcobwebs_15_gissing_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2566}]}
