{"title": "Land of Mist", "description": "The Land of Mist is a novel by British writer Arthur Conan Doyle, published in 1926.\r\n\r\nAlthough this is a Professor Challenger story, it centres more on his daughter Enid and his old friend Edward Malone. Another friend from the 1912 novel The Lost World, Lord John Roxton, is also involved in the novel's second half. Professor Summerlee, who has died of old age around this time, is referred to by the mediums (much to the anger of Professor Challenger). - Summary by Wikipedia", "duration": 29068, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "467", "name": "Sir Arthur Conan Doyle"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/land_of_mist_2311_librivox/land_mist_2311.jpg", "copyright_year": "1926", "genres": ["Detective Fiction"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Amy Gramour"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Amy Gramour"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Elsie Selwyn"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Chapter 1.
