{"title": "Five Little Peppers in the Little Brown House", "description": "\u201cWhat ever became of Polly Pepper\u2019s famous Chicken Pie, and also Phronsie\u2019s red-topped shoes?\u201d the friends of the \u201cFive Little Peppers\u201d keep asking. \u201cWe have searched through all the Pepper Books, and cannot find them. Please give us those two stories again.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt last all these requests are granted in this book, containing, first of all, those two stories that make the very beginning of all the records of the Pepper Family. Indeed, there wasn\u2019t any Pepper Family before they were written; nor any Little Brown House, not a sign of one; nor any Badgertown even, till Margaret Sidney one day wrote \u201cPolly Pepper\u2019s Chicken Pie\u201d and sent it to the Wide Awake Magazine.\r\n\r\nAnd no one could be more astonished than was she\u2014for the record was so simple\u2014when the editor wrote for another one just like it. So \u201cPhronsie Pepper\u2019s New Shoes\u201d was written.\r\n\r\nAnd then\u2014well, the editor wrote that the Wide Awake must have enough stories for one year, to be connected. So Margaret Sidney had to go regularly after that to the \u201cLittle Brown House\u201d and write down all the records just as Mrs. Pepper and the Five Little Peppers told them to her, and then those insatiable editors wrote that they must have a book\u2014nothing more nor less\u2014because the children\u2019s letters to them from all over the country demanded it. So that was the way it all began. And of course the two separate stories\u2014the motif, as it were, for the book\u2014had to be left out.\r\n\r\nSo here they are now in the post of honor\u2014leading off in the very front of the volume, as is quite proper; the other stories (which are all just newly written expressly for this book) following humbly after in the wake of Phronsie\u2019s red-topped shoes.\r\n\r\nSummary from the Preface by Margaret Sidney", "duration": 32732, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "490", "name": "Margaret Sidney"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/fivelittlepeppersinthelittlebrownhouse_2404_librivox/5littlepeppers_2404.jpg", "copyright_year": "1907", "genres": ["Family"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Winnifred Assmann"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "lorda"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Elijah Fisher"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "1 -
