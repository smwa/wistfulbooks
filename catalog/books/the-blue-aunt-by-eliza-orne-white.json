{"title": "Blue Aunt", "description": "This is a very cute children's book. Mr. West's half-sister Matilda is orphaned and she comes staying with the family for a while. It looks like Mr West doesn't like her very much, her being \"blue\" and all. What this means is an entirely unknown concept to his children, but they also anticipate that they won't like her very much either. But then Matilda arrives and neither her skin nor her hair are blue at all, and she turns out very very nice - winning the hearts of the children in no time. - Summary by Carolin", "duration": 12421, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "2795", "name": "Eliza Orne White"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/blue_aunt_1806_librivox/blueaunt_1807.jpg", "copyright_year": "1918", "genres": ["Family"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Crln Yldz Ksr"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Crln Yldz Ksr"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Devorah Allen"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "The Letter", "readers": [12028], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/blue_aunt_1806_librivox/blueaunt_01_white_64kb.mp3", "duration": 628}, {"section": 2, "title": "The Blue Aunt Comes", "readers": [12252], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/blue_aunt_1806_librivox/blueaunt_02_white_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1069}, {"section": 3, "title": "Nancy Merrifield and the Stranger", "readers": [12314], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/blue_aunt_1806_librivox/blueaunt_03_white_64kb.mp3", "duration": 814}, {"section": 4, "title": "The Plaid Dress", "readers": [12314], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/blue_aunt_1806_librivox/blueaunt_04_white_64kb.mp3", "duration": 749}, {"section": 5, "title": "Evelyn's War Work", "readers": [12314], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/blue_aunt_1806_librivox/blueaunt_05_white_64kb.mp3", "duration": 918}, {"section": 6, "title": "The Blue Aunt's Plan", "readers": [12314], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/blue_aunt_1806_librivox/blueaunt_06_white_64kb.mp3", "duration": 455}, {"section": 7, "title": "A Safe and Sane Fourth of July", "readers": [12312], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/blue_aunt_1806_librivox/blueaunt_07_white_64kb.mp3", "duration": 704}, {"section": 8, "title": "The Journey", "readers": [12536], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/blue_aunt_1806_librivox/blueaunt_08_white_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1012}, {"section": 9, "title": "The Little Gays", "readers": [12536], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/blue_aunt_1806_librivox/blueaunt_09_white_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1155}, {"section": 10, "title": "The Birthday Dinner", "readers": [12536], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/blue_aunt_1806_librivox/blueaunt_10_white_64kb.mp3", "duration": 951}, {"section": 11, "title": "The Story", "readers": [12536], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/blue_aunt_1806_librivox/blueaunt_11_white_64kb.mp3", "duration": 699}, {"section": 12, "title": "Jim and the Orphans", "readers": [12536], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/blue_aunt_1806_librivox/blueaunt_12_white_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1202}, {"section": 13, "title": "The Home-Coming", "readers": [10261], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/blue_aunt_1806_librivox/blueaunt_13_white_64kb.mp3", "duration": 571}, {"section": 14, "title": "The Letter from France", "readers": [10261], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/blue_aunt_1806_librivox/blueaunt_14_white_64kb.mp3", "duration": 559}, {"section": 15, "title": "The Thanksgiving Candle", "readers": [10261], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/blue_aunt_1806_librivox/blueaunt_15_white_64kb.mp3", "duration": 935}]}
