{"title": "Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town", "description": " Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town is a sequence of stories by Stephen Leacock, first published in 1912. It is generally considered to be one of the most enduring classics of Canadian humorous literature.<br /><br />    The fictional setting for these stories is Mariposa, a small town on the shore of Lake Wissanotti. Although drawn from his experiences in Orillia, Ontario, Leacock writes in the introduction:<br /><br />\u201cMariposa is not a real town. On the contrary, it is about seventy or eighty of them. You may find them all the way from Lake Superior to the sea, with the same square streets and the same maple trees and the same churches and hotels.\u201d<br /><br />This work has remained popular for its universal appeal. Many of the characters, though modelled on townspeople of Orillia, are small town archetypes. Their shortcomings and weaknesses are presented in a humorous but affectionate way.<br /><br /> Often, the narrator greatly exaggerates the importance of the events in Mariposa compared to the rest of the world. For example, when there is a country-wide election, \u201cthe town of Mariposa, was, of course, the storm centre and focus point of the whole turmoil.\u201d (Summary from Wikipedia)", "duration": 20635, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "1193", "name": "Stephen Leacock"}], "coverArt": "http://archive.org/download/sunshine_sketches_librivox/Sunshine_Sketches_Little_Town_1105.jpg", "copyright_year": "1912", "genres": ["Humorous Fiction"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Esther"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Nikolle Doolin"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Preface", "readers": [205], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/sunshine_sketches_librivox/sunshinesketches_00_stephenleacock_64kb.mp3", "duration": 579}, {"section": 1, "title": "The Hostelry of Mr. Smith", "readers": [476], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/sunshine_sketches_librivox/sunshinesketches_01_stephenleacock_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3086}, {"section": 2, "title": "The Speculations of Jefferson Thorpe", "readers": [476], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/sunshine_sketches_librivox/sunshinesketches_02_stephenleacock_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2210}, {"section": 3, "title": "The Marine Excursion of the Knights of Pythias", "readers": [460], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/sunshine_sketches_librivox/sunshinesketches_03_stephenleacock_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2058}, {"section": 4, "title": "The Ministrations of the Rev.
