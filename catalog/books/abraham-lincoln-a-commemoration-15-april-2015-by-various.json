{"title": "Abraham Lincoln:  A Commemoration \u2013 15 April 2015", "description": " April 14-15th, 2015, is the 150th year anniversary of President Abraham Lincoln\u2019s assassination. This is a collection of pieces to mark that occasion. Whitman\u2019s poems, written shortly after the death, express his intense grief. Here are prose pieces that Whitman composed in the years following. Included too are three other eulogies regarded by Lincoln scholars as among the best, as well as a narrative from one of the doctors who attended the dying president and two speeches in the British Parliament. And finally three of the President\u2019s finest compositions.
