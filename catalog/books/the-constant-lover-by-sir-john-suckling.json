{"title": "Constant Lover", "description": "Sir John Suckling (1609-42) was one of the Cavalier poets at the court of King Charles I of England. He took up arms in the conflicts of that era but was said to be more fit for the boudoir than the battlefield. He was a prolific lover, a sparkling wit and an excessive gamester and is credited with inventing the card game, Cribbage. Cavalier poetry was witty, decorous and sometimes naughty. The Constant Lover displays these elements as well as Suckling's conversational ease and charm.", "duration": 567, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "1334", "name": "Sir John Suckling"}], "coverArt": "http://www.archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt13/Constant_Lover_1112.jpg", "copyright_year": "1914", "genres": ["Poetry", "Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Rachel Lintern"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Kristin Hughes"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "The Constant Lover - Read by AC", "readers": [2587], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/constantlover_0805_librivox/constantlover_suckling_ac_64kb.mp3", "duration": 45}, {"section": 2, "title": "The Constant Lover - Read by ACJ", "readers": [2481], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/constantlover_0805_librivox/constantlover_suckling_acj_64kb.mp3", "duration": 67}, {"section": 3, "title": "The Constant Lover - Read by CF", "readers": [1944], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/constantlover_0805_librivox/constantlover_suckling_cf_64kb.mp3", "duration": 56}, {"section": 4, "title": "The Constant Lover - Read by DES", "readers": [1759], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/constantlover_0805_librivox/constantlover_suckling_des_64kb.mp3", "duration": 56}, {"section": 5, "title": "The Constant Lover - Read by DRB", "readers": [94], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/constantlover_0805_librivox/constantlover_suckling_drb_64kb.mp3", "duration": 55}, {"section": 6, "title": "The Constant Lover - Read by EZWA", "readers": [123], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/constantlover_0805_librivox/constantlover_suckling_ezwa_64kb.mp3", "duration": 55}, {"section": 7, "title": "The Constant Lover - Read by JA", "readers": [1018], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/constantlover_0805_librivox/constantlover_suckling_ja_64kb.mp3", "duration": 48}, {"section": 8, "title": "The Constant Lover - Read by LAH", "readers": [1212], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/constantlover_0805_librivox/constantlover_suckling_lah_64kb.mp3", "duration": 52}, {"section": 9, "title": "The Constant Lover - Read by SAC", "readers": [2623], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/constantlover_0805_librivox/constantlover_suckling_sac_64kb.mp3", "duration": 84}, {"section": 10, "title": "The Constant Lover - Read by STL", "readers": [240], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/constantlover_0805_librivox/constantlover_suckling_stl_64kb.mp3", "duration": 49}]}
