{"title": "White Man's Burden", "description": "Rudyard Kipling was an English journalist, short-story writer, poet, and novelist.\nKipling was one of the most popular writers in the United Kingdom, in both prose and verse, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Henry James said: \"Kipling strikes me personally as the most complete man of genius (as distinct from fine intelligence) that I have ever known.\" In 1907, at the age of 42, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, making him the first English-language writer to receive the prize, and its youngest recipient to date. He was also sounded out for the British Poet Laureateship and on several occasions for a knighthood, both of which he declined. - Summary by Wikipedia", "duration": 1884, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "144", "name": "Rudyard Kipling"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/white_mans_burden_1607.poem_librivox/white_mans_burden_1607.jpg", "copyright_year": "1909", "genres": ["Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "The White Man's Burden - Read by 3D", "readers": [10967], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/white_mans_burden_1607.poem_librivox/burden_kipling_3d_64kb.mp3", "duration": 135}, {"section": 2, "title": "The White Man's Burden - Read by AK", "readers": [10898], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/white_mans_burden_1607.poem_librivox/burden_kipling_ak_64kb.mp3", "duration": 169}, {"section": 3, "title": "The White Man's Burden - Read by ALP", "readers": [4705], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/white_mans_burden_1607.poem_librivox/burden_kipling_alp_64kb.mp3", "duration": 159}, {"section": 4, "title": "The White Man's Burden - Read by BK", "readers": [8786], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/white_mans_burden_1607.poem_librivox/burden_kipling_bk_64kb.mp3", "duration": 195}, {"section": 5, "title": "The White Man's Burden - Read by DII", "readers": [4009], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/white_mans_burden_1607.poem_librivox/burden_kipling_dii_64kb.mp3", "duration": 151}, {"section": 6, "title": "The White Man's Burden - Read by EL", "readers": [9872], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/white_mans_burden_1607.poem_librivox/burden_kipling_el_64kb.mp3", "duration": 142}, {"section": 7, "title": "The White Man's Burden - Sung by EZWA", "readers": [123], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/white_mans_burden_1607.poem_librivox/burden_kipling_ezwa_64kb.mp3", "duration": 235}, {"section": 8, "title": "The White Man's Burden - Read by LLW", "readers": [4738], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/white_mans_burden_1607.poem_librivox/burden_kipling_llw_64kb.mp3", "duration": 178}, {"section": 9, "title": "The White Man's Burden - Read by MSD", "readers": [10891], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/white_mans_burden_1607.poem_librivox/burden_kipling_msd_64kb.mp3", "duration": 161}, {"section": 10, "title": "The White Man's Burden - Read by TA", "readers": [10289], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/white_mans_burden_1607.poem_librivox/burden_kipling_ta_64kb.mp3", "duration": 200}, {"section": 11, "title": "The White Man's Burden - Read by TP", "readers": [10789], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/white_mans_burden_1607.poem_librivox/burden_kipling_tp_64kb.mp3", "duration": 159}]}
