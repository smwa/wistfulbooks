{"title": "Jeremy At Crale; His Friends, His Ambitions And His One Great Enemy", "description": "This 1927 work is the third and final in Walpole\u2019s Jeremy series. (The others are Jeremy and Jeremy And Hamlet.) Jeremy\u2019s home is in Polchester, a fictional English cathedral town in Walpole\u2019s imagination. In this book Jeremy goes to boarding school. <br>\r\n\u201cJeremy at Crale [1927] has been my single attempt at a school-story. The genre is not an easy one for the very simple reason that a school-story can be only truly written by a boy who is still at school. It is all very well for us to say that we remember, but the things that we recall are for all of us the same things. There is the further difficulty that the sentiment of a boy's life is compounded of elements very dangerous and difficult for analysis\u2026. The fact is that boys are both little beasts and little heroes, that the age of puberty is the terror of parents and headmasters, and that no one dares to speak frankly, even in these frank days, of what everyone knows to be true. However, these are dangerous matters\u2026.\u201d (Walpole) - Summary by Hugh Walpole and david wales", "duration": 30641, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "3387", "name": "Hugh Walpole"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/jeremy_at_crale_2301_librivox/jeremyatcrale_2301.jpg", "copyright_year": "1927", "genres": ["Literary Fiction", "Published 1900 onward"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "David Wales"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "David Wales"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "DaveC"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "DaveC"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "The Fortress", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/jeremy_at_crale_2301_librivox/jeremyatcrale_01_walpole_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1775}, {"section": 2, "title": "House", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/jeremy_at_crale_2301_librivox/jeremyatcrale_02_walpole_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1632}, {"section": 3, "title": "The War Of The Sheep And The Goats (I) The Picture", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/jeremy_at_crale_2301_librivox/jeremyatcrale_03_walpole_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1941}, {"section": 4, "title": "Ridley", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/jeremy_at_crale_2301_librivox/jeremyatcrale_04_walpole_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1850}, {"section": 5, "title": "The Dormouse", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/jeremy_at_crale_2301_librivox/jeremyatcrale_05_walpole_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1899}, {"section": 6, "title": "The Game Against Raddan", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/jeremy_at_crale_2301_librivox/jeremyatcrale_06_walpole_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1856}, {"section": 7, "title": "The War Of The Sheep And The Goats (II) The Feast", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/jeremy_at_crale_2301_librivox/jeremyatcrale_07_walpole_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1878}, {"section": 8, "title": "Interlude: In Parlow's Rooms", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/jeremy_at_crale_2301_librivox/jeremyatcrale_08_walpole_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1666}, {"section": 9, "title": "Flight Of The Dormouse", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/jeremy_at_crale_2301_librivox/jeremyatcrale_09_walpole_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1745}, {"section": 10, "title": "Return Of The Dormouse", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/jeremy_at_crale_2301_librivox/jeremyatcrale_10_walpole_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1848}, {"section": 11, "title": "Dark Days", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/jeremy_at_crale_2301_librivox/jeremyatcrale_11_walpole_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1896}, {"section": 12, "title": "Visit Of Uncle Samuel", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/jeremy_at_crale_2301_librivox/jeremyatcrale_12_walpole_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1665}, {"section": 13, "title": "The Upper Ten - And The Lower Five", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/jeremy_at_crale_2301_librivox/jeremyatcrale_13_walpole_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1730}, {"section": 14, "title": "The War Of The Sheep And The Goats (III) The Fight", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/jeremy_at_crale_2301_librivox/jeremyatcrale_14_walpole_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1921}, {"section": 15, "title": "Life Begins To-Morrow?", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/jeremy_at_crale_2301_librivox/jeremyatcrale_15_walpole_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1797}, {"section": 16, "title": "The Match Against Callendar", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/jeremy_at_crale_2301_librivox/jeremyatcrale_16_walpole_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1929}, {"section": 17, "title": "Night-Piece: House-Supper", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/jeremy_at_crale_2301_librivox/jeremyatcrale_17_walpole_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1613}]}
