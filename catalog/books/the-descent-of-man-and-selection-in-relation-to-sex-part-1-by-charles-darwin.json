{"title": "Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex, Part 1", "description": "A book on evolutionary theory by English naturalist Charles Darwin, first published in 1871. It was Darwin's second great book on evolutionary theory, following his 1859 work, On The Origin of Species. In The Descent of Man, Darwin applies evolutionary theory to human evolution, and details his theory of sexual selection. The book discusses many related issues, including evolutionary psychology, evolutionary ethics, differences between human races, differences between sexes, the superiority of men to women, and the relevance of the evolutionary theory to society.(Summary by Wikipedia)\n<br><br>NOTE - In this audio version , many of Darwin's references to his sources have been omitted. People wishing to follow-up the references will find them all given in the text version.", "duration": 37011, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "166", "name": "Charles Darwin"}], "coverArt":
