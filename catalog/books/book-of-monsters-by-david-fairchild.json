{"title": "Book of Monsters", "description": "\u201cBook of Monsters\u201d by David and Marian Fairchild was published in 1914. Riveting descriptions of spiders and insects, from the perspective of both predator and prey, draw the reader into a world beyond the human perspective. Insightful accounts are given of body structures and behaviors employed by insects in their struggle to exist \u2013 a struggle which may conflict or align with that of the humans in their environment, and cause them to be viewed as enemy or ally. Additional enjoyment is provided by the explanation of innovative and elaborate photography techniques used to capture the images of the insects. - Summary by Jonathon Kirk", "duration": 13621, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "19349", "name": "David Fairchild"}, {"id": "19350", "name": "Marian Fairchild"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/bookofmonsters_2511_librivox/bookofmonsters_2511.jpg", "copyright_year": "1914", "genres": ["Animals", "Nature", "Life Sciences"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Jonathon Kirk"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Jonathon Kirk"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Christine Rottger"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Christine Rottger"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Introduction", "readers": [19969], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/bookofmonsters_2511_librivox/bookofmonsters_00_fairchild_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1093}, {"section": 1, "title": "Chapter 1 The Spider World", "readers": [19969], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/bookofmonsters_2511_librivox/bookofmonsters_01_fairchild_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1825}, {"section": 2, "title": "Chapter 2 The Insect World: Straight-Winged Insects", "readers": [19969], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/bookofmonsters_2511_librivox/bookofmonsters_02_fairchild_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1771}, {"section": 3, "title": "Chapter 2 The Insect World: The Order of Bugs", "readers": [19969], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/bookofmonsters_2511_librivox/bookofmonsters_03_fairchild_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1071}, {"section": 4, "title": "Chapter 2 The Insect World: The Beetles", "readers": [19969], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/bookofmonsters_2511_librivox/bookofmonsters_04_fairchild_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1836}, {"section": 5, "title": "Chapter 2 The Insect World: Two-Winged Insects", "readers": [19969], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/bookofmonsters_2511_librivox/bookofmonsters_05_fairchild_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1187}, {"section": 6, "title": "Chapter 2 The Insect World: Feathered Insects", "readers": [19969], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/bookofmonsters_2511_librivox/bookofmonsters_06_fairchild_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1259}, {"section": 7, "title": "Chapter 2 The Insect World: Nerve-Winged Insects", "readers": [19969], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/bookofmonsters_2511_librivox/bookofmonsters_07_fairchild_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1112}, {"section": 8, "title": "Chapter 2 The Insect World: The Stinging Insects", "readers": [19969], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/bookofmonsters_2511_librivox/bookofmonsters_08_fairchild_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2186}, {"section": 9, "title": "Chapter 3 The World of Myriapods and a Single Land Crustacean", "readers": [19969], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/bookofmonsters_2511_librivox/bookofmonsters_09_fairchild_64kb.mp3", "duration": 281}]}
