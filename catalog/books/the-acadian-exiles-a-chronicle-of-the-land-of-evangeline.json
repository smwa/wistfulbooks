{"title": "Chronicles of Canada Volume 09  - The Acadian Exiles: A Chronicle of the Land of Evangeline", "description": "The name Acadia, which we now associate with a great tragedy of history and song, was first used by the French to distinguish the eastern or maritime part of New France from the western part, which began with the St Lawrence valley and was called Canada. Just where Acadia ended and Canada began, the French never clearly defined. In course of time, as will be seen, this question became a cause of war with the English--but we shall not be much at fault if we take a line from the mouth of the river Penobscot, due north to the St Lawrence, to mark the western frontier of the Acadia of the French.<br /><br />\n\nThis volume covers the period of hostility between the Acadians and the British Crown.", "duration": 12956, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "4605", "name": " Arthur G.
