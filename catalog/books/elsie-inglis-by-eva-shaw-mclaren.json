{"title": "Elsie Inglis - The Woman With the Torch", "description": "This is a brief biography of the  Scottish physician and suffragist Dr. Elsie Inglis.  Dr. Inglis founded a maternity hospital  for the poor in Edinburgh (then known as the Hospice, but later as the Elsie Inglis Memorial Hospital), and was known for her charity and willingness to waive fees when patients could not afford her care. She was also a key figure in Scotland's Women's Suffrage Movement.  She is best known, however,  for founding the Scottish Women's Hospitals for Foreign Service, which provided staffed teams of female-staffed field hospitals to war zones during World War I. - Summary by Ciufi Galeazzi", "duration": 11606, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "14737", "name": "Eva Shaw McLaren"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/librivoxcdcoverart36/elsieinglis_2003.jpg", "copyright_year": "1920", "genres": ["Biography & Autobiography", "Modern (20th C)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Ciufi Galeazzi"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Ciufi Galeazzi"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "DaveC"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Lynette Caulkins"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Preface and Introduction", "readers": [11528], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/elsie_inglis_2003_librivox/elsieinglis_00_shawmclaren_64kb.mp3", "duration": 494}, {"section": 1, "title": "Elsie Inglis    Tributes from Various Sources- A Woman of Solved Problems", "readers": [11528], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/elsie_inglis_2003_librivox/elsieinglis_01_shawmclaren_64kb.mp3", "duration": 256}, {"section": 2, "title": "The Rock From Which She Was Hewn  Elsie Ingles the Central Figure on the Stage - Men and Women of the Past, The People of Her Race, Crowd Round Her - Their Influence on Her - Their Spirit Seen in Hers", "readers": [11528], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/elsie_inglis_2003_librivox/elsieinglis_02_shawmclaren_64kb.mp3", "duration": 551}, {"section": 3, "title": "1864-1894  Childhood in India-  Friendship With Her Father - Schooldays in Edinburgh - Death of Her Mother - Study of Medicine - Death of Her Father - Practice Started in Edinburgh in 1894 - Twenty Years of Professional Interests, Friendships - Varied Descriptions of Dr. Inglis by Miss S.E.S.
