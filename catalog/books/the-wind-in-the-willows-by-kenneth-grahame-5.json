{"title": "Wind in the Willows (Version 6)", "description": "The Wind in the Willows is a classic children's book--enjoyed by all ages!--by British novelist Kenneth Grahame, first published in 1908. Begun as letters to his 7-year-old son Alistair and later developed into a novel, it tells the adventures of animals Mole, Rat, and Toad, who dwell, along with Badger, Otter, and other animals, in the riverbank, fields, and woodlands of the English countryside. Best friends Mole and Rat, along with Badger, are continually rescuing Toad from his scrapes. An encounter with nature god Pan lends a special magic to this tale.<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn 2011, I recorded this delightful reading by my friend Sarbaga Falk. We made presents of the recordings for Sarbaga\u2019s family and our friends and their children and grandchildren; and had it in mind to put it on LibriVox. Shortly after we recorded Wind in the Willows, Sarbaga was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer\u2019s, which worsened until she passed away in February 2020.<br><br>\r\n\r\nSarbaga loved tales, jokes, and stories, and she would no doubt be tickled to listen to this wonderful tale told in her own inimitable and expressive voice. This stands as a fitting tribute to our dear friend, as she continues to delight us all.\r\n<br><br>\r\n - Summary by Cynthia Rylander Crossen", "duration": 23398, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "1222", "name": "Kenneth Grahame"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/windinthewillows_2109_librivox/wind_willows6_2109.jpg", "copyright_year": "1913", "genres": ["Action & Adventure", "Animals & Nature", "Family"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Sarbaga Falk"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "crcrossen"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "TriciaG"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Mozartjr"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "The River Bank", "readers": [16288], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/windinthewillows_2109_librivox/windinthewillows_01_grahame_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1652}, {"section": 2, "title": "The Open Road", "readers": [16288], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/windinthewillows_2109_librivox/windinthewillows_02_grahame_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1679}, {"section": 3, "title": "The Wild Wood", "readers": [16288], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/windinthewillows_2109_librivox/windinthewillows_03_grahame_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1727}, {"section": 4, "title": "Mr. Badger", "readers": [16288], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/windinthewillows_2109_librivox/windinthewillows_04_grahame_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1858}, {"section": 5, "title": "Dulce Domum", "readers": [16288], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/windinthewillows_2109_librivox/windinthewillows_05_grahame_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2122}, {"section": 6, "title": "Mr. Toad", "readers": [16288], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/windinthewillows_2109_librivox/windinthewillows_06_grahame_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1768}, {"section": 7, "title": "The Piper at the Gates of Dawn", "readers": [16288], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/windinthewillows_2109_librivox/windinthewillows_07_grahame_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1596}, {"section": 8, "title": "Toad's Adventures", "readers": [16288], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/windinthewillows_2109_librivox/windinthewillows_08_grahame_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1930}, {"section": 9, "title": "Wayfarers All", "readers": [16288], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/windinthewillows_2109_librivox/windinthewillows_09_grahame_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2505}, {"section": 10, "title": "The Further Adventures of Toad", "readers": [16288], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/windinthewillows_2109_librivox/windinthewillows_10_grahame_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2320}, {"section": 11, "title": "'Like Summer Tempests Came His Tears'", "readers": [16288], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/windinthewillows_2109_librivox/windinthewillows_11_grahame_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2344}, {"section": 12, "title": "The Return of Ulysses", "readers": [16288], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/windinthewillows_2109_librivox/windinthewillows_12_grahame_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1897}]}
