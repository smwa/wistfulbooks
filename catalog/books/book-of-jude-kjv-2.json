{"title": "Bible (KJV) NT 26: Jude", "description": "The Epistle of Jude is a brief book of only a single chapter with 25 verses. It is a general epistle, that is, a letter meant to be circulated and read in all the early Christian churches. Although brief, the content of the book is dense. Many examples of evildoers and strong warnings about their fates are given in rapid succession. The dispute over the body of Moses and the prophecies of Enoch are mentioned in no other book in the Bible. The doxology, or hymn of praise, at the end of the book is particularly beautiful.
