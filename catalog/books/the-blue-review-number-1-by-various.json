The successor to Rhythm, The Blue Review was edited by John Middleton Murry and Katherine Mansfield, but survived only three issues. In addition to poetry and short literary pieces, the review included reviews of theatre, music and the arts and of books recently published in English and French. The first issue of the journal includes the D. H. Lawrence short story, The Soiled Rose, which was later published as Shades of Spring. - Summary by Phil Benson", "duration": 10822, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "18", "name": " Various"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/blue_review_1_2107_librivox/bluereview1_2107.jpg", "copyright_year": "1913", "genres": ["Short Stories", "Literary Collections"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Phil Benson"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Phil Benson"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Annise"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Newgatenovelist"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "The Song of the Mad Prince by Walter de la Mare", "readers": [6097], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/blue_review_1_2107_librivox/bluereview1_01_various_64kb.mp3", "duration": 75}, {"section": 2, "title": "The Vixen by Wilfred Wilson Gibson", "readers": [6097], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/blue_review_1_2107_librivox/bluereview1_02_various_64kb.mp3", "duration": 205}, {"section": 3, "title": "To His Friend to Try Another Tavern by Oliver Gogarty", "readers": [6097], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/blue_review_1_2107_librivox/bluereview1_03_various_64kb.mp3", "duration": 126}, {"section": 4, "title": "The Soiled Rose by D.
