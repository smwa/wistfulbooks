{"title": "Story of a Modern Woman (Version 2)", "description": "\u201cThe Story of a Modern Woman\u201d (1894) is a work of feminist social realism. In its time it was one of the most famous and influential novels to grow out of and shape the \u201cNew Woman\u201d movement of the 1890s. It won such attention for its author that Ella Hepworth Dixon was given the nickname \u201cThe New Woman.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe story of the novel\u2019s protagonist, Mary Erle, loosely follows the outline of Dixon\u2019s own situation. As the well-educated daughter of a public intellectual, she enters the world of professional writing after his death, partly trading on his name. Victorian society had been distinctly patriarchal, and women were expected to find their places under the protection of men, traditionally defining themselves as wives and mothers. However, by the 1890s, an alarming \u201csurplus\u201d of unmarried women in Britain meant that many had statistically little chance of becoming anyone\u2019s wife or mother, and must create for themselves other paths to meaningful existence. This new reality demanded a more complex understanding of life, with storylines more nuanced than the old \u201cfind-a-husband\u201d fiction of earlier decades.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Story of a Modern Woman\u201d was published first in serial form, then released in the UK and the USA in two editions with some differences in the selection and arrangement of material. This LibriVox recording is based on the American edition. - Summary by Bruce Pirie", "duration": 26173, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "11225", "name": "Ella Hepworth Dixon"}], "coverArt":
