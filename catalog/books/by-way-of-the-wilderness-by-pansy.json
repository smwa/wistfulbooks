{"title": "By Way of the Wilderness", "description": "Wayne Pierson can\u2019t remember a time when his life was easy. Enemies in the form of a stepmother and stepbrother have come between Wayne and his father, and now he is without a home. His one ally is his Aunt Crete, but even she can't be told everything. Wayne can never forgive the people who made his life a misery. But with his heart so full of bitterness, can there ever be room in his heart for Christ - or for real, pure love?<br><br>\r\n\r\nSome people, it seems, must go through life \"by way of the wilderness\" - through the really difficult paths, until they learn their own inadequacy and the pride is subdued, so that they can finally embrace the God they so need.  - Summary by TriciaG<br><br>\r\n\r\nNOTE: The emotional abuse portrayed in the first few chapters of this story may be disturbing to regular listeners of Pansy.", "duration": 35276, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "1456", "name": "Mrs. C.
