{"title": "History of the Middle Ages", "description": "This overview of the 9th through the 13th centuries in Europe and the Middle East begins with the empire of Charles the Great, which extended the sway of Christendom. Munro writes that \"among the Saxons Charles found it necessary to forbid human sacrifice and the eating of the bodies of witches.\" In the century after Charles's death his empire was divided and invasions of Saracens, Slavs, Hungarians and, above all, Vikings strengthened the hold of feudal localism as people were compelled to seek the protection of the nearest strongman. Despite these challenges, the Capetians established a successful dynasty in what would become France. English institutions developed under Anglo-Saxon, Norman, and Plantagenet kings. The German Emperors encountered the resourceful Italian city-states and challenged the popes. The Moslem world rose and threatened Constantinople and western crusaders invaded eastern lands. Nor in his survey of the martial and political landscape, does Professor Munro neglect the monastic orders, the new universities, and the daily lives of the people, both high and low.
