{"title": "Feminism in Greek Literature", "description": "This study, published in 1923, examines the views regarding women's place in Ancient Greek society based especially on the writings of Homer, Euripides, Aristophanes, Plato, Socrates and Aristotle. As the author offers his opinion and judgement, that at times reflect views on women, homosexuality and other social groups and themes that might be considered controversial now, he leaves an interesting picture of the state of Classical scholarship in the early 20th century.<br>\n\n\"There is a question sometimes put to scholars, a doubt often latent in scholars' minds \u2014 How was it that Greek civilisation, with all its high ideals and achievements, fell so easily before what seems at first sight an altogether inferior culture? The fact is \u2014 and it is as well to state it plainly \u2014 that the Greek world perished from one main cause, a low ideal of womanhood and a degradation of women which found expression both in literature and in social life. The position of women and the position of slaves \u2014 for the two classes went together \u2014 were the canker-spots which, left unhealed, brought about the decay first of Athens and then of Greece.\" (From Introduction) ", "duration": 19749, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "13940", "name": "Frederick Adam Wright"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/librivoxcCDCoverArt35/feminismgreeklit_1905.jpg", "copyright_year": "1923", "genres": ["Social Science (Culture & Anthropology)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Beth Thomas (1974-2020)"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "ToddHW"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Leni"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Introduction", "readers": [6281], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/feminismingreekliterature_1905_librivox/feminismingreekliterature_00_wright_64kb.mp3", "duration": 403}, {"section": 1, "title": "The Early Epic", "readers": [12864], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/feminismingreekliterature_1905_librivox/feminismingreekliterature_01_wright_64kb.mp3", "duration": 730}, {"section": 2, "title": "The Ionians and Hesiod", "readers": [12864], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/feminismingreekliterature_1905_librivox/feminismingreekliterature_02_wright_64kb.mp3", "duration": 965}, {"section": 3, "title": "The Lyric Poets", "readers": [13030], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/feminismingreekliterature_1905_librivox/feminismingreekliterature_03_wright_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1375}, {"section": 4, "title": "The Milesian Tales", "readers": [12864], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/feminismingreekliterature_1905_librivox/feminismingreekliterature_04_wright_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1206}, {"section": 5, "title": "Athens in the Fifth Century", "readers": [10995], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/feminismingreekliterature_1905_librivox/feminismingreekliterature_05_wright_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1206}, {"section": 6, "title": "Aeschylus and Sophocles", "readers": [12864], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/feminismingreekliterature_1905_librivox/feminismingreekliterature_06_wright_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1326}, {"section": 7, "title": "Euripides", "readers": [12864], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/feminismingreekliterature_1905_librivox/feminismingreekliterature_07_wright_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2272}, {"section": 8, "title": "Euripides: The Four Feminist Plays", "readers": [6281], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/feminismingreekliterature_1905_librivox/feminismingreekliterature_08_wright_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1719}, {"section": 9, "title": "The Socratic Circle", "readers": [13030], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/feminismingreekliterature_1905_librivox/feminismingreekliterature_09_wright_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1283}, {"section": 10, "title": "Aristophanes", "readers": [13030], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/feminismingreekliterature_1905_librivox/feminismingreekliterature_10_wright_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1552}, {"section": 11, "title": "Plato", "readers": [11528], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/feminismingreekliterature_1905_librivox/feminismingreekliterature_11_wright_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1343}, {"section": 12, "title": "The Attic Orators", "readers": [12864], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/feminismingreekliterature_1905_librivox/feminismingreekliterature_12_wright_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1606}, {"section": 13, "title": "Aristotle", "readers": [7832], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/feminismingreekliterature_1905_librivox/feminismingreekliterature_13_wright_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2763}]}
