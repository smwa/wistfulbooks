{"title": "St. George and St. Michael, Volume 3", "description": "\u2019St. George and St. Michael\u2019 is a little-known historical romance telling the story of a young couple who find themselves on opposing sides during the tumultuous years of the English Civil Wars. Volume 3 completes the series. \n\nTensions are rising between king and parliament, the Church of England and the numerous independent puritans, and rumours abound that Charles I will soon declare open war on the dissident elements within his realm. Seventeen-year-old Dorothy Vaughan knows little of the brewing conflict, yet is sure that her loyalty must be with her king and her nation. When she challenges her childhood friend, Richard Heywood, to prove himself a man and so worthy of winning her hand in marriage by becoming involved in the larger events that surround them, he finds that his convictions \u2013 both political and spiritual \u2013 lie with his father\u2019s and the puritans. Determined to do what he believes is right, Richard finds that he cannot shake his immovable conscience, even for the woman he loves.\n\nThough it is, for the most part, a realistic novel, \u2018St. George and St. Michael\u2019 is not without either the otherwordly atmosphere of the fantastic or the rich spiritual depth that characterizes so much of MacDonald\u2019s writing. - Summary by Jordan", "duration": 21376, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "631", "name": "George MacDonald"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/stgeorge_stmichael3_2020_librivox/SGM3_2005.jpg", "copyright_year": "1876", "genres": ["Historical Fiction", "Romance", "Published 1800 -1900"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Linette Geisel"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Amy Gramour"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Linette Geisel"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Chapter 39 - Newbury.", "readers": [13278], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/stgeorge_stmichael3_2020_librivox/stgeorgeandstmichael3_01_macdonald_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1269}, {"section": 2, "title": "Chapter 40 \u2013 Dorothy and Rowland.", "readers": [12734], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/stgeorge_stmichael3_2020_librivox/stgeorgeandstmichael3_02_macdonald_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1122}, {"section": 3, "title": "Chapter 41 \u2013 Glamorgan.", "readers": [12734], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/stgeorge_stmichael3_2020_librivox/stgeorgeandstmichael3_03_macdonald_64kb.mp3", "duration": 693}, {"section": 4, "title": "Chapter 42 - A New Soldier.", "readers": [12734], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/stgeorge_stmichael3_2020_librivox/stgeorgeandstmichael3_04_macdonald_64kb.mp3", "duration": 807}, {"section": 5, "title": "Chapter 43 \u2013 Lady and Bishop.", "readers": [13760], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/stgeorge_stmichael3_2020_librivox/stgeorgeandstmichael3_05_macdonald_64kb.mp3", "duration": 623}, {"section": 6, "title": "Chapter 44 - The King.", "readers": [12734], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/stgeorge_stmichael3_2020_librivox/stgeorgeandstmichael3_06_macdonald_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1892}, {"section": 7, "title": "Chapter 45 \u2013 The Secret Interview.", "readers": [10261], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/stgeorge_stmichael3_2020_librivox/stgeorgeandstmichael3_07_macdonald_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1152}, {"section": 8, "title": "Chapter 46 \u2013 Gifts of Healing.", "readers": [10261], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/stgeorge_stmichael3_2020_librivox/stgeorgeandstmichael3_08_macdonald_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1134}, {"section": 9, "title": "Chapter 47 \u2013 The Poet-Physician.", "readers": [10261], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/stgeorge_stmichael3_2020_librivox/stgeorgeandstmichael3_09_macdonald_64kb.mp3", "duration": 839}, {"section": 10, "title": "Chapter 48 \u2013 Honorable Disgrace.", "readers": [12734], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/stgeorge_stmichael3_2020_librivox/stgeorgeandstmichael3_10_macdonald_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1462}, {"section": 11, "title": "Chapter 49 - Siege.", "readers": [12734], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/stgeorge_stmichael3_2020_librivox/stgeorgeandstmichael3_11_macdonald_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1431}, {"section": 12, "title": "Chapter 50 - A Sally.", "readers": [12734], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/stgeorge_stmichael3_2020_librivox/stgeorgeandstmichael3_12_macdonald_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1357}, {"section": 13, "title": "Chapter 51 \u2013 Under the Moat.", "readers": [10995], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/stgeorge_stmichael3_2020_librivox/stgeorgeandstmichael3_13_macdonald_64kb.mp3", "duration": 841}, {"section": 14, "title": "Chapter 52 \u2013 The Untoothsome Plum.", "readers": [10995], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/stgeorge_stmichael3_2020_librivox/stgeorgeandstmichael3_14_macdonald_64kb.mp3", "duration": 686}, {"section": 15, "title": "Chapter 53 \u2013 Faithful Foes.", "readers": [12734], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/stgeorge_stmichael3_2020_librivox/stgeorgeandstmichael3_15_macdonald_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1175}, {"section": 16, "title": "Chapter 54 \u2013 Domus Dissolvitur.", "readers": [12734], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/stgeorge_stmichael3_2020_librivox/stgeorgeandstmichael3_16_macdonald_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1355}, {"section": 17, "title": "Chapter 55 - R.
