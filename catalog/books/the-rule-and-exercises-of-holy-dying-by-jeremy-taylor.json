{"title": "Rule and Exercises of Holy Dying", "description": "Written by a Church of England clergyman in the time of Cromwell, this work is praised for both its style and content. Taylor's work was much admired by John Wesley, the founder of Methodism, for its devotional quality; and by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Thomas de Quincey, and Edmund Gosse for its literary qualities.<br /><br /><i>Holy Dying</i> is meant to instruct the reader in the \"means and instruments\" of preparing for a blessed death, written in a time when death was a constant companion to life and not to be encountered without being ready for it. It assumes illness and a death-bed, with recommended meditations and prayers for the sick, the family, and the clergyman attending to the dying one.
