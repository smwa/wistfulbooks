{"title": "Improvement of Human Reason", "description": "The story revolves around \u1e24ayy ibn Yaq\u1e93\u0101n, a little boy who grew up on an island in the Indies under the equator, isolated from the people, in the bosom of an antelope that raised him, feeding him with her milk. \u1e24ayy has just learned to walk and imitates the sounds of antelopes, birds, and other animals in his surroundings. He learns their languages, and he learns to follow the actions of animals by imitating their instinct.\r\nHe makes his own shoes and clothes from the skins of animals, and studies the stars. He reaches a higher level of knowledge, of the finest of astrologists. His continuous explorations and observation of creatures and the environment lead him to gain great knowledge in natural science, philosophy, and religion. He concludes that, at the basis of the creation of the universe, a great creator must exist. \u1e24ayy ibn Yaq\u1e93\u0101n lived a humble modest life as Sufi and forbade himself from eating meat.\r\nOnce 30 years old, he meets his first human, who has landed on his isolated island. By the age of 49, he is ready to teach other people about the knowledge he gained throughout his life.  - Summary by Wikipedia", "duration": 11485, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "17673", "name": "Muhammad ibn 'Abd al-Malik Ibn Tufail"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/improvement_human_reason_2308_librivox/improvement_human_reason_2309.jpg", "copyright_year": "1708", "genres": ["Culture & Heritage Fiction"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Peter Tucker"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Peter Tucker"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Annise"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Newgatenovelist"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Introduction to the Life of Hai Ebn Yokdhan", "readers": [8799], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/improvement_human_reason_2308_librivox/improvementofhumanreason_01_ibntufayl_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1304}, {"section": 2, "title": "History of Hai Ebn Yokdhan ss.1-13", "readers": [8799], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/improvement_human_reason_2308_librivox/improvementofhumanreason_02_ibntufayl_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1129}, {"section": 3, "title": "History of Hai Ebn Yokdhan ss.14-26", "readers": [8799], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/improvement_human_reason_2308_librivox/improvementofhumanreason_03_ibntufayl_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1088}, {"section": 4, "title": "History of Hai Ebn Yokdhan ss. 27-42", "readers": [8799], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/improvement_human_reason_2308_librivox/improvementofhumanreason_04_ibntufayl_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1146}, {"section": 5, "title": "History of Hai Ebn Yokdhan ss. 43-54", "readers": [8799], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/improvement_human_reason_2308_librivox/improvementofhumanreason_05_ibntufayl_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1193}, {"section": 6, "title": "History of Hai Ebn Yokdhan ss. 55-66", "readers": [8799], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/improvement_human_reason_2308_librivox/improvementofhumanreason_06_ibntufayl_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1175}, {"section": 7, "title": "History of Hai Ebn Yokdhan ss. 67-78", "readers": [8799], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/improvement_human_reason_2308_librivox/improvementofhumanreason_07_ibntufayl_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1169}, {"section": 8, "title": "History of Hai Ebn Yokdhan ss. 79-91", "readers": [8799], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/improvement_human_reason_2308_librivox/improvementofhumanreason_08_ibntufayl_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1109}, {"section": 9, "title": "History of Hai Ebn Yokdhan ss. 92-106", "readers": [8799], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/improvement_human_reason_2308_librivox/improvementofhumanreason_09_ibntufayl_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1045}, {"section": 10, "title": "History of Hai Ebn Yokdhan ss. 107-120", "readers": [8799], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/improvement_human_reason_2308_librivox/improvementofhumanreason_10_ibntufayl_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1127}]}
