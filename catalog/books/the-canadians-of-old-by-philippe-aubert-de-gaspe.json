{"title": "Canadians of Old", "description": "In his mid-70s, Philippe Aubert de Gasp\u00e9 took on the project of recording the culture and heritage of French Canada, especially that of the late 1700s, the world of his youth. The result, published in French in 1863, was the historical fiction \"Les Anciens Canadiens (literally, \u201cThe Canadians of Old\u201d).<br /><br />\n\nIn this book, inspired by the historical novels of Sir Walter Scott, Aubert de Gasp\u00e9 collects the customs, traditions, folk tales, superstitions, and songs of the Quebec people, weaves in memories of life in his own ancestral home, and sets all this within the momentous historical events that transformed Canada in the 18th century. Much of the book is historically accurate, based sometimes on the author\u2019s own experiences and sometimes on memories passed on to him by eyewitnesses. <br /><br />\n\nFor example, the account of being sent to debtor\u2019s prison came from the author\u2019s own experience. <br /><br />\n\nThe fantastic ghost story of \u201cLa Corriveau\u201d was based on the true story of a murderess whose body was on public display in iron chains (a \u201ccage\u201d) for weeks after her execution. That initial incident had already blossomed into material for lurid legend; Aubert de Gasp\u00e9 was the first to incorporate this legend into a work of literature.<br /><br />\n\nThe book\u2019s storyline hinges on the British Conquest of Quebec in 1759 and the ensuing trauma caused to French Canada. Fictional characters are intertwined with historical figures such as a famous shipwreck survivor and specific military officers.<br /><br />\n\nThis book is an engaging window on cultural history and one of the first great works of French Canadian literature.<br /><br />\n\nThe English translator of this edition, Charles G. D. Roberts, was himself a distinguished author. He has been called \u201cthe father of Canadian poetry.\u201d - Summary by Bruce Pirie<br /><br />\n*Warning: Listeners may be offended by some of the racial labels and depictions.
