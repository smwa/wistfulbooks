{"title": "North Lancashire", "description": "Cambridge County Geographies was a 75 volume series covering the counties of England, Scotland and Wales. Separate volumes were produced for Lancashire north and south of the River Ribble. J. E. Marr's volume on North Lancashire covers a geographically diverse region, including Furness and the Lake District west of Lake Windermere that now spans Lancashire and Cumbria. As much a history, guidebook and gazetteer as it is a geography, Marr's volume paints a rich and in places idyllic picture of the northern parts of the county in the years before the first world war. - Summary by Phil Benson", "duration": 13045, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "13378", "name": "John Edward Marr"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/north_lancashire_1805_librivox/north_lancashire_1805.jpg", "copyright_year": "1912", "genres": ["Travel & Geography"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Phil Benson"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Phil Benson"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Annise"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Newgatenovelist"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Chapters 1-5", "readers": [6097], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/north_lancashire_1805_librivox/northlancashire_01_marr_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2069}, {"section": 2, "title": "Chapters 6-10", "readers": [6097], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/north_lancashire_1805_librivox/northlancashire_02_marr_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2206}, {"section": 3, "title": "Chapters 11-14", "readers": [6097], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/north_lancashire_1805_librivox/northlancashire_03_marr_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2555}, {"section": 4, "title": "Chapters 15-19", "readers": [6097], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/north_lancashire_1805_librivox/northlancashire_04_marr_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2185}, {"section": 5, "title": "Chapters 20-25", "readers": [6097], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/north_lancashire_1805_librivox/northlancashire_05_marr_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2295}, {"section": 6, "title": "Chapters 26-27", "readers": [6097], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/north_lancashire_1805_librivox/northlancashire_06_marr_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1735}]}
