{"title": "Ginx's Baby: His Birth and Other Misfortunes", "description": "In the second half of the 19th century, London was becoming a wealthy, industrialized city. It attracted many working class people from nearby towns and rural areas, all hoping to improve their lives and the futures of their family. But this growing population led to stiff competition for jobs, and the wealthy business owners didn't need to offer fair wages to get or keep workers, resulting in rampant poverty, overcrowding, and unsanitary slums. Many emigrated from Britian during this time, but for others things remained very desperate. This \"light\", satirical novel deals with what Ginx, one such poor man, did with the baby he could not afford to keep, and then what Charity and the Churches did with Ginx's Baby, what the Parish did with him, what the Clubs and Politicians did with him, and ultimately, what Ginx's Baby did with himself. - Summary by Lisa Reichert", "duration": 12633, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "17492", "name": "Edward Jenkins"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/ginxsbabyhisbirth_2406_librivox/ginxsbaby_2406.jpg", "copyright_year": "1870", "genres": ["General Fiction", "Historical Fiction", "Satire"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Lisa Reichert"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Lisa Reichert"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "DaveC"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Christine Rottger"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "PREFACE & PART I.
