{"title": "Jumping Kangaroo and the Apple Butter Cat", "description": "A classic children's story involving all kinds of animals who have adventures, competition and are always interested in food! Sometimes some animals don't get along very well, but at other times, they can become the best of friends and really help each other! Just like real children, they compete, argue a little, help each other, play and have fun. Usually there is always something to be learned as we explore together this unique animal world.
