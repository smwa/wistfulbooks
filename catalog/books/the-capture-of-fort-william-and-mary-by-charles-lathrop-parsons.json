{"title": "Capture of Fort William and Mary", "description": "The Capture of Fort William and Mary took place in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, on December 14, 1774, when local Patriots led by John Langdon stormed Fort William and Mary guarding the mouth of the busy seaport. They overcame a six-man caretaker detachment and seized the garrison's powder, which was distributed through several towns in the colony for potential use in the looming struggle against Great Britain. On December 15, 1774, patriots led by John Sullivan again raided the fort, this time seizing numerous cannons, later used in the pivotal Battle of Bunker Hill.  The incident is significant as one of the first overt acts of the American Revolutionary War and the only battle to take place in the state of New Hampshire. - Summary by Wikipeda", "duration": 4181, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "18147", "name": "Charles Lathrop Parsons"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/capturefortwilliammary_2406_librivox/capturefortwilliamandmary_2406.jpg", "copyright_year": "1903", "genres": ["War & Military", "Early Modern"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Robert Morel"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Robert Morel"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Ann Boulais"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "afutterer"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "The Capture of Fort William and Mary, December 14th and 15th, 1774", "readers": [17597], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/capturefortwilliammary_2406_librivox/captureoffortwilliamandmary_01_parsons_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2363}, {"section": 2, "title": "The Disposal of The Powder", "readers": [17597], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/capturefortwilliammary_2406_librivox/captureoffortwilliamandmary_02_parsons_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1045}, {"section": 3, "title": "The Participants", "readers": [17597], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/capturefortwilliammary_2406_librivox/captureoffortwilliamandmary_03_parsons_64kb.mp3", "duration": 300}, {"section": 4, "title": "The Powder at Bunker Hill", "readers": [17597], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/capturefortwilliammary_2406_librivox/captureoffortwilliamandmary_04_parsons_64kb.mp3", "duration": 250}, {"section": 5, "title": "Was the Capture of Fort William and Mary the First Overt Act of the Revolution?", "readers": [17597], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/capturefortwilliammary_2406_librivox/captureoffortwilliamandmary_05_parsons_64kb.mp3", "duration": 223}]}
