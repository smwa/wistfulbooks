{"title": "Tales of 1928: A Selection of Folktales, Fables, and Legends from Books Published in 1928", "description": "This anthology of folktales, fables, and legends has been selected from twenty different books published in 1928, covering a range of European stories (ancient and modern) along with stories from the Middle East, Asia, Africa, and the Americas.
