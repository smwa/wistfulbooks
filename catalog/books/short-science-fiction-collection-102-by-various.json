{"title": "Short Science Fiction Collection 102", "description": "Science fiction is a genre encompassing imaginative works that take place in this world or that of the author\u2019s creation where anything is possible. The only rules are those set forth by the author. The speculative nature of the genre inspires thought and plants seeds that have led to advances in science. The genre can spark an interest in the sciences and is cited as the impetus for the career choice of many scientists. It is a playing field to explore social perspectives, predictions of the future, and engage in adventures unbound into the richness of the human mind. - Summary by A.
