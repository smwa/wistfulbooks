He was a close friend of Walter de la Mare from 1907, who lobbied hard with Edward Marsh to get Freeman into the Georgian Poetry series; with eventual success. De la Mare's biographer Theresa Whistler describes him as \"tall, gangling, ugly, solemn, punctilious\". \nThis poem is taken from POEMS NEW AND OLD By John Freeman  (1920) - Summary by David Lawrence", "duration": 1452, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "2354", "name": "John Frederick Freeman"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/once_therewas_time_2102.poem_librivox/oncetherewastime_2103.jpg", "copyright_year": "1920", "genres": ["Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "David Lawrence"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Once There Was Time - Read by AG", "readers": [14540], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/once_therewas_time_2102.poem_librivox/time_freeman_ag_64kb.mp3", "duration": 66}, {"section": 2, "title": "Once There Was Time - Read by AK", "readers": [15822], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/once_therewas_time_2102.poem_librivox/time_freeman_ak_64kb.mp3", "duration": 73}, {"section": 3, "title": "Once There Was Time - Read by APS", "readers": [13577], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/once_therewas_time_2102.poem_librivox/time_freeman_aps_64kb.mp3", "duration": 80}, {"section": 4, "title": "Once There Was Time - Read by BK", "readers": [8786], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/once_therewas_time_2102.poem_librivox/time_freeman_bk_64kb.mp3", "duration": 91}, {"section": 5, "title": "Once There Was Time - Read by CB", "readers": [9862], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/once_therewas_time_2102.poem_librivox/time_freeman_cb_64kb.mp3", "duration": 67}, {"section": 6, "title": "Once There Was Time - Read by CJPH", "readers": [12752], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/once_therewas_time_2102.poem_librivox/time_freeman_cjph_64kb.mp3", "duration": 71}, {"section": 7, "title": "Once There Was Time - Read by EL0", "readers": [9872], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/once_therewas_time_2102.poem_librivox/time_freeman_el0_64kb.mp3", "duration": 113}, {"section": 8, "title": "Once There Was Time - Read by FLT", "readers": [12950], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/once_therewas_time_2102.poem_librivox/time_freeman_flt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 78}, {"section": 9, "title": "Once There Was Time - Read by FS", "readers": [6735], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/once_therewas_time_2102.poem_librivox/time_freeman_fs_64kb.mp3", "duration": 80}, {"section": 10, "title": "Once There Was Time - Read by GG", "readers": [8011], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/once_therewas_time_2102.poem_librivox/time_freeman_gg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 87}, {"section": 11, "title": "Once There Was Time - Read by GRS", "readers": [12484], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/once_therewas_time_2102.poem_librivox/time_freeman_grs_64kb.mp3", "duration": 86}, {"section": 12, "title": "Once There Was Time - Read by LAH", "readers": [1212], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/once_therewas_time_2102.poem_librivox/time_freeman_lah_64kb.mp3", "duration": 85}, {"section": 13, "title": "Once There Was Time - Read by LCW", "readers": [8425], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/once_therewas_time_2102.poem_librivox/time_freeman_lcw_64kb.mp3", "duration": 81}, {"section": 14, "title": "Once There Was Time - Read by LS", "readers": [15365], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/once_therewas_time_2102.poem_librivox/time_freeman_ls_64kb.mp3", "duration": 80}, {"section": 15, "title": "Once There Was Time - Read by NRA", "readers": [15781], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/once_therewas_time_2102.poem_librivox/time_freeman_nra_64kb.mp3", "duration": 88}, {"section": 16, "title": "Once There Was Time - Read by PS", "readers": [8576], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/once_therewas_time_2102.poem_librivox/time_freeman_ps_64kb.mp3", "duration": 80}, {"section": 17, "title": "Once There Was Time - Read by R", "readers": [6924], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/once_therewas_time_2102.poem_librivox/time_freeman_r_64kb.mp3", "duration": 75}, {"section": 18, "title": "Once There Was Time - Read by TM", "readers": [13005], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/once_therewas_time_2102.poem_librivox/time_freeman_tm_64kb.mp3", "duration": 71}]}
