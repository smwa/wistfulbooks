{"title": "Jack-Knife Man", "description": "A lighthearted tale which revolves around old Peter Lane, who lives in a houseboat on the Mississippi River and mostly whiles away his time whittling with his jack-knife and not really doing much else. That is, until one night, a sickly woman knocks at his boat door holding her son in her arms. This encounter would change Peter's life, as the old man befriends little Buddy and is determined to keep him and raise him as his own, provided he is able to keep a host of others from laying claim to the orphan.\n<br /><br />\n(Note - While the online text for this book appears that there is no chapter 7, no chapters have been omitted from this recording.) - Summary by Roger Melin", "duration": 20787, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "53", "name": "Ellis Parker Butler"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/jackknifeman_1801_librivox/jack_knife_man_1801.jpg", "copyright_year": "1913", "genres": ["Published 1900 onward"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Roger Melin"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Roger Melin"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Bev J Stevens"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Helen Z.
