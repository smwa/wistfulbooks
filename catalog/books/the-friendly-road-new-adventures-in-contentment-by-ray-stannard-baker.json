{"title": "Friendly Road, New Adventures in Contentment", "description": "My grandmother Gertrude received a copy of The Friendly Road for Christmas in 1919. It must have been a special gift book--green leather binding, gold embossing, a sheet of tissue paper protecting the color plate facing the title page--this a painting of a solitary man enjoying a swim in a sun dappled stream with the caption \"Surely it is good to be alive at a time like this.\"<br><br>\n\nWritten in first person, pseudo autobiographical style, the \u201cauthor\u201d of The Friendly Road, David Grayson, is a writer,* living on a farm with cows to milk, and ducks and pigs to feed, and fields in need of plowing. One day he just slings a few belongings in a pack and walks off, leaving the cows unmilked and his sister Harriet standing in the doorway. <i>\"My sober friend</i>Grayson writes, <i>\"have you ever tried to do anything that the world at large considers not quite sensible, not quite sane? Try it!\"</i> The rest of the book is an odd mixture of nostalgia for a gentler, kinder age; adventures, as Grayson relies on the charity of strangers to get by; with a bit of progressive politics thrown in. After bumming for several days, Grayson arrives in the \"City,\" where a strike is in progress. He sympathizes with the workers, but he is appalled by <i>\"the ill-smelling streets and dirty sidewalks and swarming human beings . . . the evidences of poverty, dirt, and ignorance.\"</i> And guess what? He returns home to his farm, and Harriet bakes him a rhubarb pie.<br><br>\n\nGertrude, who had immigrated from Germany to the United States in 1892 at the age of 17, was 44 years old that Christmas. She was living on a fruit ranch in western Washington state, with her husband, a school teacher, also a German immigrant, whom she had married in 1898. She had 6 children, the oldest 20, the youngest only 2. The last few years had not been easy for this family. Gertrude's 10-year old daughter Mary, my mother, was slowly limping towards recovery from a bout of polio. Worse yet, during World War I Gertrude's husband was unjustly accused of being a \"German sympathizer\" despite the fact that his oldest son was a U.S. Army volunteer, and he was forced from his teaching post. His job loss meant more work for Gertrude, because, as my grandfather later explained to a journalist, after losing his job, he decided to \u201cretire\u201d to the country--<i>\"to live calmly, read Homer and Goethe and Balzac and Emerson (and) raise fruit and chickens.\"**</i><br><br>\n\nGertrude entrusted several of her favorite books to my teenage self before she died in 1958. Another was a book of poems entitled Because I Love You, inscribed to Gertrude as a birthday present in 1897 by a young man who was not my grandfather!
