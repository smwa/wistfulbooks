{"title": "Green Goddess, a play in four acts", "description": "British Major Crespin, his wife Lucilla and their pilot, Dr. Traherne, survive a forced landing of their aircraft in the remote Himalayan kingdom of Rukh. Crespin blames Traherne for alienation of his wife's affection, a charge which Lucilla vehemently denies, though she does have feelings for Traherne as does he for her. But now another man enters the picture, for the Raja of Rukh intends to make Lucilla his own.\r\n\r\nThe play opened in December, 1920 and was so successful that it was adapted (1922) as a novel of the same name by Louise Jordan Miln who credited the playwright, William Archer, as her co-author. The story was also produced in two films: a silent one (1923) and a \"talkie\" (1930). The actor George Arliss starred as the Raja in both films as well as in the original cast for the play. It is said that the executive chef of the Palace Hotel in San Francisco so admired Mr. Arliss' work that he concocted (1923) \"Green Goddess\" dressing in tribute. - Summary by Brian Fullen\r\n\r\nCast List:\r\n\r\nThe Raja of Rukh: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/19399\"> tombooker</a>\r\nWatkins, his valet: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/17576\"> Beeswaxcandle</a>\r\nMajor Antony Crespin: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/17713\"> Brian Fullen</a>\r\nLucilla, his wife: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/13140\"> Jenn Broda</a>\r\nDoctor Basil Traherne: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/19584\"> ShrimpPhish</a>\r\nLieutenant Denis Cardew: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/7170\"> Alan Mapstone</a>\r\nThe Priest: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/6924\"> Rapunzelina</a>\r\nStage Directions: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/6754\"> ToddHW</a>\r\nEditing: <a href=\"https://librivox.org/reader/17713\">Brian Fullen</a><br>", "duration": 11053, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "6851", "name": " William Archer"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/greengoddess_2510_librivox/green_godess_2510.jpg", "copyright_year": "1921", "genres": ["Romance"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Brian Fullen"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Rapunzelina"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Act 1", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/greengoddess_2510_librivox/greengoddess_1_archer_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2248}, {"section": 2, "title": "Act 2", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/greengoddess_2510_librivox/greengoddess_2_archer_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3397}, {"section": 3, "title": "Act 3", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/greengoddess_2510_librivox/greengoddess_3_archer_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3232}, {"section": 4, "title": "Act 4", "readers": [], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/greengoddess_2510_librivox/greengoddess_4_archer_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2176}]}
