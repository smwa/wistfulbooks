{"title": "Unknown Masterpiece", "description": "\u201cThe Unknown Masterpiece\u201d (\u201cLe Chef-d\u2019\u0153uvre inconnu\u201d) is a novella by Honor\u00e9 de Balzac, published with revisions in 1845, after earlier versions in 1831 and 1837. \r\n\r\n\u201cThe Unknown Masterpiece\u201d grapples with questions of real life vs. artistic representations of life, and artist\u2019s intentions vs. audience reception. We follow a discussion between three artists in the early 1600s. Two of these artists are based on historical figures \u2014 Nicolas Poussin and Frans Pourbus (Porbus) the Younger. The third is a fictional creation \u2014 \u201cMaster Frenhofer,\u201d a genius painter who has been struggling for years to complete his masterpiece. \r\n\r\nFrenhofer is full of ideas \u2014 perhaps too full. He discourses passionately about art and representation, but Balzac the realist was himself distrustful of this intellectualization of artistic processes, and wrote that this story \u201cshows the disorder that thought in all its development produces in the artist\u2019s soul.\u201d  \r\n\r\nBalzac might have been astonished to learn that the very discourse of which he was so suspicious would become, a century later, a fetish among leading artists. Paul C\u00e9zanne declared, \u201cFrenhofer, c\u2019est moi!\u201d Picasso was commissioned to illustrate a centenary edition of the story, and was so taken with its ideas \u2014 \u201chaunted\u201d by Balzac, as he said \u2014 that he made a point of taking up residence in the Parisian street that is the setting for the story. It was in this studio that he created his giant masterpiece \u201cGuernica.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Unknown Masterpiece\u201d is today recognized as a seminal document in the history of ideas about modern art. - Summary by Bruce Pirie", "duration": 5170, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "86", "name": "Honor\u00e9 de Balzac"}], "coverArt": null, "copyright_year": "1899", "genres": ["Literary Fiction", "Published 1800 -1900"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Bruce Pirie"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Bruce Pirie"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Barry Eads"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Winnifred Assmann"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Gillette", "readers": [3699], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/unknownmasterpiece_2410_librivox/unknownmasterpiece_01_balzac_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3519}, {"section": 2, "title": "Catherine Lescault", "readers": [3699], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/unknownmasterpiece_2410_librivox/unknownmasterpiece_02_balzac_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1651}]}
