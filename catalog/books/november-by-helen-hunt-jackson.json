{"title": "November", "description": "Helen Maria Hunt Jackson, born Helen Fiske was an American poet and writer who became an activist on behalf of improved treatment of Native Americans by the U.S. government. She described the adverse effects of government actions in her history A Century of Dishonor (1881). Her novel Ramona* (1884) dramatized the federal government's mistreatment of Native Americans in Southern California after the Mexican\u2013American War and attracted considerable attention to her cause. Commercially popular, it was estimated to have been reprinted 300 times and most readers liked its romantic and picturesque qualities rather than its political content. The novel was so popular that it attracted many tourists to Southern California who wanted to see places from the book. (Wikipedia) <br /><br />\n* LibriVox has two versions of Ramona in the catalog.", "duration": 946, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "72", "name": "Helen Hunt Jackson"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/november_1511.poem_librivox/november_1511.jpg", "copyright_year": "0", "genres": ["Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "November - Read by ABB", "readers": [10442], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/november_1511.poem_librivox/november_jackson_abb_64kb.mp3", "duration": 62}, {"section": 2, "title": "November - Read by BK", "readers": [8786], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/november_1511.poem_librivox/november_jackson_bk_64kb.mp3", "duration": 89}, {"section": 3, "title": "November - Read by CAM", "readers": [10177], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/november_1511.poem_librivox/november_jackson_cam_64kb.mp3", "duration": 77}, {"section": 4, "title": "November - Read by DL", "readers": [2911], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/november_1511.poem_librivox/november_jackson_dl_64kb.mp3", "duration": 72}, {"section": 5, "title": "November - Read by EL", "readers": [9872], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/november_1511.poem_librivox/november_jackson_el_64kb.mp3", "duration": 76}, {"section": 6, "title": "November - Read by GB", "readers": [4969], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/november_1511.poem_librivox/november_jackson_gb_64kb.mp3", "duration": 80}, {"section": 7, "title": "November - Read by JM", "readers": [9902], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/november_1511.poem_librivox/november_jackson_jm_64kb.mp3", "duration": 68}, {"section": 8, "title": "November - Read by LAH", "readers": [1212], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/november_1511.poem_librivox/november_jackson_lah_64kb.mp3", "duration": 74}, {"section": 9, "title": "November - Read by LLW", "readers": [4738], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/november_1511.poem_librivox/november_jackson_llw_64kb.mp3", "duration": 84}, {"section": 10, "title": "November - Read by MK", "readers": [8051], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/november_1511.poem_librivox/november_jackson_mk_64kb.mp3", "duration": 79}, {"section": 11, "title": "November - Read by PS", "readers": [8576], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/november_1511.poem_librivox/november_jackson_ps_64kb.mp3", "duration": 64}, {"section": 12, "title": "November - Read by TA", "readers": [10289], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/november_1511.poem_librivox/november_jackson_ta_64kb.mp3", "duration": 121}]}
