{"title": "Daughter of the Land (version 2)", "description": "A Daughter of the Land follows Kate Bates, one of sixteen children, as she takes the wings of morning to try for independence and the life she's been denied. She dreams of a husband, children, and a farm, yet her actions have far-reaching consequences.  This is a story of love and forgiveness, a picture of the brokenness around us, and it shows how God can make all things work together for good and shed hope and light in the midst of the valley of the shadow. - Summary by Patience Charles", "duration": 39949, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "801", "name": "Gene Stratton-Porter"}], "coverArt":
