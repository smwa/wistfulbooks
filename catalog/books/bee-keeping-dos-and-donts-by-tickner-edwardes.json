{"title": "Bee-Keeping Do\u2019s and Dont\u2019s", "description": "Originally published by a master bee-keeper in 1925, this book \u2018Bee-Keeping Do\u2019s and Dont\u2019s\u2019 was written to compliment an earlier book produced by the author - \u2018Bee-Keeping For All\u2019, to address specific difficulties that a bee-keeper might encounter in their apiary and to offer tried and tested ideas and solutions that might help overcome these problem areas.\r\nTickner Edwardes was well known around the South Downs in West Sussex as 'The Bee-man of Burpham.' He shares his extensive practical understanding and in-depth knowledge of apiculture which could be of significant use to any bee-keeper, whether they are a beginner in bee-craft or an experienced apiculturalist.\r\nThe book \u2018Bee-Keeping For All\u2019 by Tickner Edwardes that compliments this publication is also available in ebook and audiobook formats.\r\n - Summary by Steve C", "duration": 6820, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "11276", "name": "Tickner Edwardes"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/beekeepingdosanddonts_2506_librivox/beekeeping_donts_2506.jpg", "copyright_year": "1925", "genres": ["Nature"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Steve C"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Steve C"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "DaveC"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "DaveC"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "How To Become a Bee-Keeper", "readers": [7389], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/beekeepingdosanddonts_2506_librivox/beekeepingdosdonts_01_edwardes_64kb.mp3", "duration": 902}, {"section": 2, "title": "A Swarm In May", "readers": [7389], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/beekeepingdosanddonts_2506_librivox/beekeepingdosdonts_02_edwardes_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1352}, {"section": 3, "title": "Spring and Summer Management", "readers": [7389], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/beekeepingdosanddonts_2506_librivox/beekeepingdosdonts_03_edwardes_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2711}, {"section": 4, "title": "Autumn and Winter Management", "readers": [7389], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/beekeepingdosanddonts_2506_librivox/beekeepingdosdonts_04_edwardes_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1144}, {"section": 5, "title": "Diseases of Bees", "readers": [7389], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/beekeepingdosanddonts_2506_librivox/beekeepingdosdonts_05_edwardes_64kb.mp3", "duration": 711}]}
