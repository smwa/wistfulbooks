{"title": "Commentary on Romans", "description": "Theodoret was born at Antioch, A.D. 386. His studies were pursued under Theodore of Mopsuista and Chrysostom, from the works of the latter of whom the present commentary is by many esteemed little more than an abridgement. This, however, on comparing the writings of both those Fathers, can hardly perhaps be admitted in its fullest sense.<br><br>\r\n\r\n\"Of all the Fathers, who have composed works of different kinds, Theodoret is one of those who has been very happy in every one of them. There are some who have been excellent writers in matters of controversy, but bad interpreters. Others have been good historians, but bad divines. Some have good success in morality, who have no skill in doctrinal points. And very rare is it for those who have addicted themselves to works of piety to be good critics. Theodoret had all these qualities, and it may be said, that he has equally deserved the name of a good interpreter, divine, historian, writer of controversies, apologist for religion, and author of works of piety. But he has principally excelled in his compositions upon the holy Scripture, in which, according to the judgment of the learned Photius, be has outdone almost all other commentators. 'He passes over nothing,' says that writer, 'which needs explication, nor can we find any who unfolds all manner of difficulties better, and leaves fewer things obscure.'\" - Summary adapted from Introduction", "duration": 15771, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "15803", "name": " Theodoret of Cyrus"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/commentary_on_romans_2108_librivox/commentaryromans_2109.jpg", "copyright_year": "1839", "genres": ["Christianity - Commentary"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "InTheDesert"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "InTheDesert"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "TriciaG"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "pattymarie"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Argument", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/commentary_on_romans_2108_librivox/commentaryromans_00_theodoret_64kb.mp3", "duration": 233}, {"section": 1, "title": "Romans Chapter 1", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/commentary_on_romans_2108_librivox/commentaryromans_01_theodoret_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1757}, {"section": 2, "title": "Romans Chapter 2", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/commentary_on_romans_2108_librivox/commentaryromans_02_theodoret_64kb.mp3", "duration": 802}, {"section": 3, "title": "Romans Chapter 3", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/commentary_on_romans_2108_librivox/commentaryromans_03_theodoret_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1042}, {"section": 4, "title": "Romans Chapter 4", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/commentary_on_romans_2108_librivox/commentaryromans_04_theodoret_64kb.mp3", "duration": 706}, {"section": 5, "title": "Romans Chapter 5", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/commentary_on_romans_2108_librivox/commentaryromans_05_theodoret_64kb.mp3", "duration": 796}, {"section": 6, "title": "Romans Chapter 6", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/commentary_on_romans_2108_librivox/commentaryromans_06_theodoret_64kb.mp3", "duration": 768}, {"section": 7, "title": "Romans Chapter 7", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/commentary_on_romans_2108_librivox/commentaryromans_07_theodoret_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1207}, {"section": 8, "title": "Romans Chapter 8", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/commentary_on_romans_2108_librivox/commentaryromans_08_theodoret_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1703}, {"section": 9, "title": "Romans Chapter 9", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/commentary_on_romans_2108_librivox/commentaryromans_09_theodoret_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1415}, {"section": 10, "title": "Romans Chapter 10", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/commentary_on_romans_2108_librivox/commentaryromans_10_theodoret_64kb.mp3", "duration": 555}, {"section": 11, "title": "Romans Chapter 11", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/commentary_on_romans_2108_librivox/commentaryromans_11_theodoret_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1186}, {"section": 12, "title": "Romans Chapter 12", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/commentary_on_romans_2108_librivox/commentaryromans_12_theodoret_64kb.mp3", "duration": 800}, {"section": 13, "title": "Romans Chapter 13", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/commentary_on_romans_2108_librivox/commentaryromans_13_theodoret_64kb.mp3", "duration": 501}, {"section": 14, "title": "Romans Chapter 14", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/commentary_on_romans_2108_librivox/commentaryromans_14_theodoret_64kb.mp3", "duration": 811}, {"section": 15, "title": "Romans Chapter 15", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/commentary_on_romans_2108_librivox/commentaryromans_15_theodoret_64kb.mp3", "duration": 853}, {"section": 16, "title": "Romans Chapter 16", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/commentary_on_romans_2108_librivox/commentaryromans_16_theodoret_64kb.mp3", "duration": 636}]}
