{"title": "Through the Looking-Glass (Version 6)", "description": "Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There (also known as Alice Through the Looking-Glass or simply Through the Looking-Glass) is an 1871 novel by Lewis Carroll and the sequel to Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1865). Alice again enters a fantastical world, this time by climbing through a mirror into the world that she can see beyond it. There she finds that, just like a reflection, everything is reversed, including logic.<br /><br />Alice becomes a player in a game of chess and works her way up to becoming a queen. On her way across the board she meets Tweedledum and Tweedledee, recites the classic poems, \"Jabberwocky\" and \"The Walrus and the Carpenter\", amongst many more. She also demonstrates her ability at mathematics to her new found friends, the red and white queens.<br /><br />The mirror that Alice ventured through is still on display in Charlton Kings, Gloucestershire. Do not let your children too close!!!<br /><br />Warning!! Do not listen to this audio recording without looking at these classic images by 'John Tenniel'; they will put everything into reverse perspective. \nDownload them here: <a href=\"https://www.alice-in-wonderland.net/resources/pictures/through-the-looking-glass/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.alice-in-wonderland.net/resources/pictures/through-the-looking-glass/</a><br /> (Summary by Craig Franklin)", "duration": 12645, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "71", "name": "Lewis Carroll"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/throughthelookingglass_2006_librivox/throughthelookingglass_2006.jpg", "copyright_year": "0", "genres": ["Action & Adventure", "Poetry"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Craig Franklin"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Craig Franklin"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "TriciaG"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Jenn Broda"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "CHAPTER I.
