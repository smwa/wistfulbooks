{"title": "Nelly Channell", "description": "Another fascinating book by the author of A Vanished Hand. Rhoda returns home after the death of her employer to find out that her cousin Helen, with whom she was raised, also returned home. Her husband stole 300 pounds and had to run away to Australia and leave her pregnant. Rhoda has to reconcile her shame and learn to cope with the new situation. But nothing is as it seems. More than anything, this book is about breaking stigmas and opening up your mind to understand and love people, despite their faults, usually with the help of God. Perfect for fans of good novels about crimes, stories about childhood, along with lovers of religious fiction. - Summary by Stav Nisser.", "duration": 11959, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "13398", "name": "Sarah  Doudney "}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/nelly_channell_1809_librivox/nelly_channell_1809.jpg", "copyright_year": "1883", "genres": ["Crime & Mystery Fiction", "Religious Fiction"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Stav Nisser"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Jordan Watts"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Chapter 1: The Home at Huntsdean, and its New Inmates", "readers": [10159], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/nelly_channell_1809_librivox/nellychannell_01_doudney_64kb.mp3", "duration": 985}, {"section": 2, "title": "Chapter 2: Brother and Sister. - Rhoda Farren perplexed", "readers": [10159], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/nelly_channell_1809_librivox/nellychannell_02_doudney_64kb.mp3", "duration": 293}, {"section": 3, "title": "Chapter 3: A Spared Life. - News from Robert Clarris", "readers": [10159], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/nelly_channell_1809_librivox/nellychannell_03_doudney_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1310}, {"section": 4, "title": "Chapter 4: An Invitation from Squire Derrick", "readers": [10159], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/nelly_channell_1809_librivox/nellychannell_04_doudney_64kb.mp3", "duration": 539}, {"section": 5, "title": "Chapter 5: Helen under a New Aspect", "readers": [10159], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/nelly_channell_1809_librivox/nellychannell_05_doudney_64kb.mp3", "duration": 700}, {"section": 6, "title": "Chapter 6: The Master is come, and calleth for thee", "readers": [10159], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/nelly_channell_1809_librivox/nellychannell_06_doudney_64kb.mp3", "duration": 880}, {"section": 7, "title": "Chapter 7: The Disposal of Helen\u2019s Jewels", "readers": [10159], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/nelly_channell_1809_librivox/nellychannell_07_doudney_64kb.mp3", "duration": 420}, {"section": 8, "title": "Chapter 8: The Farm purchased by one Ralph Channell", "readers": [10159], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/nelly_channell_1809_librivox/nellychannell_08_doudney_64kb.mp3", "duration": 831}, {"section": 9, "title": "Chapter 9: The Consciousness of Battle", "readers": [6836], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/nelly_channell_1809_librivox/nellychannell_09_doudney_64kb.mp3", "duration": 468}, {"section": 10, "title": "Chapter 10: The Story of the Dark Hour", "readers": [6836], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/nelly_channell_1809_librivox/nellychannell_10_doudney_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1271}, {"section": 11, "title": "Chapter 11: Nelly Channell", "readers": [6836], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/nelly_channell_1809_librivox/nellychannell_11_doudney_64kb.mp3", "duration": 528}, {"section": 12, "title": "Chapter 12: Morgan Foster, the New Curate", "readers": [12734], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/nelly_channell_1809_librivox/nellychannell_12_doudney_64kb.mp3", "duration": 488}, {"section": 13, "title": "Chapter 13: What a little Poem revealed", "readers": [12734], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/nelly_channell_1809_librivox/nellychannell_13_doudney_64kb.mp3", "duration": 482}, {"section": 14, "title": "Chapter 14: Eve Hazleburn, Poet and Friend", "readers": [12734], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/nelly_channell_1809_librivox/nellychannell_14_doudney_64kb.mp3", "duration": 613}, {"section": 15, "title": "Chapter 15: A Confession overheard", "readers": [12734], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/nelly_channell_1809_librivox/nellychannell_15_doudney_64kb.mp3", "duration": 827}, {"section": 16, "title": "Chapter 16: How the Truth came out", "readers": [12734], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/nelly_channell_1809_librivox/nellychannell_16_doudney_64kb.mp3", "duration": 590}, {"section": 17, "title": "Chapter 17: An unlooked-for Release", "readers": [12734], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/nelly_channell_1809_librivox/nellychannell_17_doudney_64kb.mp3", "duration": 522}, {"section": 18, "title": "Chapter 18: What God hath joined together", "readers": [12734], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/nelly_channell_1809_librivox/nellychannell_18_doudney_64kb.mp3", "duration": 212}]}
