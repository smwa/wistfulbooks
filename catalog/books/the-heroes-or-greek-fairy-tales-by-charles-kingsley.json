{"title": "Heroes; Or, Greek Fairy Tales for my Children", "description": "This is Kingsley's masterful retelling of the Greek stories about their Heroes and in a manner suitable for children. \"why have I called this book \u2018The Heroes\u2019?  Because that was the name which the Hellens gave to men who were brave and skilful, and dare do more than other men.  At first, I think, that was all it meant: but after a time it came to mean something more; it came to mean men who helped their country; men in those old times, when the country was half-wild, who killed fierce beasts and evil men, and drained swamps, and founded towns, and therefore after they were dead, were honoured, because they had left their country better than they found it.  And we call such a man a hero in English to this day, and call it a \u2018heroic\u2019 thing to suffer pain and grief, that we may do good to our fellow-men.\"   - Summary by the author and phil chenevert", "duration": 15703, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "545", "name": "Charles Kingsley"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/theheroesorgreekfairytales_2209_librivox/heroes_2209.jpg", "copyright_year": "0", "genres": ["Myths", "Legends & Fairy Tales"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Devorah Allen"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Preface", "readers": [16205], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/theheroesorgreekfairytales_2209_librivox/heroesorgreekfairytales_00_kingsley_64kb.mp3", "duration": 874}, {"section": 1, "title": "Part 1 of Perseus: How Perseus and his Mother came to Seriphos", "readers": [17674], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/theheroesorgreekfairytales_2209_librivox/heroesorgreekfairytales_01_kingsley_64kb.mp3", "duration": 432}, {"section": 2, "title": "Part 2 of Perseus: How Perseus vowed a rash Vow", "readers": [17674], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/theheroesorgreekfairytales_2209_librivox/heroesorgreekfairytales_02_kingsley_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1014}, {"section": 3, "title": "Part 3 of Perseus: How Perseus slew the Gorgon", "readers": [17674], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/theheroesorgreekfairytales_2209_librivox/heroesorgreekfairytales_03_kingsley_64kb.mp3", "duration": 912}, {"section": 4, "title": "Part 4 of Perseus: How Perseus came to the \u00c6thiops", "readers": [17674], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/theheroesorgreekfairytales_2209_librivox/heroesorgreekfairytales_04_kingsley_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1108}, {"section": 5, "title": "Part 5 of Perseus: How Perseus came home again", "readers": [17674], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/theheroesorgreekfairytales_2209_librivox/heroesorgreekfairytales_05_kingsley_64kb.mp3", "duration": 485}, {"section": 6, "title": "Part 1 of the Argonauts:  How the Centaur trained the Heroes on Pelion", "readers": [17662], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/theheroesorgreekfairytales_2209_librivox/heroesorgreekfairytales_06_kingsley_64kb.mp3", "duration": 779}, {"section": 7, "title": "Part 2 of the Argonauts: How Jason lost his Sandal in Anauros", "readers": [17662], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/theheroesorgreekfairytales_2209_librivox/heroesorgreekfairytales_07_kingsley_64kb.mp3", "duration": 783}, {"section": 8, "title": "Part 3 of the Argonauts: How they built the ship \u2018Argo\u2019 in Iolcos", "readers": [17662], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/theheroesorgreekfairytales_2209_librivox/heroesorgreekfairytales_08_kingsley_64kb.mp3", "duration": 380}, {"section": 9, "title": "Part 4 of the Argonauts: How the Argonauts sailed to Colchis", "readers": [17662], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/theheroesorgreekfairytales_2209_librivox/heroesorgreekfairytales_09_kingsley_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2096}, {"section": 10, "title": "Part 5 of the Argonauts: How the Argonauts were driven into the Unknown Sea", "readers": [17662], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/theheroesorgreekfairytales_2209_librivox/heroesorgreekfairytales_10_kingsley_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2149}, {"section": 11, "title": "Part 6 of the Argonauts:   What was the end of the Heroes", "readers": [17662], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/theheroesorgreekfairytales_2209_librivox/heroesorgreekfairytales_11_kingsley_64kb.mp3", "duration": 262}, {"section": 12, "title": "Part 1 of Theseus: How Theseus lifted the Stone", "readers": [16205], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/theheroesorgreekfairytales_2209_librivox/heroesorgreekfairytales_12_kingsley_64kb.mp3", "duration": 528}, {"section": 13, "title": "Part 2 of Theseus: How Theseus slew the Devourers of Men", "readers": [16205], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/theheroesorgreekfairytales_2209_librivox/heroesorgreekfairytales_13_kingsley_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2909}, {"section": 14, "title": "Part 3 of Theseus: How Theseus slew the Minotaur", "readers": [16205], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/theheroesorgreekfairytales_2209_librivox/heroesorgreekfairytales_14_kingsley_64kb.mp3", "duration": 626}, {"section": 15, "title": "Part 4 of Theseus: How Theseus fell by his Pride", "readers": [16205], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/theheroesorgreekfairytales_2209_librivox/heroesorgreekfairytales_15_kingsley_64kb.mp3", "duration": 366}]}
