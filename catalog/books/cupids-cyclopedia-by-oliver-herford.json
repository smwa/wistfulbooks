{"title": "Cupid's Cyclopedia", "description": "This 1910 short work is by the English-born American humorist, satirist, and illustrator Oliver Herford, aided by another caricaturist and illustrator, John Cecil Clay. Herford\u2019s books were usually short and quite popular in their time. He is a master of the witty remark and joke, i.e., \u201cMany are called but few get up\u201d and \u201cOnly the young die good\u201d.  Cupid\u2019s Cyclopedia is a jesting alphabetical list of words and their definitions dealing with the course of true love; the book closes with an essay on the same subject entitled \u201cAmoria,\u201d a tongue-in-cheek imaginative travelogue on \u201cthe most ancient and honorable country upon the earth\u2019s surface.\u201d The text has many illustrations that make the author\u2019s thoughts more entertaining and often clearer. There is an appendix, but the text indicates that it has been removed.
