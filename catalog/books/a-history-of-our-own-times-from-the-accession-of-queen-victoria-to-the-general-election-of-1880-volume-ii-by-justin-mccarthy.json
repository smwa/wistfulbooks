{"title": "History of Our Own Times From the Accession of Queen Victoria to the General Election of 1880, Volume II", "description": "Volume II of this popular history opens in the revolutionary year, 1848, with the Chartist movement for manhood suffrage and with the rise of Young Ireland. Next we join the crowds in 1851 at the opening of the Great Exhibition in Hyde Park, of which Queen Victoria wrote, ''A little rain fell just as we started, but before we came near the Crystal Palace the sun shone and gleamed upon the gigantic edifice, upon which the flags of all nations were floating.'' Hopes for a new era of peace expired in the freezing trenches before Sebastopol, where not even the heroics of the Light Brigade could distract the British public for long from the debacle of failed leadership and the criminal collapse of logistics.
