{"title": "Jefferson Bible - The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth", "description": "The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth, commonly referred to as the Jefferson Bible, was a book constructed by Thomas Jefferson in the later years of his life by cutting and pasting with a razor and glue numerous sections from the New Testament as extractions of the doctrine of Jesus. Jefferson's condensed composition is especially notable for its exclusion of all miracles by Jesus and most mentions of the supernatural, including sections of the four gospels that contain the Resurrection and most other miracles, and passages that portray Jesus as divine. - Summary by Wikipedia", "duration": 11289, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "347", "name": "Thomas Jefferson"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/jefferson_bible_1801_librivox/jefferson_bible_1801.jpg", "copyright_year": "1902", "genres": ["Bibles", "Biography & Autobiography"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Nick Bulka"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Ann Boulais"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Ann Boulais"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Ann Boulais"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Front Matter", "readers": [8307], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/jefferson_bible_1801_librivox/jeffersonbible_00_jefferson_64kb.mp3", "duration": 882}, {"section": 1, "title": "I - XI", "readers": [8307], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/jefferson_bible_1801_librivox/jeffersonbible_01_jefferson_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1726}, {"section": 2, "title": "XII - XXIV", "readers": [8307], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/jefferson_bible_1801_librivox/jeffersonbible_02_jefferson_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1514}, {"section": 3, "title": "XXV - XXXVI", "readers": [11886], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/jefferson_bible_1801_librivox/jeffersonbible_03_jefferson_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1793}, {"section": 4, "title": "XXXVII - XLVI", "readers": [11790], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/jefferson_bible_1801_librivox/jeffersonbible_04_jefferson_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1969}, {"section": 5, "title": "XLVII - LXI", "readers": [6670], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/jefferson_bible_1801_librivox/jeffersonbible_05_jefferson_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1716}, {"section": 6, "title": "LXII - LXIX", "readers": [6670], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/jefferson_bible_1801_librivox/jeffersonbible_06_jefferson_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1689}]}
