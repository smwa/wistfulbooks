{"title": "Beth G\u00ealert, or the Grave of the Greyhound", "description": "LibriVox volunteers bring you 16 recordings of Beth G\u00ealert, or the Grave of the Greyhound by William Robert Spencer. This was the Fortnightly Poetry project for July 8, 2012.<br><br>William Robert Spencer, English poet and wit, was the younger son of Lord Charles Spencer and his wife Mary Beauclerk. Spencer's wit made him a popular member of society. He belonged to the Whig set of Charles James Fox and Richard Brinsley Sheridan and was frequently a guest of the prince of Wales. He did not desire a public life, being content as a writer of \"occasional\" verse and vers de soci\u00e9t\u00e9.<br>His writings were greatly appreciated by his contemporaries, being warmly praised by such figures as Sir Walter Scott, John Wilson, and Lord Byron.
