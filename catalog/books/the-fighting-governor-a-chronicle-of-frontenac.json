In\nshort, the divine right of the king to rule over his people was proclaimed as loudly in the colony as in the motherland.<br /><br />\nThis book follows Frontenac through his life as a public officer in Canada.\n", "duration": 12254, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "4207", "name": " Charles W.
