{"title": "Girl Scouts at Home", "description": "Little Rosanna Horton was a very poor little girl. When I tell you more about her, you will think that was a very odd thing to say.<br /><br />\n\nShe lived in one of the most beautiful homes in Louisville, a city full of beautiful homes. And Rosanna's was one of the loveliest. It was a great, rambling house of red brick with wide porches in the front and on either side. On the right of the house was a wonderful garden. It covered half a square, and was surrounded by a high stone wall. No one could look in to see what she was doing. That was rather nice, but of course no one could look out either to see what they were doing on the brick sidewalk, and that does not seem so nice.  There were children all along the street: little girls playing dolls on front doorsteps and other little girls walking in happy groups or skipping rope. Boys on bicycles circled everywhere and shouted to each other. They made a short cut through one of the poor sections of the city. Here it was the same: children everywhere, all having the best sort of time. They were not so well dressed, that was all the difference. They had the same carefree look in their eyes. Rosanna gazed out wistfully, longingly.<br /><br />\n\nAnd now you surely guess why Rosanna, with her beautiful home, her pony and her playhouse, her lovely garden, and her room full of pretty things, still was so very, very poor.<br /><br />\n\nRosanna did not have a single friend. - Summary by the author", "duration": 13721, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "10210", "name": "Katherine Keene Galt"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/thegirlscoutsathome_1501_librivox/the_girl_scouts_at_home_1502.jpg", "copyright_year": "1921", "genres": ["Family"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Diana Schmidt"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Chapter I", "readers": [9092], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/thegirlscoutsathome_1501_librivox/thegirlscoutsathome_01_galt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 513}, {"section": 2, "title": "Chapter II", "readers": [9092], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/thegirlscoutsathome_1501_librivox/thegirlscoutsathome_02_galt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 428}, {"section": 3, "title": "Chapter III", "readers": [9666], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/thegirlscoutsathome_1501_librivox/thegirlscoutsathome_03_galt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 731}, {"section": 4, "title": "Chapter IV", "readers": [9331], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/thegirlscoutsathome_1501_librivox/thegirlscoutsathome_04_galt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 693}, {"section": 5, "title": "Chapter V", "readers": [9092], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/thegirlscoutsathome_1501_librivox/thegirlscoutsathome_05_galt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 633}, {"section": 6, "title": "Chapter VI", "readers": [9155], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/thegirlscoutsathome_1501_librivox/thegirlscoutsathome_06_galt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 744}, {"section": 7, "title": "Chapter VII", "readers": [9155], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/thegirlscoutsathome_1501_librivox/thegirlscoutsathome_07_galt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 726}, {"section": 8, "title": "Chapter VIII", "readers": [9221], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/thegirlscoutsathome_1501_librivox/thegirlscoutsathome_08_galt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 550}, {"section": 9, "title": "Chapter IX", "readers": [9382], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/thegirlscoutsathome_1501_librivox/thegirlscoutsathome_09_galt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 691}, {"section": 10, "title": "Chapter X", "readers": [9382], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/thegirlscoutsathome_1501_librivox/thegirlscoutsathome_10_galt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 510}, {"section": 11, "title": "Chapter XI", "readers": [9382], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/thegirlscoutsathome_1501_librivox/thegirlscoutsathome_11_galt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 707}, {"section": 12, "title": "Chapter XII", "readers": [9382], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/thegirlscoutsathome_1501_librivox/thegirlscoutsathome_12_galt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 422}, {"section": 13, "title": "Chapter XIII", "readers": [9221], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/thegirlscoutsathome_1501_librivox/thegirlscoutsathome_13_galt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 712}, {"section": 14, "title": "Chapter XIV", "readers": [9221], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/thegirlscoutsathome_1501_librivox/thegirlscoutsathome_14_galt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 774}, {"section": 15, "title": "Chapter XV", "readers": [9221], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/thegirlscoutsathome_1501_librivox/thegirlscoutsathome_15_galt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 760}, {"section": 16, "title": "Chapter XVI", "readers": [8506], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/thegirlscoutsathome_1501_librivox/thegirlscoutsathome_16_galt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 700}, {"section": 17, "title": "Chapter XVII", "readers": [9666], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/thegirlscoutsathome_1501_librivox/thegirlscoutsathome_17_galt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 893}, {"section": 18, "title": "Chapter XVIII", "readers": [7756], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/thegirlscoutsathome_1501_librivox/thegirlscoutsathome_18_galt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 787}, {"section": 19, "title": "Chapter XIX", "readers": [9590], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/thegirlscoutsathome_1501_librivox/thegirlscoutsathome_19_galt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 634}, {"section": 20, "title": "Chapter XX", "readers": [9590], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/thegirlscoutsathome_1501_librivox/thegirlscoutsathome_20_galt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 675}, {"section": 21, "title": "Chapter XXI", "readers": [9331], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/thegirlscoutsathome_1501_librivox/thegirlscoutsathome_21_galt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 438}]}
