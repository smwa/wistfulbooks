{"title": "Red Headed League", "description": "\"The Adventure of the Red-Headed League\" is one of the 56 Sherlock Holmes short stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. It first appeared in The Strand Magazine in August 1891.  Conan Doyle ranked \"The Red-Headed League\" second in his list of his twelve favorite Holmes stories. <br /><br />\n\nIn this story, Holmes is presented with a perplexing mystery involving a league set up to aid and benefit men with especially vivid red hair who live in London.  Is this a crime? Of course not, but even the brilliant Holmes needs 'three pipefulls' of meditation time to penetrate the nefarious plots hidden beneath this seemingly innocuous fraternal aid society.   Listen and enjoy the beautiful way in which only the great Sherlock Holmes deals with the situation.
