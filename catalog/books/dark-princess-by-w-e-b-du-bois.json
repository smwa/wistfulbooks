{"title": "Dark Princess", "description": "This story begins as Matthew Towns, a brilliant young Black medical student, is dismissed from medical school because the white board has decided white women are not appropriate patients for a Black doctor. In disgust with his own country, Matthew leaves America and goes to Europe. While in Berlin, his life is changed forever when he attends a meeting of people who are interested in uplifting all the \u201cdarker races\u201d of the world. He begins from there a four-year journey that sees his fate entwined with the Dark Princess, who is royalty from India. In this story from 1928, Du Bois recounts Towns\u2019 adventures, but also uses events, conversations, and letters between the characters to explore racial and social justice issues.
