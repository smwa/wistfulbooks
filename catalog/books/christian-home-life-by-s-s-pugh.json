{"title": "Christian Home Life", "description": "The more carefully we consider the law of the family as ordained by God, and view it in relation to the higher necessities of man\u2019s spiritual nature, the more fully we must be convinced that He, who knew what was in man, contemplated in this gracious ordinance our highest good as well as our greatest earthly happiness. And when the family relationship is sanctified by piety; when husband and wife are one in the possession of a saving faith and of spiritual hopes; when the children are regarded as a 'heritage of the Lord,' and, therefore, as a sacred trust, of which He will require an account; when the whole home-life is regarded as His,\u2014there is a guarantee for happiness purer and more enduring than any that can exist on this side heaven. The Christian hope gives it its crowning glory, and makes it the purest earthly type of that state of blessedness which the believer can call by no name more endearing than his eternal home .\u2019 - Summary from Introductory", "duration": 20110, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "9431", "name": "S.
