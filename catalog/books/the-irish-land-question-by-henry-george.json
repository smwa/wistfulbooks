{"title": "Irish Land Question", "description": "\"What I want to impress upon those who may read this paper is this: The Irish land question is not a mere local question; it is a universal question. It involves the great problem of the distribution of wealth, which is everywhere forcing itself upon attention. It can not be settled by measures which in their nature can have but a local application. It can only be settled by measures which in their nature will apply everywhere as readily as in Ireland.\" (Summary by Henry George)", "duration": 11226, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "6200", "name": " Henry George"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/irish_land_question_2208_librivox/irishland_2208.jpg", "copyright_year": "1881", "genres": ["Political Science"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Sean Dalton"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Sean Dalton"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "TriciaG"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Dulcamara"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Mr. Justice Fitzgerald speaks truth", "readers": [16717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/irish_land_question_2208_librivox/irishlandquestion_01_george_64kb.mp3", "duration": 788}, {"section": 2, "title": "Nothing peculiar in Irish distress", "readers": [16717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/irish_land_question_2208_librivox/irishlandquestion_02_george_64kb.mp3", "duration": 639}, {"section": 3, "title": "The Irish Question much more than an Irish Question", "readers": [16717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/irish_land_question_2208_librivox/irishlandquestion_03_george_64kb.mp3", "duration": 904}, {"section": 4, "title": "Inadequacy of proposed remedies", "readers": [16717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/irish_land_question_2208_librivox/irishlandquestion_04_george_64kb.mp3", "duration": 603}, {"section": 5, "title": "The first principle to settle: Whose land is it?", "readers": [16717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/irish_land_question_2208_librivox/irishlandquestion_05_george_64kb.mp3", "duration": 323}, {"section": 6, "title": "False position of Irish leaders \u2014 landlords' right is labor's wrong", "readers": [16717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/irish_land_question_2208_librivox/irishlandquestion_06_george_64kb.mp3", "duration": 478}, {"section": 7, "title": "The doctrine of vested rights \u2014 The great-great-grandson of Captain Kidd", "readers": [13278], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/irish_land_question_2208_librivox/irishlandquestion_07_george_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1155}, {"section": 8, "title": "Private property in land must be abolished \u2014 the only way, the easy way", "readers": [16717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/irish_land_question_2208_librivox/irishlandquestion_08_george_64kb.mp3", "duration": 433}, {"section": 9, "title": "Political considerations. \u2014 A frank avowal of principle the best policy", "readers": [16717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/irish_land_question_2208_librivox/irishlandquestion_09_george_64kb.mp3", "duration": 406}, {"section": 10, "title": "Appeals to national animosities wrong and injurious", "readers": [16717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/irish_land_question_2208_librivox/irishlandquestion_10_george_64kb.mp3", "duration": 433}, {"section": 11, "title": "How to combine the strongest force against the least resistance", "readers": [16717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/irish_land_question_2208_librivox/irishlandquestion_11_george_64kb.mp3", "duration": 954}, {"section": 12, "title": "What Americans may learn in the discussion of the Irish Question, and what American experience may teach", "readers": [16717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/irish_land_question_2208_librivox/irishlandquestion_12_george_64kb.mp3", "duration": 292}, {"section": 13, "title": "A little island or a little world", "readers": [16717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/irish_land_question_2208_librivox/irishlandquestion_13_george_64kb.mp3", "duration": 456}, {"section": 14, "title": "Grandeur of the civilization that is possible", "readers": [16717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/irish_land_question_2208_librivox/irishlandquestion_14_george_64kb.mp3", "duration": 710}, {"section": 15, "title": "Barbarism of the civilization that is", "readers": [16717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/irish_land_question_2208_librivox/irishlandquestion_15_george_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1127}, {"section": 16, "title": "True radicalism the true conservatism", "readers": [16717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/irish_land_question_2208_librivox/irishlandquestion_16_george_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1079}, {"section": 17, "title": "\u201cIn hoc Signo Vinces.\u201d", "readers": [16717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/irish_land_question_2208_librivox/irishlandquestion_17_george_64kb.mp3", "duration": 446}]}
