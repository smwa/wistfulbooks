{"title": "Myths and Legends Around the World - Collection 06", "description": "You get to choose what you want to read! (<i>All recordings in English</i>]) So long as the source is Public Domain for you, any short story or chapter that tells of legends, heroes, myths, or ancient lore, is welcome. We are looking for representations of many different cultures within each collection. If you have questions of whether a source is Public Domain for you (<i>remember that if you live outside the U.S., public domain laws may be more strict for you</i>), I recommend asking about that in this project's discussion before you begin recording. Simply post the question with a link to the source you've found.  :)  Limit of 2 sections per reader in a given Myths & Legends collection. - Summary by Lynette Caulkins", "duration": 12400, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "18", "name": " Various"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/mythsandlegendsaroundtheworld-collection06_2101_librivox/mythsandlegends6_2101.jpg", "copyright_year": "0", "genres": ["Culture & Heritage Fiction", "Myths", "Legends & Fairy Tales", "Nature & Animal Fiction"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Lynette Caulkins"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Linette Geisel"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Lynette Caulkins"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "The Apples of Life - Norse", "readers": [15380], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/mythsandlegendsaroundtheworld-collection06_2101_librivox/mlaw06_01_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1074}, {"section": 2, "title": "Rustem's Romance - Persian", "readers": [14201], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/mythsandlegendsaroundtheworld-collection06_2101_librivox/mlaw06_02_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1854}, {"section": 3, "title": "The Goblin of Adachigahara - Japanese", "readers": [11715], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/mythsandlegendsaroundtheworld-collection06_2101_librivox/mlaw06_03_64kb.mp3", "duration": 564}, {"section": 4, "title": "Og King Of Bashan - Hebrew", "readers": [15564], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/mythsandlegendsaroundtheworld-collection06_2101_librivox/mlaw06_04_64kb.mp3", "duration": 661}, {"section": 5, "title": "A Son of Anak - Hebrew", "readers": [15564], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/mythsandlegendsaroundtheworld-collection06_2101_librivox/mlaw06_05_64kb.mp3", "duration": 858}, {"section": 6, "title": "Odin and the All-Wise Giant - Norse", "readers": [14201], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/mythsandlegendsaroundtheworld-collection06_2101_librivox/mlaw06_06_64kb.mp3", "duration": 820}, {"section": 7, "title": "The Ivory City and Its Fairy Princess - Indian", "readers": [15380], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/mythsandlegendsaroundtheworld-collection06_2101_librivox/mlaw06_07_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1852}, {"section": 8, "title": "Turning Everything Into Gold - Greek", "readers": [15588], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/mythsandlegendsaroundtheworld-collection06_2101_librivox/mlaw06_08_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1985}, {"section": 9, "title": "Well O' The World's End - Scottish", "readers": [15607], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/mythsandlegendsaroundtheworld-collection06_2101_librivox/mlaw06_09_64kb.mp3", "duration": 373}, {"section": 10, "title": "Ulysses and the Cyclops - Greek", "readers": [15588], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/mythsandlegendsaroundtheworld-collection06_2101_librivox/mlaw06_10_64kb.mp3", "duration": 896}, {"section": 11, "title": "The Mysterious Servant: The Story of a Young Man Who Respected the Dead - Finnish", "readers": [15432], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/mythsandlegendsaroundtheworld-collection06_2101_librivox/mlaw06_11_64kb.mp3", "duration": 870}, {"section": 12, "title": "Theseus - Greek", "readers": [8576], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/mythsandlegendsaroundtheworld-collection06_2101_librivox/mlaw06_12_64kb.mp3", "duration": 593}]}
