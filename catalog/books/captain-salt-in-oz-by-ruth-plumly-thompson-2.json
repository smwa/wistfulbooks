{"title": "Captain Salt in Oz (Version 2)", "description": "A voyage on the famous Nonestic Ocean! What could be more thrilling than that? We\u2014many of us\u2014have taken trips on the prosaic Atlantic or even Pacific, but have we found a SEA FOREST with flying fish and swimming birds? Have we been pursued by a real SEA SERPENT, or had our ship transfixed by the immense ivory tusk of a NARWHAL? Have we come upon the glittering island of PEAKENSPIRE, or made friends with a charming talking hippopotamus?\r\n\r\nYet all these things and more befall Captain Salt, one time Pirate and now Royal Explorer of Oz, and his merry crew. They come back with their hold bursting with unique and fascinating specimens, with their chart crowded with new islands, claimed for Ozma, and drawn so realistically by the delightful little boy Tandy, Cabin Boy and Artist of the Expedition.", "duration": 19205, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "775", "name": "Ruth Plumly Thompson"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/captain_salt_in_oz_2111_librivox/captainsalt_2111.jpg", "copyright_year": "0", "genres": ["Myths", "Legends & Fairy Tales"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Rich Brown"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Sail Ho!", "readers": [5717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/captain_salt_in_oz_2111_librivox/captainsaltinoz_01_baum_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1145}, {"section": 2, "title": "Anchors Aweigh", "readers": [5717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/captain_salt_in_oz_2111_librivox/captainsaltinoz_02_baum_64kb.mp3", "duration": 579}, {"section": 3, "title": "The Fire Baby", "readers": [5717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/captain_salt_in_oz_2111_librivox/captainsaltinoz_03_baum_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1354}, {"section": 4, "title": "Samuel's First Specimen", "readers": [5717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/captain_salt_in_oz_2111_librivox/captainsaltinoz_04_baum_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1119}, {"section": 5, "title": "Patrippany Island", "readers": [5717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/captain_salt_in_oz_2111_librivox/captainsaltinoz_05_baum_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1216}, {"section": 6, "title": "A Little Wild Man", "readers": [5717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/captain_salt_in_oz_2111_librivox/captainsaltinoz_06_baum_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1147}, {"section": 7, "title": "Strange Specimens for Samuel Salt", "readers": [5717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/captain_salt_in_oz_2111_librivox/captainsaltinoz_07_baum_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1065}, {"section": 8, "title": "Maxims for Monarchs", "readers": [5717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/captain_salt_in_oz_2111_librivox/captainsaltinoz_08_baum_64kb.mp3", "duration": 992}, {"section": 9, "title": "Sea Legs for Tandy", "readers": [5717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/captain_salt_in_oz_2111_librivox/captainsaltinoz_09_baum_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1039}, {"section": 10, "title": "The City of Bridges", "readers": [5717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/captain_salt_in_oz_2111_librivox/captainsaltinoz_10_baum_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1015}, {"section": 11, "title": "The Prince of the Peaks", "readers": [5717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/captain_salt_in_oz_2111_librivox/captainsaltinoz_11_baum_64kb.mp3", "duration": 962}, {"section": 12, "title": "Fog", "readers": [5717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/captain_salt_in_oz_2111_librivox/captainsaltinoz_12_baum_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1105}, {"section": 13, "title": "The Sea Forest", "readers": [5717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/captain_salt_in_oz_2111_librivox/captainsaltinoz_13_baum_64kb.mp3", "duration": 795}, {"section": 14, "title": "The Sea Unicorn!", "readers": [5717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/captain_salt_in_oz_2111_librivox/captainsaltinoz_14_baum_64kb.mp3", "duration": 839}, {"section": 15, "title": "The Collector Is Collected", "readers": [5717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/captain_salt_in_oz_2111_librivox/captainsaltinoz_15_baum_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1073}, {"section": 16, "title": "The Storm!", "readers": [5717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/captain_salt_in_oz_2111_librivox/captainsaltinoz_16_baum_64kb.mp3", "duration": 336}, {"section": 17, "title": "The Old Man of the Jungle!", "readers": [5717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/captain_salt_in_oz_2111_librivox/captainsaltinoz_17_baum_64kb.mp3", "duration": 576}, {"section": 18, "title": "A New Country", "readers": [5717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/captain_salt_in_oz_2111_librivox/captainsaltinoz_18_baum_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1058}, {"section": 19, "title": "Boglodore's Revenge", "readers": [5717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/captain_salt_in_oz_2111_librivox/captainsaltinoz_19_baum_64kb.mp3", "duration": 967}, {"section": 20, "title": "King Tandy", "readers": [5717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/captain_salt_in_oz_2111_librivox/captainsaltinoz_20_baum_64kb.mp3", "duration": 267}, {"section": 21, "title": "A Voyage Resumed", "readers": [5717], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/captain_salt_in_oz_2111_librivox/captainsaltinoz_21_baum_64kb.mp3", "duration": 556}]}
