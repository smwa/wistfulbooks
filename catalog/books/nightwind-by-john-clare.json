{"title": "Nightwind", "description": "LibriVox volunteers bring you 18 recordings of Nightwind by John Clare.<br>\r\nThis was the Weekly Poetry project for June 4, 2023.   <br> ------<br>\r\nClare had bought a copy of James Thomson's The Seasons and began to write poems and sonnets. In an attempt to hold off his parents' eviction from their home, Clare offered his poems to a local bookseller, Edward Drury, who sent them to his cousin, John Taylor of the Taylor & Hessey firm, which had published the work of John Keats. Taylor published Clare's Poems Descriptive of Rural Life and Scenery in 1820. The book was highly praised and the next year his Village Minstrel and Other Poems appeared. \"There was no limit to the applause bestowed upon Clare, unanimous in their admiration of a poetical genius coming before them in the humble garb of a farm labourer.\" (Summary by Wikipedia )", "duration": 1256, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "537", "name": "John Clare"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/nightwind_2306.poem_librivox/nightwind_2306.jpg", "genres": ["Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "David Lawrence"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Nightwind - read by AAM", "readers": [7170], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/nightwind_2306.poem_librivox/nightwind_clare_aam_64kb.mp3", "duration": 77}, {"section": 2, "title": "Nightwind - read by AF", "readers": [11463], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/nightwind_2306.poem_librivox/nightwind_clare_af_64kb.mp3", "duration": 59}, {"section": 3, "title": "Nightwind - read by ALP", "readers": [4705], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/nightwind_2306.poem_librivox/nightwind_clare_alp_64kb.mp3", "duration": 73}, {"section": 4, "title": "Nightwind - read by APS", "readers": [13577], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/nightwind_2306.poem_librivox/nightwind_clare_aps_64kb.mp3", "duration": 78}, {"section": 5, "title": "Nightwind - read by ARB", "readers": [18543], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/nightwind_2306.poem_librivox/nightwind_clare_arb_64kb.mp3", "duration": 65}, {"section": 6, "title": "Nightwind - read by BK", "readers": [8786], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/nightwind_2306.poem_librivox/nightwind_clare_bk_64kb.mp3", "duration": 75}, {"section": 7, "title": "Nightwind - read by DL", "readers": [2911], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/nightwind_2306.poem_librivox/nightwind_clare_dl_64kb.mp3", "duration": 79}, {"section": 8, "title": "Nightwind - read by EL0", "readers": [9872], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/nightwind_2306.poem_librivox/nightwind_clare_el0_64kb.mp3", "duration": 73}, {"section": 9, "title": "Nightwind - read by IK", "readers": [7785], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/nightwind_2306.poem_librivox/nightwind_clare_ik_64kb.mp3", "duration": 75}, {"section": 10, "title": "Nightwind - read by IKL", "readers": [17662], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/nightwind_2306.poem_librivox/nightwind_clare_ikl_64kb.mp3", "duration": 57}, {"section": 11, "title": "Nightwind - read by JO", "readers": [18663], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/nightwind_2306.poem_librivox/nightwind_clare_jo_64kb.mp3", "duration": 55}, {"section": 12, "title": "Nightwind - read by KS", "readers": [13278], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/nightwind_2306.poem_librivox/nightwind_clare_ks_64kb.mp3", "duration": 63}, {"section": 13, "title": "Nightwind - read by LAH", "readers": [1212], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/nightwind_2306.poem_librivox/nightwind_clare_lah_64kb.mp3", "duration": 71}, {"section": 14, "title": "Nightwind - read by LCW", "readers": [8425], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/nightwind_2306.poem_librivox/nightwind_clare_lcw_64kb.mp3", "duration": 70}, {"section": 15, "title": "Nightwind - read by LS", "readers": [15365], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/nightwind_2306.poem_librivox/nightwind_clare_ls_64kb.mp3", "duration": 71}, {"section": 16, "title": "Nightwind - read by RR", "readers": [17752], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/nightwind_2306.poem_librivox/nightwind_clare_rr_64kb.mp3", "duration": 77}, {"section": 17, "title": "Nightwind - read by SWS", "readers": [11331], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/nightwind_2306.poem_librivox/nightwind_clare_sws_64kb.mp3", "duration": 82}, {"section": 18, "title": "Nightwind - read by WA", "readers": [18638], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/nightwind_2306.poem_librivox/nightwind_clare_wa_64kb.mp3", "duration": 56}]}
