{"title": "Old Testament Legends Being Stories Out Of Some Of The Less-Known Apocryphal Books Of The Old Testament", "description": "M R James was a well regarded  English scholar who studied the medieval period (he also wrote great ghost stories!).  Apocryphal books are ancient literatures about biblical events and characters but these books are not included in the Bible.  (Some books regarded as apocryphal by Protestant tradition are included in Catholic, Anglican, and Orthodox Bibles.)  They are sources of stories and legends that were elaborated about the beloved biblical narratives.  The Preface contains a good explanation of apocryphal literature.   In this 1913 book Dr. James has collected and edited eight of those legends.  He intended his book for a youth audience but more mature readers will find the stories no less interesting. - Summary by David Wales", "duration": 12311, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "2959", "name": "M.
