{"title": "''In Re a Gentleman, One''", "description": "Paterson lived and worked in Sydney for most of his adult life, but his poems mostly presented a highly romantic view of the bush and the iconic figure of the bushman. Influenced by the work of another Australian poet John Farrell, his representation of the bushman as a tough, independent and heroic underdog became the ideal qualities underpinning the national character. His work is often compared to the prose of Henry Lawson, particularly the seminal work, \"The Drover's Wife\", which presented a considerably less romantic view of the harshness of rural existence of the late 19th century.\n(In regard to this poem. When an attorney is called before the Full Court to answer for any alleged misconduct it is not usual to publish his name until he is found guilty; until then the matter appears in the papers as \"In re a Gentleman, One of the Attorneys of the Supreme Court,\" or, more shortly, \"In re a Gent., One.\") - Summary by Wikipedia", "duration": 2160, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "3415", "name": "Andrew Barton Paterson"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/in_re_a_gentleman_one_1701.poem_librivox/gentleman_1702.jpg", "copyright_year": "1917", "genres": ["Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "'In Re a Gentleman, One' - Read by ALP", "readers": [4705], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/in_re_a_gentleman_one_1701.poem_librivox/agentleman_paterson_alp_64kb.mp3", "duration": 172}, {"section": 2, "title": "'In Re a Gentleman, One' - Read by BJS", "readers": [3816], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/in_re_a_gentleman_one_1701.poem_librivox/agentleman_paterson_bjs_64kb.mp3", "duration": 179}, {"section": 3, "title": "'In Re a Gentleman, One' - Read by BK", "readers": [8786], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/in_re_a_gentleman_one_1701.poem_librivox/agentleman_paterson_bk_64kb.mp3", "duration": 202}, {"section": 4, "title": "'In Re a Gentleman, One' - Read by BLT", "readers": [6281], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/in_re_a_gentleman_one_1701.poem_librivox/agentleman_paterson_blt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 158}, {"section": 5, "title": "'In Re a Gentleman, One' - Read by DL", "readers": [2911], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/in_re_a_gentleman_one_1701.poem_librivox/agentleman_paterson_dl_64kb.mp3", "duration": 181}, {"section": 6, "title": "'In Re a Gentleman, One' - Read by FS", "readers": [6735], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/in_re_a_gentleman_one_1701.poem_librivox/agentleman_paterson_fs_64kb.mp3", "duration": 194}, {"section": 7, "title": "'In Re a Gentleman, One' - Read by GG", "readers": [8011], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/in_re_a_gentleman_one_1701.poem_librivox/agentleman_paterson_gg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 197}, {"section": 8, "title": "'In Re a Gentleman, One' - Read by JH", "readers": [10205], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/in_re_a_gentleman_one_1701.poem_librivox/agentleman_paterson_jh_64kb.mp3", "duration": 198}, {"section": 9, "title": "'In Re a Gentleman, One' - Read by MSD", "readers": [10891], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/in_re_a_gentleman_one_1701.poem_librivox/agentleman_paterson_msd_64kb.mp3", "duration": 171}, {"section": 10, "title": "'In Re a Gentleman, One' - Read by SS", "readers": [11331], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/in_re_a_gentleman_one_1701.poem_librivox/agentleman_paterson_ss_64kb.mp3", "duration": 156}, {"section": 11, "title": "'In Re a Gentleman, One' - Read by TP", "readers": [10789], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/in_re_a_gentleman_one_1701.poem_librivox/agentleman_paterson_tp_64kb.mp3", "duration": 169}, {"section": 12, "title": "'In Re a Gentleman, One' - Read by VB", "readers": [8169], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/in_re_a_gentleman_one_1701.poem_librivox/agentleman_paterson_vb_64kb.mp3", "duration": 183}]}
