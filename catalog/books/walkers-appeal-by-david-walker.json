{"title": "Walker's Appeal", "description": "The Appeal grabbed readers\u2019 attention in as dramatic a manner as Walker could have possibly imagined. In her book, Maria W. Stewart and the Roots of Black Political Thought, Kirsten Waters writes about how the pamphlet itself was viewed as dangerous by pro-slavery forces, while Walker actively worked to get his text in the hands of Black readers. He did not direct his writing to White audiences, and in the third edition added a special message to Black readers, saying that: <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is expected that all coloured men, women, and children\u2020 of every nation, language, and tongue under heaven, will try to procure a copy of this Appeal and read it, or get some one to read it to them, for it is designed more particularly for them.", "duration": 10685, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "16915", "name": "David Walker"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/walkers_appeal_2205_librivox/walkers_appeal_2205.jpg", "copyright_year": "1830", "genres": ["History", "Law", "Self-Help"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Jim Locke"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Jim Locke"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "DaveC"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "DaveC"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Title Page, Note, and Preamble", "readers": [10801], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/walkers_appeal_2205_librivox/appeal_1_walker_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1010}, {"section": 2, "title": "Article 1", "readers": [10801], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/walkers_appeal_2205_librivox/appeal_2_walker_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1569}, {"section": 3, "title": "Article 2", "readers": [10801], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/walkers_appeal_2205_librivox/appeal_3_walker_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2029}, {"section": 4, "title": "Article 3", "readers": [10801], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/walkers_appeal_2205_librivox/appeal_4_walker_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1131}, {"section": 5, "title": "Article 4, Part 1", "readers": [10801], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/walkers_appeal_2205_librivox/appeal_5_walker_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1505}, {"section": 6, "title": "Article 4, Part 2", "readers": [10801], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/walkers_appeal_2205_librivox/appeal_6_walker_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1521}, {"section": 7, "title": "Article 4, Part 3", "readers": [10801], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/walkers_appeal_2205_librivox/appeal_7_walker_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1291}, {"section": 8, "title": "In Conclusion", "readers": [10801], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/walkers_appeal_2205_librivox/appeal_8_walker_64kb.mp3", "duration": 629}]}
