{"title": "Harper's Young People, Vol. 01, Issue 28, May 11, 1880", "description": "Harper's Young People is an illustrated weekly publication for children that includes short stories, tales from history, natural history, poetry, puzzles, and other fun. This 28th issue of the serial was published on May 11th, 1880. In this issue, General George Washington retires from the military and happily prepares for a life of farming and family at Mount Vernon after years of service to his new country. We also check in on our favorite young sailor as his story continues and we find his ship passing through the Suez Canal and encountering -- and battling -- a waterspout! Highlights of other stories in this issue include: gold rush trickery and riches, a wayward donkey and a disruptive student learn to change their ways, a thrilling boarding school boat race, and the helpful, disgusting habits of marabous and hyenas. This periodical was published by Harper & Brothers, known today for their publications Harper's Bazaar and Harper's Magazine. - Summary by Jill Engle", "duration": 6890, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "18", "name": " Various"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/hyp028_2112_librivox/harpers_young_1_28_2112.jpg", "copyright_year": "1880", "genres": ["Children's Fiction", "Children's Non-fiction", "Short Stories"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Jill Engle"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "J.
