{"title": "Christianity and Liberalism", "description": "The purpose of this book is not to decide the religious issue of the present day, but merely to present the issue as sharply and clearly as possible, in order that the reader may be aided in deciding it for himself...In the sphere of religion, in particular, the present time is a time of conflict; the great redemptive religion which has always been known as Christianity is battling against a totally diverse type of religious belief, which is only the more destructive of the Christian faith because it makes use of traditional Christian terminology. This modern non-redemptive religion is called \u201cmodernism\u201d or \u201cliberalism.\u201d...we shall be interested in showing that despite the liberal use of traditional phraseology, modern liberalism not only is a different religion from Christianity but belongs in a totally different class of religions. - Summary Adapted from Introduction", "duration": 18364, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "16024", "name": "John Gresham Machen"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/christianityandliberalism_2107_librivox/christalib_2107.jpg", "copyright_year": "1923", "genres": ["Christianity - Other"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "InTheDesert"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "InTheDesert"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "TriciaG"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Introduction", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/christianityandliberalism_2107_librivox/christianityliberalism_01_machen_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1571}, {"section": 2, "title": "Doctrine", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/christianityandliberalism_2107_librivox/christianityliberalism_02_machen_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3783}, {"section": 3, "title": "God and Man", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/christianityandliberalism_2107_librivox/christianityliberalism_03_machen_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1543}, {"section": 4, "title": "The Bible", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/christianityandliberalism_2107_librivox/christianityliberalism_04_machen_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1081}, {"section": 5, "title": "Christ", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/christianityandliberalism_2107_librivox/christianityliberalism_05_machen_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3854}, {"section": 6, "title": "Salvation", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/christianityandliberalism_2107_librivox/christianityliberalism_06_machen_64kb.mp3", "duration": 4085}, {"section": 7, "title": "The Church", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/christianityandliberalism_2107_librivox/christianityliberalism_07_machen_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2447}]}
