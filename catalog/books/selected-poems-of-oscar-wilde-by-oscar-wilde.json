{"title": "Selected Poems of Oscar Wilde", "description": "This is a selection of the early poetry of Oscar Wilde, selected by Robert Ross. As he puts it, \"It is thought that a selection from Oscar Wilde\u2019s early verses may be of interest to a large public at present familiar only with the always popular Ballad of Reading Gaol, also included in this volume.  The poems were first collected by their author when he was twenty-six years old, and though never, until recently, well received by the critics, have survived the test of NINE editions.  Readers will be able to make for themselves the obvious and striking contrasts between these first and last phases of Oscar Wilde\u2019s literary activity.  The intervening period was devoted almost entirely to dramas, prose, fiction, essays, and criticism.\" - Summary by Carolin and Robert Ross", "duration": 5882, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "6219", "name": "Robert Baldwin Ross"}, {"id": "114", "name": "Oscar Wilde"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt16/poems_wilde_1607.jpg", "copyright_year": "1911", "genres": ["Poetry"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Crln Yldz Ksr"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Crln Yldz Ksr"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Sonia"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "The Ballad of Reading Gaol, I", "readers": [10579], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/selected_poems_wilde_1607_librivox/selectedpoems_01_wilde_64kb.mp3", "duration": 333}, {"section": 2, "title": "The Ballad of Reading Gaol, II", "readers": [10579], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/selected_poems_wilde_1607_librivox/selectedpoems_02_wilde_64kb.mp3", "duration": 285}, {"section": 3, "title": "The Ballad of Reading Gaol, III", "readers": [10579], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/selected_poems_wilde_1607_librivox/selectedpoems_03_wilde_64kb.mp3", "duration": 742}, {"section": 4, "title": "The Ballad of Reading Gaol, IV", "readers": [10579], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/selected_poems_wilde_1607_librivox/selectedpoems_04_wilde_64kb.mp3", "duration": 466}, {"section": 5, "title": "The Ballad of Reading Gaol, V", "readers": [10579], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/selected_poems_wilde_1607_librivox/selectedpoems_05_wilde_64kb.mp3", "duration": 362}, {"section": 6, "title": "The Ballad of Reading Gaol, VI", "readers": [10579], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/selected_poems_wilde_1607_librivox/selectedpoems_06_wilde_64kb.mp3", "duration": 80}, {"section": 7, "title": "The Ballad of Reading Gaol (Shorter Version), I", "readers": [6965], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/selected_poems_wilde_1607_librivox/selectedpoems_07_wilde_64kb.mp3", "duration": 287}, {"section": 8, "title": "The Ballad of Reading Gaol (Shorter Version), II", "readers": [6965], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/selected_poems_wilde_1607_librivox/selectedpoems_08_wilde_64kb.mp3", "duration": 144}, {"section": 9, "title": "The Ballad of Reading Gaol (Shorter Version), III", "readers": [6965], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/selected_poems_wilde_1607_librivox/selectedpoems_09_wilde_64kb.mp3", "duration": 407}, {"section": 10, "title": "The Ballad of Reading Gaol (Shorter Version), IV", "readers": [6965], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/selected_poems_wilde_1607_librivox/selectedpoems_10_wilde_64kb.mp3", "duration": 358}, {"section": 11, "title": "Ave Imperatrix", "readers": [4705], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/selected_poems_wilde_1607_librivox/selectedpoems_11_wilde_64kb.mp3", "duration": 384}, {"section": 12, "title": "To My Wife (with a copy of my poems)", "readers": [10952], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/selected_poems_wilde_1607_librivox/selectedpoems_12_wilde_64kb.mp3", "duration": 39}, {"section": 13, "title": "Magdalen Walks", "readers": [10159], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/selected_poems_wilde_1607_librivox/selectedpoems_13_wilde_64kb.mp3", "duration": 120}, {"section": 14, "title": "Theocritus -
