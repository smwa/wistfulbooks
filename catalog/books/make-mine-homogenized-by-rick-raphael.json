{"title": "Make Mine Homogenized", "description": "Widowed cattle rancher Hetty Thompson had done all right for herself since Big Jim\u2019s death.

It wasn\u2019t so bad for a while. Then Hetty\u2019s chickens began laying golden eggs, and her prize Guernsey produced explosive milk. Nevada ranch folk are tough but are they ready for mutant livestock?
