{"title": "Settlers of the Marsh", "description": "The novel \u201cSettlers of the Marsh\u201d (1925) is a foundational work of realism in Canadian fiction. Its author, Frederick Philip Grove, a German immigrant, settled in Manitoba and wrote vividly about the struggles of settlers in the early multi-ethnic communities of western Canada. The protagonist of \u201cSettlers of the Marsh\u201d is a Swedish immigrant who wrestles in stoic solitude with the hardships of pioneer life, only to discover that he has been catastrophically na\u00efve about relations with women. Some early reviewers objected that the novel\u2019s treatment of sexuality was \u201cindecent,\u201d but the book is today seen as a cornerstone of Canadian literature. - Summary by Bruce Pirie", "duration": 36129, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "16343", "name": "Frederick  Philip Grove"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/settlers_marsh_2209_librivox/settlers_2209.jpg", "copyright_year": "1925", "genres": ["Literary Fiction", "Published 1900 onward"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Bruce Pirie"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Bruce Pirie"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Amy Gramour"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Alayna Stevenson"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Chapter 1a.
