{"title": "Watt's Songs Against Faults", "description": "These superb poems by the hymnist and theologian Isaac Watts emphasize the importance of developing a positive moral outlook and stress the significance of maintaining vigilance to avoid the pitfalls of everyday life. \n\nBut although Watts stresses the urgency of heeding the advice outlined in these verses, he delivers his message with divine charm and subtle counsel - never with chastisement, reprimand or rebuke. \n\nThese inspiring works constitute a written ethical compass for all who are tempted by forces detrimental to their well being - an ethical compass whose needle points the way to higher self-esteem, enhanced success and the exhilaration gained from choosing and following the right path through a life fraught with hazards and temptations. \n - Summary by Bruce Kachuk", "duration": 653, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "194", "name": "Isaac Watts"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/wattssongsagainstfaults_2011_librivox/againstfaults_2011.jpg", "copyright_year": "0", "genres": ["Poetry"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Bruce Kachuk"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Bruce Kachuk"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Devorah Allen"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Rapunzelina"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Against Lying", "readers": [8786], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/wattssongsagainstfaults_2011_librivox/wattssongsagainstfaults_1_watts_64kb.mp3", "duration": 109}, {"section": 2, "title": "Love between Brothers and Sisters", "readers": [8786], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/wattssongsagainstfaults_2011_librivox/wattssongsagainstfaults_2_watts_64kb.mp3", "duration": 96}, {"section": 3, "title": "Against Idleness and Mischief", "readers": [8786], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/wattssongsagainstfaults_2011_librivox/wattssongsagainstfaults_3_watts_64kb.mp3", "duration": 69}, {"section": 4, "title": "Solemn Thoughts on God and Death", "readers": [8786], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/wattssongsagainstfaults_2011_librivox/wattssongsagainstfaults_4_watts_64kb.mp3", "duration": 111}, {"section": 5, "title": "Summer's Evening", "readers": [8786], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/wattssongsagainstfaults_2011_librivox/wattssongsagainstfaults_5_watts_64kb.mp3", "duration": 91}, {"section": 6, "title": "Against Quarrelling and Fighting", "readers": [8786], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/wattssongsagainstfaults_2011_librivox/wattssongsagainstfaults_6_watts_64kb.mp3", "duration": 89}, {"section": 7, "title": "Our Saviour's Golden Rule", "readers": [8786], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/wattssongsagainstfaults_2011_librivox/wattssongsagainstfaults_7_watts_64kb.mp3", "duration": 35}, {"section": 8, "title": "Duty to God and Our Neighbour", "readers": [8786], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/wattssongsagainstfaults_2011_librivox/wattssongsagainstfaults_8_watts_64kb.mp3", "duration": 53}]}
