{"title": "Practice of Prayer", "description": "God has made prayer possible to us through Jesus.  We can pray prevailingly only as we respond to the truths which create the possibility.  The sphere of prayer includes the coming of the Kingdom of God and the provision of all the need of the saints.  Thus all these constitute an integral part of the subject of the practice of prayer.  Prayer is only possible to the revealed Father through the mediating Son by the inspiring Spirit.  Prayer is only a prevailing power as, in the life, the child of God is loyal to His Kingship, satisfied with His provision, conformed to His likeness.  Moreover, it can only be operative within the sphere revealed in the pattern of prayer. (G. Campbell Morgan)", "duration": 10259, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "1871", "name": "G.
