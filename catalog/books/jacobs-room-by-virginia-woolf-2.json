{"title": "Jacob's Room (version 2)", "description": "Virginia Woolf\u2019s third novel lacks a conventional narrative style and some say even a plot. It follows Jacob from his childhood, through his education at Cambridge and finally to his death in World War I. The prose repeatedly shifts its point of view and the reader is challenged to find connections between the narrative fragments. Largely from the comments of others we come to know the sequence and some moments of Jacob\u2019s life but we never fully learn who Jacob is. The literary experimentation in Jacob\u2019s Room is used even more successfully in Woolf\u2019s later novels.
