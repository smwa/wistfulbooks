{"title": "Selections from the Table Talk of Martin Luther", "description": "When Martin Luther promulgated his \u201c95 Theses\u201d 1n 1517, he probably did not envision the initiation of the historical division of the indivisible Church, beginning what we now know as the Protestant Reformation.  For his opposition to such practices as indulgences and Papal infallibility, he was excommunicated by Pope Leo X, and later, at the Diet of Worms, was declared an outlaw of the state.  Luther made use of the new printing technology of Gutenberg to disseminate his writings.  \nThe first publication of his \u201cTable Talk\u201d (Colloquia Mensalia) was in 1566 arranged into 80 chapters.  The complete work was published in Stuttgart and Leipzig in 1836 in the equivalent of 2,780 pages.  Captain Henry Bell undertook the translation of these selections from the high German and published it in 1561.   The topics are drawn from conversation with many of the great minds of Luther\u2019s day and cover topics from The Word of God to Imperial Diets.\n - Summary by Larry Wilson", "duration": 13546, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "1342", "name": "Martin Luther"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/table_talk_martin_luther_1801_librivox/selections_martin_luther_1801.jpg", "copyright_year": "1886", "genres": ["Religion"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Larry Wilson"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Amy Gramour"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "DrPGould"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Introduction", "readers": [8425], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/table_talk_martin_luther_1801_librivox/tabletalk_01_luther_64kb.mp3", "duration": 284}, {"section": 2, "title": "Testimony of Joannes Aurifaber", "readers": [8425], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/table_talk_martin_luther_1801_librivox/tabletalk_02_luther_64kb.mp3", "duration": 191}, {"section": 3, "title": "Captain Henry Bell's Narrative", "readers": [8425], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/table_talk_martin_luther_1801_librivox/tabletalk_03_luther_64kb.mp3", "duration": 847}, {"section": 4, "title": "A Copy of the Order from the House of Commons", "readers": [8425], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/table_talk_martin_luther_1801_librivox/tabletalk_04_luther_64kb.mp3", "duration": 101}, {"section": 5, "title": "Of the Word of God Part I", "readers": [11884], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/table_talk_martin_luther_1801_librivox/tabletalk_05_luther_64kb.mp3", "duration": 879}, {"section": 6, "title": "Of the Word of God Part II", "readers": [11884], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/table_talk_martin_luther_1801_librivox/tabletalk_06_luther_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1035}, {"section": 7, "title": "Of the Word of God Part III", "readers": [11884], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/table_talk_martin_luther_1801_librivox/tabletalk_07_luther_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1178}, {"section": 8, "title": "Of God's Work Part I", "readers": [4570], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/table_talk_martin_luther_1801_librivox/tabletalk_08_luther_64kb.mp3", "duration": 905}, {"section": 9, "title": "Of God's Work Part II", "readers": [4570], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/table_talk_martin_luther_1801_librivox/tabletalk_09_luther_64kb.mp3", "duration": 924}, {"section": 10, "title": "Of the Nature of the World Part I", "readers": [11084], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/table_talk_martin_luther_1801_librivox/tabletalk_10_luther_64kb.mp3", "duration": 731}, {"section": 11, "title": "Of the Nature of the World Part II", "readers": [11084], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/table_talk_martin_luther_1801_librivox/tabletalk_11_luther_64kb.mp3", "duration": 769}, {"section": 12, "title": "Of the Lord Christ", "readers": [4570], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/table_talk_martin_luther_1801_librivox/tabletalk_12_luther_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1005}, {"section": 13, "title": "Of Sins and of Free-will", "readers": [8576], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/table_talk_martin_luther_1801_librivox/tabletalk_13_luther_64kb.mp3", "duration": 206}, {"section": 14, "title": "Brief Sentences of the Catechism", "readers": [11651], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/table_talk_martin_luther_1801_librivox/tabletalk_14_luther_64kb.mp3", "duration": 604}, {"section": 15, "title": "Of the Law and the Gospels", "readers": [11651], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/table_talk_martin_luther_1801_librivox/tabletalk_15_luther_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1006}, {"section": 16, "title": "Of Prayer", "readers": [8425], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/table_talk_martin_luther_1801_librivox/tabletalk_16_luther_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1261}, {"section": 17, "title": "Of the Confessions and Constancy of the Doctrine", "readers": [11651], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/table_talk_martin_luther_1801_librivox/tabletalk_17_luther_64kb.mp3", "duration": 204}, {"section": 18, "title": "Of Imperial Diets Part I", "readers": [12046], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/table_talk_martin_luther_1801_librivox/tabletalk_18_luther_64kb.mp3", "duration": 709}, {"section": 19, "title": "Of Imperial Diets Part II", "readers": [12046], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/table_talk_martin_luther_1801_librivox/tabletalk_19_luther_64kb.mp3", "duration": 707}]}
