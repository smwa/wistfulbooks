{"title": "Just Men of Cordova", "description": "In \u201cThe Just Men of Cordova (1917)\u201d, European financiers are dying conveniently from London to Cordova, victims of a mysterious poison that the police have failed to identify. In his earlier book, Edgar Wallace\u2019s Four Just Men (1905) traveled the globe meting out vigilante justice. Renowned for their cunning, tenacity, lock breaking skills, and mastery of disguise, they operate outside the law, where their lethal brand of justice strikes fear into the hearts of their prey. But just who are they and who is assisting them?\r\n\r\nFrom the golden age of detective fiction, Edgar Wallace was a prolific author with over 170 novels to his credit, including King Kong. More than 160 films have been made of his works, and a publisher once claimed that a quarter of all books read in England at the time were written by him.   - Summary by ASharma", "duration": 18937, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "2079", "name": "Edgar Wallace"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/justmenofcordova_2409_librivox/justmenofcordova_2409.jpg", "copyright_year": "1917", "genres": ["Detective Fiction"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Atul Sharma"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Atul Sharma"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Christine Rottger"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "mleigh"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Three Men of Cordova", "readers": [18980], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/justmenofcordova_2409_librivox/justmenofcordova_01_wallace_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1809}, {"section": 2, "title": "Colonel Black, Financier", "readers": [18980], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/justmenofcordova_2409_librivox/justmenofcordova_02_wallace_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1759}, {"section": 3, "title": "An Adventure in Pimlico", "readers": [18980], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/justmenofcordova_2409_librivox/justmenofcordova_03_wallace_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1089}, {"section": 4, "title": "The Men who sat in Judgment", "readers": [18980], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/justmenofcordova_2409_librivox/justmenofcordova_04_wallace_64kb.mp3", "duration": 943}, {"section": 5, "title": "The Earl of Verlond", "readers": [18980], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/justmenofcordova_2409_librivox/justmenofcordova_05_wallace_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1052}, {"section": 6, "title": "The Policeman and a Lady", "readers": [18980], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/justmenofcordova_2409_librivox/justmenofcordova_06_wallace_64kb.mp3", "duration": 573}, {"section": 7, "title": "Dr. Essley Meets a Man", "readers": [18980], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/justmenofcordova_2409_librivox/justmenofcordova_07_wallace_64kb.mp3", "duration": 963}, {"section": 8, "title": "Colonel Black has a Shock", "readers": [18980], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/justmenofcordova_2409_librivox/justmenofcordova_08_wallace_64kb.mp3", "duration": 466}, {"section": 9, "title": "Lord Verlond gives a Dinner", "readers": [18980], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/justmenofcordova_2409_librivox/justmenofcordova_09_wallace_64kb.mp3", "duration": 953}, {"section": 10, "title": "A Policeman\u2019s Business", "readers": [18980], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/justmenofcordova_2409_librivox/justmenofcordova_10_wallace_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1226}, {"section": 11, "title": "To Lincoln Races", "readers": [18980], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/justmenofcordova_2409_librivox/justmenofcordova_11_wallace_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1057}, {"section": 12, "title": "The Race", "readers": [18980], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/justmenofcordova_2409_librivox/justmenofcordova_12_wallace_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1854}, {"section": 13, "title": "Who are the Four?", "readers": [18980], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/justmenofcordova_2409_librivox/justmenofcordova_13_wallace_64kb.mp3", "duration": 956}, {"section": 14, "title": "Willie Jakobs Tells", "readers": [18980], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/justmenofcordova_2409_librivox/justmenofcordova_14_wallace_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1427}, {"section": 15, "title": "Sir Isaac\u2019s Fears", "readers": [18980], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/justmenofcordova_2409_librivox/justmenofcordova_15_wallace_64kb.mp3", "duration": 884}, {"section": 16, "title": "Colonel Black Meets a Just Man", "readers": [18980], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/justmenofcordova_2409_librivox/justmenofcordova_16_wallace_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1075}, {"section": 17, "title": "Justice", "readers": [18980], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/justmenofcordova_2409_librivox/justmenofcordova_17_wallace_64kb.mp3", "duration": 851}]}
