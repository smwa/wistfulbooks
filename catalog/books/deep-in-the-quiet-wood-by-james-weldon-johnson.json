{"title": "Deep In The Quiet Wood", "description": "James Weldon Johnson was an American author, educator, lawyer, diplomat, songwriter, and civil rights activist. Johnson is best remembered for his leadership of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), where he started working in 1917. In 1920 he was the first black to be chosen as executive secretary of the organization, effectively the operating officer. He served in that position from 1920 to 1930. Johnson established his reputation as a writer, and was known during the Harlem Renaissance for his poems, novels, and anthologies collecting both poems and spirituals of black culture.", "duration": 1290, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "3012", "name": "James Weldon Johnson"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/deep_in_the_quiet_wood_1504.poem_librivox/deepinquietwood_1504.jpg", "copyright_year": "1917", "genres": ["Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Deep In The Quiet Wood - Read by ALP", "readers": [4705], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/deep_in_the_quiet_wood_1504.poem_librivox/quietwood_johnson_alp_64kb.mp3", "duration": 80}, {"section": 2, "title": "Deep In The Quiet Wood - Read by AMH", "readers": [9920], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/deep_in_the_quiet_wood_1504.poem_librivox/quietwood_johnson_amh_64kb.mp3", "duration": 71}, {"section": 3, "title": "Deep In The Quiet Wood - Read by BK", "readers": [8786], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/deep_in_the_quiet_wood_1504.poem_librivox/quietwood_johnson_bk_64kb.mp3", "duration": 88}, {"section": 4, "title": "Deep In The Quiet Wood - Read by CCS", "readers": [8337], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/deep_in_the_quiet_wood_1504.poem_librivox/quietwood_johnson_ccs_64kb.mp3", "duration": 89}, {"section": 5, "title": "Deep In The Quiet Wood - Read by DL", "readers": [2911], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/deep_in_the_quiet_wood_1504.poem_librivox/quietwood_johnson_dl_64kb.mp3", "duration": 75}, {"section": 6, "title": "Deep In The Quiet Wood - Read by ECB", "readers": [6408], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/deep_in_the_quiet_wood_1504.poem_librivox/quietwood_johnson_ecb_64kb.mp3", "duration": 88}, {"section": 7, "title": "Deep In The Quiet Wood - Read by EL", "readers": [9872], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/deep_in_the_quiet_wood_1504.poem_librivox/quietwood_johnson_el_64kb.mp3", "duration": 61}, {"section": 8, "title": "Deep In The Quiet Wood - Read by GB", "readers": [4969], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/deep_in_the_quiet_wood_1504.poem_librivox/quietwood_johnson_gb_64kb.mp3", "duration": 85}, {"section": 9, "title": "Deep In The Quiet Wood - Read by IK", "readers": [7785], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/deep_in_the_quiet_wood_1504.poem_librivox/quietwood_johnson_ik_64kb.mp3", "duration": 80}, {"section": 10, "title": "Deep In The Quiet Wood - Read by LAH", "readers": [1212], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/deep_in_the_quiet_wood_1504.poem_librivox/quietwood_johnson_lah_64kb.mp3", "duration": 71}, {"section": 11, "title": "Deep In The Quiet Wood - Read by JM", "readers": [9902], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/deep_in_the_quiet_wood_1504.poem_librivox/quietwood_johnson_jm_64kb.mp3", "duration": 69}, {"section": 12, "title": "Deep In The Quiet Wood - Read by MHA", "readers": [9962], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/deep_in_the_quiet_wood_1504.poem_librivox/quietwood_johnson_mha_64kb.mp3", "duration": 80}, {"section": 13, "title": "Deep In The Quiet Wood - Read by MK", "readers": [8051], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/deep_in_the_quiet_wood_1504.poem_librivox/quietwood_johnson_mk_64kb.mp3", "duration": 95}, {"section": 14, "title": "Deep In The Quiet Wood - Read by MTM", "readers": [9963], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/deep_in_the_quiet_wood_1504.poem_librivox/quietwood_johnson_mtm_64kb.mp3", "duration": 102}, {"section": 15, "title": "Deep In The Quiet Wood - Read by NB", "readers": [6965], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/deep_in_the_quiet_wood_1504.poem_librivox/quietwood_johnson_nb_64kb.mp3", "duration": 84}, {"section": 16, "title": "Deep In The Quiet Wood - Read by RC", "readers": [9331], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/deep_in_the_quiet_wood_1504.poem_librivox/quietwood_johnson_rc_64kb.mp3", "duration": 72}]}
