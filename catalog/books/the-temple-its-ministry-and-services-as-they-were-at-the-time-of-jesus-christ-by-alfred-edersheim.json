{"title": "Temple: Its Ministry and Services As They Were at the Time of Jesus Christ", "description": "It has been my wish in this book, to take the reader back eighteen centuries; to show him Jerusalem as it was, when our Lord passed through its streets, and the Sanctuary, when He taught in its porches and courts; to portray, not only the appearance and structure of the Temple, but to describe its ordinances and worshippers, the ministry of its priesthood, and the ritual of its services. In so doing, I have hoped, not only to illustrate a subject, in itself most interesting to the Bible-student, but also, and chiefly, to sketch, in one important aspect, the religious life of the period in which our blessed Lord lived upon earth, the circumstances under which He taught, and the religious rites by which He was surrounded ; and whose meaning, in their truest sense He came to fulfil. - Summary by Preface", "duration": 39919, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "16681", "name": "Alfred Edersheim"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/temple_ministry_2311_librivox/the_temple_2311.jpg", "copyright_year": "1881", "genres": ["Antiquity", "Christianity - Other"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "InTheDesert"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Amy Gramour"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "InTheDesert"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "A First View of Jerusalem, and of the Temple", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/temple_ministry_2311_librivox/temple_01_edersheim_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1739}, {"section": 2, "title": "Within the Holy Place", "readers": [17465], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/temple_ministry_2311_librivox/temple_02_edersheim_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1865}, {"section": 3, "title": "Temple Order, Revenues, and Music", "readers": [17465], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/temple_ministry_2311_librivox/temple_03_edersheim_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2156}, {"section": 4, "title": "The Officiating Priesthood", "readers": [18842], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/temple_ministry_2311_librivox/temple_04_edersheim_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2579}, {"section": 5, "title": "Sacrifices: Their Order and Their Meaning", "readers": [14499], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/temple_ministry_2311_librivox/temple_05_edersheim_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2669}, {"section": 6, "title": "The Burnt-Offering, the Sin- and Trespass-Offering, and the Peace-Offering", "readers": [18914], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/temple_ministry_2311_librivox/temple_06_edersheim_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1935}, {"section": 7, "title": "At Night in the Temple", "readers": [18941], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/temple_ministry_2311_librivox/temple_07_edersheim_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1181}, {"section": 8, "title": "The Morning and the Evening Sacrifice", "readers": [18703], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/temple_ministry_2311_librivox/temple_08_edersheim_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2092}, {"section": 9, "title": "Sabbath in the Temple", "readers": [17465], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/temple_ministry_2311_librivox/temple_09_edersheim_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2009}, {"section": 10, "title": "Festive Cycles and Arrangement of the Calendar", "readers": [17465], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/temple_ministry_2311_librivox/temple_10_edersheim_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1339}, {"section": 11, "title": "The Passover", "readers": [15508], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/temple_ministry_2311_librivox/temple_11_edersheim_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2200}, {"section": 12, "title": "The Paschal Feast and the Lord\u2019s Supper", "readers": [17465], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/temple_ministry_2311_librivox/temple_12_edersheim_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2060}, {"section": 13, "title": "The Feast of Unleavened Bread and the Day of Pentecost", "readers": [18842], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/temple_ministry_2311_librivox/temple_13_edersheim_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2167}, {"section": 14, "title": "The Feast of Tabernacles", "readers": [18842], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/temple_ministry_2311_librivox/temple_14_edersheim_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2371}, {"section": 15, "title": "The New Moons: The Feast of the Seventh New Moon, or of Trumpets, or New Year's Day", "readers": [17465], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/temple_ministry_2311_librivox/temple_15_edersheim_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1355}, {"section": 16, "title": "The Day of Atonement", "readers": [17465], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/temple_ministry_2311_librivox/temple_16_edersheim_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2781}, {"section": 17, "title": "Post-Mosaic Festivals", "readers": [18842], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/temple_ministry_2311_librivox/temple_17_edersheim_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1335}, {"section": 18, "title": "On Purifications \u2014 The Burning of the Red Heifer \u2014 The Cleansing of the Healed Leper \u2014 The Trial of the Woman Suspected of Adultery", "readers": [17465], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/temple_ministry_2311_librivox/temple_18_edersheim_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2319}, {"section": 19, "title": "On Vows \u2014 The Nazarite\u2019s Vow \u2014 The Offering of Firstfruits in the Temple", "readers": [18842], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/temple_ministry_2311_librivox/temple_19_edersheim_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2402}, {"section": 20, "title": "Appendix \u2014 Did the Lord institute His \"Supper\" on the Paschal Night?", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/temple_ministry_2311_librivox/temple_20_edersheim_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1365}]}
