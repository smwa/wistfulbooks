{"title": "Analogy of Religion to the Constitution and Course of Nature", "description": "Joseph Butler's great work is the Analogy, published in 1736, and from that day read and admired by every highly-cultivated mind. He was induced to write by a state of things very remarkable in the history of religion. Debauchery and infidelity were almost universal, not in any one class of society but in all. England had reached the culminating point of irreligion, and the firm re-establishment of Episcopacy had as yet done nothing to mend the nation\u2019s morals. Piety was deemed a mark of ignorance and vulgarity, and multitudes of those who professed it were persecuted to dungeons and death.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIt was considered settled, especially in polite circles, that Christianity, after so long a prevalence, had been found out to be an imposture. The clergy, as a body, did nothing to dispel this moral gloom, but rather increased it by their violent and scandalous conduct. In the sad language of Bishop Warburton, \u201cReligion had lost its hold on the minds of the people.\u201d\r\n<br><br>\r\nTo the Analogy no reply has ever been attempted. Extensive as is its diffusion, and great as is its acknowledged influence, infidelity has had the highest inducements to attempt to set it aside. Written for a present purpose, and most signally accomplishing it, it is yet so written as to endure, in full value, through all coming time. It is undoubtedly \u201cthe most original and the most profound work extant, in any language, on the philosophy of religion,\u201d \u201cthe most argumentative and philosophical defence of Christianity ever submitted to the world.\u201d - Summary by Preface", "duration": 42105, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "11839", "name": "Joseph Butler"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/analogy_of_religion_2210_librivox/analogyreligion_2210.jpg", "copyright_year": "1873", "genres": ["Christianity - Other"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "InTheDesert"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "InTheDesert"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "TriciaG"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "mleigh"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Editor\u2019s Introduction", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/analogy_of_religion_2210_librivox/analogyreligion_01_butler_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2042}, {"section": 2, "title": "Editor\u2019s Preface.", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/analogy_of_religion_2210_librivox/analogyreligion_02_butler_64kb.mp3", "duration": 186}, {"section": 3, "title": "Conspectus - Part 1", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/analogy_of_religion_2210_librivox/analogyreligion_03_butler_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3863}, {"section": 4, "title": "Conspectus - Part 2", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/analogy_of_religion_2210_librivox/analogyreligion_04_butler_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3217}, {"section": 5, "title": "Advertisement prefixed to the First Edition & Introduction", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/analogy_of_religion_2210_librivox/analogyreligion_05_butler_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1175}, {"section": 6, "title": "A Future Life", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/analogy_of_religion_2210_librivox/analogyreligion_06_butler_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1962}, {"section": 7, "title": "The Government of God by Rewards and Punishments", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/analogy_of_religion_2210_librivox/analogyreligion_07_butler_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1264}, {"section": 8, "title": "The Moral Government of God", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/analogy_of_religion_2210_librivox/analogyreligion_08_butler_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2719}, {"section": 9, "title": "Probation, as implying Trial, Difficulties, and Danger", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/analogy_of_religion_2210_librivox/analogyreligion_09_butler_64kb.mp3", "duration": 946}, {"section": 10, "title": "Probation, as intended for Moral Discipline and Improvement", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/analogy_of_religion_2210_librivox/analogyreligion_10_butler_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2684}, {"section": 11, "title": "The Opinion of Necessity, considered as influencing Practice", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/analogy_of_religion_2210_librivox/analogyreligion_11_butler_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1704}, {"section": 12, "title": "The Government of God, considered as a Scheme or Constitution, imperfectly comprehended", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/analogy_of_religion_2210_librivox/analogyreligion_12_butler_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1268}, {"section": 13, "title": "Conclusion", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/analogy_of_religion_2210_librivox/analogyreligion_13_butler_64kb.mp3", "duration": 731}, {"section": 14, "title": "The Importance of Christianity", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/analogy_of_religion_2210_librivox/analogyreligion_14_butler_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1982}, {"section": 15, "title": "The supposed Presumption against a Revelation, considered as miraculous", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/analogy_of_religion_2210_librivox/analogyreligion_15_butler_64kb.mp3", "duration": 796}, {"section": 16, "title": "Our Incapacity of judging, what were to be expected in a Revelation;
