{"title": "Two Short Catechisms", "description": "The first edition of these Catechisms issued from the press in 1645. Dr Owen had at that time the charge of the parish of Fordham in Essex, and laboured diligently for the instruction and benefit of his flock, by catechising from house to house. The catechisms were prepared in order that he might accomplish these parochial duties with greater efficiency and success. \u201cThe Lesser Catechism\u201d is designed for the instruction of children; \u2014 \u201cThe Greater,\u201d for the examination of persons more advanced in years. They are chiefly doctrinal. It was the intention of Owen to have followed up this little work by another Catechism on the Lord\u2019s Prayer, the Ten Commandments, and some articles of the Creed. This intention, however, was never fulfilled. These Catechisms on \u201cthe Principles of the Doctrine of Christ\u201d are included in this volume, \u2014 which embodies all the treatises of Owen directly relating to the second Person of the Trinity, \u2014 inasmuch as, according to a statement of the author in the preface, they were intended to remind his people of what he had publicly taught them, \u201cespecially concerning the person and offices of Christ.\u201d They were among the first, as the other treatises in this volume are among the last, of our author\u2019s publications; and we are thus enabled to mark the undeviating consistency with which, during all the ministrations of his public course, Owen held fast by the great doctrines of the Gospel, \u2014 \u201cthe unsearchable riches of Christ.\u201d  - Summary by Editor", "duration": 6330, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "5000", "name": " John Owen"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/two_short_catechisms_2212_librivox/twoshortcatechisms_2212.jpg", "copyright_year": "1862", "genres": ["Christianity - Other"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "InTheDesert"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "InTheDesert"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "DaveC"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "mleigh"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Prefatory Note and Epistle Dedicatory", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/two_short_catechisms_2212_librivox/twoshortcatechisms_01_owen_64kb.mp3", "duration": 361}, {"section": 2, "title": "The Lesser Catechism", "readers": [14684], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/two_short_catechisms_2212_librivox/twoshortcatechisms_02_owen_64kb.mp3", "duration": 364}, {"section": 3, "title": "The Greater Catechism Chap.
