{"title": "Flower-Patch Among the Hills", "description": "After poor health forced Klickmann to move from London to the country, she began writing a series of sketches for The Girl's Own Paper and in 1916 she published the first of a series of books based on them. Her cottage, known in her books as \"Rosemary Cottage\", had an idyllic country garden and spectacular views over the River Wye and Tintern Abbey. The book, The Flower-Patch Among the Hills,  was highly successful; a reprint was needed after two weeks. In later years, she wrote six more Flower Patch books,  the stories growing to involve her household and the local people, combining nature description, anecdote, autobiography, religion, and humour.   - Summary by Lynne Thompson", "duration": 27830, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "12751", "name": "Flora Klickmann"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/flower-patch_1801_librivox/flower_patch_hills_1801.jpg", "copyright_year": "1916", "genres": ["Animals & Nature"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Lynne T"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Lynne T"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Helen Z.
