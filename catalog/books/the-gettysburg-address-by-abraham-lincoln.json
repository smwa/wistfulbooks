{"title": "Gettysburg Address", "description": "It was a cloudy November day in 1863 when thousands gathered to hear renowned orator Edward Everett dedicate a national cemetery at the site of a pivotal battle early in July of that year. Also present to deliver \"a few appropriate remarks\" was the President of the United States, Abraham Lincoln.
