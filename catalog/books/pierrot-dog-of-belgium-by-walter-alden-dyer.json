{"title": "Pierrot, Dog Of Belgium", "description": "This 1915 novella was published as the First World War raged.  \"Belgium lies bleeding.  Across her level, lush meadows the harsh-shod hosts of war have marched. Beside her peaceful waters the sons of God have spilled each other\u2019s blood. Beneath her noble trees have raged the fires of human hate.

Her ancient cities smoke. The inspired craftsmanship of an elder day has been destroyed forever.  Belgium lies moaning.  Across the winter sea we have heard the wailing of men and women among their ruined homes\u2014honest townsfolk, simple Walloon and Flemish peasants, who had borne no malice and had done no wrong. And amid the cries of anguish and despair there have come to me the weeping of a little girl named Lisa and the voice of a faithful dog whining for his master.\"\n - Summary by Author's Introduction and David Wales", "duration": 6637, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "13343", "name": "Walter Alden Dyer"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/pierrot_dog_of_belgium_1804_librivox/pierrotdog_1804.jpg", "copyright_year": "1915", "genres": ["Family Life", "Nature & Animal Fiction", "War & Military Fiction"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "David Wales"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "David Wales"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "DaveC"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "DaveC"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Dedication and Introduction", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/pierrot_dog_of_belgium_1804_librivox/pierrotdog_00_dyer_64kb.mp3", "duration": 115}, {"section": 1, "title": "Chapter 1", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/pierrot_dog_of_belgium_1804_librivox/pierrotdog_01_dyer_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1261}, {"section": 2, "title": "Chapter 2", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/pierrot_dog_of_belgium_1804_librivox/pierrotdog_02_dyer_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1051}, {"section": 3, "title": "Chapter 3", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/pierrot_dog_of_belgium_1804_librivox/pierrotdog_03_dyer_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1193}, {"section": 4, "title": "Chapter 4", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/pierrot_dog_of_belgium_1804_librivox/pierrotdog_04_dyer_64kb.mp3", "duration": 703}, {"section": 5, "title": "Chapter 5", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/pierrot_dog_of_belgium_1804_librivox/pierrotdog_05_dyer_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1216}, {"section": 6, "title": "Chapter 6", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/pierrot_dog_of_belgium_1804_librivox/pierrotdog_06_dyer_64kb.mp3", "duration": 821}, {"section": 7, "title": "Chapter 7", "readers": [6454], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/pierrot_dog_of_belgium_1804_librivox/pierrotdog_07_dyer_64kb.mp3", "duration": 277}]}
