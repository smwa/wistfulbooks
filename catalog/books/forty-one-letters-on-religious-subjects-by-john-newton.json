{"title": "Forty-One Letters on Religious Subjects", "description": "Among the excellences which appear in all the published letters of Newton, we may mention:<br>In the first place, the grand design \u2014 the high and holy object which he seems to propose in all he speaks and writes, and which never seems absent from his mind. Another trait in Mr. N\u2019s. character as a letterwriter, and which imparts great interest as well as utility to his writings, is, his knowledge of human nature, and his close observation of men and things. There is in Newton\u2019s letters, a style and manner of composition admirably suited to the nature and objects of epistolary communications. But that which forms the most prominent feature in the charter of these letters is the uncommon degree of experimental knowledge of the power of godliness, which they every where exhibit. - Summary by E.P.
