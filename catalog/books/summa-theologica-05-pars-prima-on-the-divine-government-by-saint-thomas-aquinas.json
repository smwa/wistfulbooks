{"title": "Summa Theologica - 05 Pars Prima, On the Divine Government", "description": "The Summa Theologica (or the Summa Theologiae or simply the Summa, written 1265\u20131274) is the most famous work of Thomas Aquinas (c. 1225\u20131274) although it was never finished. It was intended as a manual for beginners and a compilation of all of the main theological teachings of that time. It summarizes the reasoning for almost all points of Christian theology in the West, which, before the Protestant Reformation, subsisted solely in the Roman Catholic Church. The Summa's topics follow a cycle: the existence of God, God's creation, Man, Man's purpose, Christ, the Sacraments, and back to God. (Summary adapted from the Wikipedia)<br><br>This is part six, the last part of the Pars Prima, consisting of the Treatise on the Divine Government.", "duration": 27066, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "1199", "name": "Saint Thomas Aquinas"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt33/summa_theologica_05_pars_prima_on_the_divine_government_1405.jpg", "copyright_year": "1300", "genres": ["Early Modern", "Christianity -
