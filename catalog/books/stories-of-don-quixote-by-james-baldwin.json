{"title": "Stories of Don Quixote : written anew for young people", "description": "The romance entitled \"The Achievements of the Ingenious Gentleman, Don Quixote de la Mancha,\" was originally written in Spanish by Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra in the 17th century. It has been read and enjoyed by men and women of the most diverse tastes and conditions. The story is so simple that every one can understand it, and yet it has in it so much wisdom that the wisest may derive pleasure from it. It touches the sense of humor in every heart. It moves to pity rather than ridicule, and to tears as well as laughter. And herein lies its chief claim to greatness, that it seems to have been written not for one country nor for one age alone, but to give delight to all mankind. \"It is our joyfullest modern book.\"<br /><br />This book is not so much an abridgment of the great book by Cervantes as it is a rewriting of some of its most interesting and captivating parts. While very much of the work has necessarily been omitted, the various adventures are so related as to form a continuous narrative; and in every way, an effort is made to give a clear idea of the manner and content of the original. Although Cervantes certainly had no thought of writing a story for children, there are many passages in Don Quixote which appeal particularly to young readers; and it is hoped that this adaptation of such passages will serve a useful purpose in awakening a desire to become further acquainted with that great world's classic.<br /><br />\nThis book is dedicated to the children who read, with the hope that they will love the hero, laugh at his adventures, excuse his faults and learn wisdom from his experience.<br /><br />(adapted from James Baldwin's introductory note to the book) (summery by Basquetteur)", "duration": 16825, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "1707", "name": "James Baldwin"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/donquixoteforyoungpeople_1610_librivox/stories_quixote_for_young_people_baldwin_1610.jpg", "copyright_year": "1910", "genres": ["Children's Fiction"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Aaron M.
