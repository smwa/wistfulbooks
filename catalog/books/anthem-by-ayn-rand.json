{"title": "Anthem", "description": "<i>Anthem</i> is a dystopic science fiction story taking place at some unspecified future date. Mankind has entered another dark age as a result of what Rand saw as the weaknesses of socialistic thinking and economics. Technological advancement is now carefully planned (when it is allowed to occur, if at all) and the concept of individuality has been eliminated (for example, the word \"I\" has disappeared from the language). As is common in her work, Rand draws a clear distinction between the \"socialist/communal\" values of equality and brotherhood and the \"productive/capitalist\" values of achievement and individuality. The story also parallels Stalinist Russia, which was currently going on at the time as the story was published.
