{"title": "Through the Magic Door", "description": "I care not how humble your bookshelf may be, nor how lowly the room which it adorns. Close the door of that room behind you, shut off with it all the cares of the outer world, plunge back into the soothing company of the great dead, and then you are through the magic portal into that fair land whither worry and vexation can follow you no more. You have left all that is vulgar and all that is sordid behind you. There stand your noble, silent comrades, waiting in their ranks. Pass your eye down their files. Choose your man. And then you have but to hold up your hand to him and away you go together into dreamland.

The personalities of the writers have faded into the thinnest shadows, as their bodies into impalpable dust, yet here are their very spirits at your command (Chapter I). <br></br>In this volume, Arthur Conan Doyle invites us into his library and discusses his favourite literature with the listener.", "duration": 17366, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "467", "name": "Sir Arthur Conan Doyle"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/librivoxcCDCoverArt35/throughmagicdoor_1601.jpg", "copyright_year": "0", "genres": ["Literary Criticism"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Crln Yldz Ksr"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Crln Yldz Ksr"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "John Burlinson"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Chapter I", "readers": [10424], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/through_the_magic_door_1601_librivox/magicdoor_01_doyle_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1276}, {"section": 2, "title": "Chapter II", "readers": [10417], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/through_the_magic_door_1601_librivox/magicdoor_02_doyle_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1636}, {"section": 3, "title": "Chapter III", "readers": [10191], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/through_the_magic_door_1601_librivox/magicdoor_03_doyle_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1236}, {"section": 4, "title": "Chapter IV", "readers": [10424], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/through_the_magic_door_1601_librivox/magicdoor_04_doyle_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1535}, {"section": 5, "title": "Chapter V", "readers": [10424], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/through_the_magic_door_1601_librivox/magicdoor_05_doyle_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1417}, {"section": 6, "title": "Chapter VI", "readers": [6311], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/through_the_magic_door_1601_librivox/magicdoor_06_doyle_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1374}, {"section": 7, "title": "Chapter VII", "readers": [10343], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/through_the_magic_door_1601_librivox/magicdoor_07_doyle_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1907}, {"section": 8, "title": "Chapter VIII", "readers": [7879], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/through_the_magic_door_1601_librivox/magicdoor_08_doyle_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2075}, {"section": 9, "title": "Chapter IX", "readers": [7228], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/through_the_magic_door_1601_librivox/magicdoor_09_doyle_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1161}, {"section": 10, "title": "Chapter X", "readers": [10420], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/through_the_magic_door_1601_librivox/magicdoor_10_doyle_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1036}, {"section": 11, "title": "Chapter XI", "readers": [6548], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/through_the_magic_door_1601_librivox/magicdoor_11_doyle_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1088}, {"section": 12, "title": "Chapter XII", "readers": [10420], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/through_the_magic_door_1601_librivox/magicdoor_12_doyle_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1625}]}
