{"title": "Memorable Thoughts of Socrates", "description": "Xenophon's best memorial of his old guide, philosopher, and friend is this work, in which Xenophon brought together in simple and direct form the views of life that had been made clear to himself by the teaching of Socrates.

He does not idealise, but he feels strongly, and he shows clearly the worth of the wisdom that touches at every point the actual conduct of the lives of men.(Summary by Craig Campbell)", "duration": 22540, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "1547", "name": " Xenophon"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/memorabilia_2008_librivox/memorablethoughts_2008.jpg", "copyright_year": "1888", "genres": ["Classics (Greek & Latin Antiquity)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Leni"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Leni"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Craig Campbell"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "INTRODUCTION", "readers": [13868], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/memorabilia_2008_librivox/memorabilia_00_xenophon_64kb.mp3", "duration": 293}, {"section": 1, "title": "BOOK 1, CHAPTER I.
