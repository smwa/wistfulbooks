{"title": "Two Musicians", "description": "LibriVox volunteers bring you 17 recordings of Two Musicians by Sarah Orne Jewett. This was the Fortnightly Poetry project for January 16, 2011.<br><br>She published her first important story in the Atlantic Monthly at age 19, and her reputation grew throughout the 1870s and 1880s. Her literary importance arises from her careful, if subdued, vignettes of country life that reflect a contemporary interest in local color rather than plot. Jewett possessed a keen descriptive gift that William Dean Howells called \"an uncommon feeling for talk \u2014 I hear your people.\" (summary by Wikipedia)", "duration": 1936, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "1685", "name": "Sarah Orne Jewett"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt28/Two_Musicians_1301.jpg", "copyright_year": "0", "genres": ["Poetry", "Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Two Musicians - Read by ALG", "readers": [4744], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/two_musicians_1101_librivox/twomusicians_jewett_alg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 102}, {"section": 2, "title": "Two Musicians - Read by CC", "readers": [4586], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/two_musicians_1101_librivox/twomusicians_jewett_cc_64kb.mp3", "duration": 101}, {"section": 3, "title": "Two Musicians - Read by CS", "readers": [92], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/two_musicians_1101_librivox/twomusicians_jewett_cs_64kb.mp3", "duration": 111}, {"section": 4, "title": "Two Musicians - Read by DL", "readers": [2911], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/two_musicians_1101_librivox/twomusicians_jewett_dl_64kb.mp3", "duration": 107}, {"section": 5, "title": "Two Musicians - Read by DRB", "readers": [94], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/two_musicians_1101_librivox/twomusicians_jewett_drb_64kb.mp3", "duration": 114}, {"section": 6, "title": "Two Musicians - Read by EEP", "readers": [2825], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/two_musicians_1101_librivox/twomusicians_jewett_eep_64kb.mp3", "duration": 133}, {"section": 7, "title": "Two Musicians - Read by GHS", "readers": [4705], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/two_musicians_1101_librivox/twomusicians_jewett_ghs_64kb.mp3", "duration": 110}, {"section": 8, "title": "Two Musicians - Read by JB", "readers": [77], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/two_musicians_1101_librivox/twomusicians_jewett_jb_64kb.mp3", "duration": 120}, {"section": 9, "title": "Two Musicians - Read by JC", "readers": [5937], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/two_musicians_1101_librivox/twomusicians_jewett_jc_64kb.mp3", "duration": 89}, {"section": 10, "title": "Two Musicians - Read by JCM", "readers": [3470], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/two_musicians_1101_librivox/twomusicians_jewett_jcm_64kb.mp3", "duration": 115}, {"section": 11, "title": "Two Musicians - Read by JM", "readers": [4697], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/two_musicians_1101_librivox/twomusicians_jewett_jm_64kb.mp3", "duration": 136}, {"section": 12, "title": "Two Musicians - Read by LAH", "readers": [1212], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/two_musicians_1101_librivox/twomusicians_jewett_lah_64kb.mp3", "duration": 117}, {"section": 13, "title": "Two Musicians - Read by LLW", "readers": [4738], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/two_musicians_1101_librivox/twomusicians_jewett_llw_64kb.mp3", "duration": 123}, {"section": 14, "title": "Two Musicians - Read by MDK", "readers": [5991], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/two_musicians_1101_librivox/twomusicians_jewett_mdk_64kb.mp3", "duration": 122}, {"section": 15, "title": "Two Musicians - Read by TG", "readers": [3157], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/two_musicians_1101_librivox/twomusicians_jewett_tg_64kb.mp3", "duration": 107}, {"section": 16, "title": "Two Musicians - Read by TK", "readers": [4610], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/two_musicians_1101_librivox/twomusicians_jewett_tk_64kb.mp3", "duration": 126}, {"section": 17, "title": "Two Musicians - Read by WT", "readers": [5694], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/two_musicians_1101_librivox/twomusicians_jewett_wt_64kb.mp3", "duration": 103}]}
