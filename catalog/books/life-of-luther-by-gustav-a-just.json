{"title": "Life of Luther", "description": "This short biography of Martin Luther, by Gustav Just, who taught at Bethlehem Evangelical Lutheran School, St. Louis, is a standard resource for students, young and old. The first five chapters give a swift moving, succinct overview of church history up to Luther\u2019s time, and the final two chapters deal with the church after Luther\u2019s death. Martin Luther is presented in a favorable, but objective light and his influence appreciated as the primary leader of the Reformation. - Summary by Larry  Wilson", "duration": 12740, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "14416", "name": "Gustav A.
