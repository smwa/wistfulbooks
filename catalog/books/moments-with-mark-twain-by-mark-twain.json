{"title": "Moments With Mark Twain", "description": "These selections from the works of Mark Twain are presented in chronological order. They include the memorable whitewashing of the fence in \"Tom Sawyer\", events preceding the Mississippi River raft journey in \"Huckleberry Finn\", a dark moment during the exchange of identities in \u201cThe Prince and the Pauper\u201d, and reflections of \u201cA Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur\u2019s Court\u201d. A critic wrote of another excerpt concerning a feud, \"...as dramatic and powerful an episode as I know in modern literature.\" Also included are comments about travel abroad, Joan of Arc, a generous helping of Twain\u2019s renowned quips, and mortality.
