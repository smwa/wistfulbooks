{"title": "Talks by Abdul Baha Given in Paris", "description": "\u201cMuch has already been written of the visit of Abdul Baha, Abbas Effendi, to Europe,\u201d writes Lady Blomfield in her Preface to Paris Talks, \u201cDuring his stay at Paris at 4, Avenue de Comoens, he gave short \u201cTalks\u201d each morning to those who crowded, eager to hear His Teaching. These listeners were of many Nationalities and types of thought, learned and unlearned, members of various religious sects, Theosophists and Agnostics, Materialists and Spiritualists, etc., etc. Abdul Baha spoke in Persian, which was translated into French. Of these \u201cTalks\u201d my two daughters, my friend and I took notes.  Many friends asked us to publish these notes in English, but we hesitated.  At length when Abdul Baha himself asked us to do so we, of course, consented\u2014in spite of our feeling that our pen is \u201ctoo weak for such high message.\u201d\u201d Paris Talks is a book transcribed from talks given by `Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1, the son and successor of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h, the Founder of the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed Faith, while in Paris. It was originally published as \u201cTalks by `Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1 Given in Paris\u201d in 1912. `Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1 did not read and authenticate the transcripts of his talks in Paris, and thus the authenticity of the talks is not known. Shoghi Effendi, the Guardian of the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed Faith, has said that while the texts are not authenticated, the compilations can still be used by Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00eds and in the future work will be done to find which parts are authentic. Lady Blomfield's copious notes are the basis of the volume. Lady Sara Louisa Blomfield [n\u00e9e Ryan] (1859-1939), who was given the title of Sit\u00e1rih Kh\u00e1num by `Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1, was the second wife to noted Victorian era architect Sir Arthur Blomfield, who died in 1899. She became a Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed in 1907 and later served on the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00eds of the British Isles for eight of its first eleven years.
