{"title": "Orphan", "description": "Many men swore that The Orphan was bad, and many swore profanely and with wonderful command of epithets because he was bad, but for obvious reasons that was as far as the majority went to show their displeasure. Those of the minority who had gone farther and who had shown their hatred by rash actions only proved their foolishness; for they had indeed gone far and would return no more. But Sheriff Jim Shields is tracking The Orphan, wanted for the murder of sheepherders, and won\u2019t stop until he brings the bad man to justice.<br>\nOften billed as the second book in Clarence Mulford\u2019s Hopalong Cassidy series, Hoppy doesn\u2019t appear in this one, but it\u2019s still as rip-roaring a western as you\u2019ll ever see. - Summary by sjmarky", "duration": 30004,
