{"title": "Extracts from a Diary Kept by the Rev. R. Burrows during Heke's War in the North, in 1845", "description": "An eye-witness account of the so-called Flagstaff War, fought between Maori warriors, led by Hone Heke, and British troops between March 1845 and January 1846 in and around the Bay of Islands. Ostensibly triggered by the cutting down of the flagstaff above Kororareka (now Russell), Heke's attack on the town was a consequence of festering grievances following the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi and annexation of New Zealand by the British Crown in 1840. The Reverend Robert Burrows had charge of the mission station and school at Waimate, inland from the Bay of Islands. His day-by-day account paints a vivid picture of the conflict, in which his chosen role was to mediate between the two sides. - Summary by Phil Benson", "duration": 12394, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "11418", "name": "Robert Burrows"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/extracts_diary_rev_burrows_hekes_war_1845_pb_1507_librivox/hekes_war_1507.jpg", "copyright_year": "1886", "genres": ["War & Military", "Memoirs"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Phil Benson"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Phil Benson"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Ann Boulais"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Algy Pug"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Preface and Introduction", "readers": [6097], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/extracts_diary_rev_burrows_hekes_war_1845_pb_1507_librivox/heke_01_burrows_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1379}, {"section": 2, "title": "3-26 March 1845", "readers": [6097], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/extracts_diary_rev_burrows_hekes_war_1845_pb_1507_librivox/heke_02_burrows_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1771}, {"section": 3, "title": "27 March - 3 May 1845", "readers": [6097], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/extracts_diary_rev_burrows_hekes_war_1845_pb_1507_librivox/heke_03_burrows_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1823}, {"section": 4, "title": "4-22 May 1845", "readers": [6097], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/extracts_diary_rev_burrows_hekes_war_1845_pb_1507_librivox/heke_04_burrows_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1513}, {"section": 5, "title": "23 May - 30 June 1845", "readers": [6097], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/extracts_diary_rev_burrows_hekes_war_1845_pb_1507_librivox/heke_05_burrows_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1689}, {"section": 6, "title": "1-14 July 1845", "readers": [6097], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/extracts_diary_rev_burrows_hekes_war_1845_pb_1507_librivox/heke_06_burrows_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1453}, {"section": 7, "title": "15-22 July 1845", "readers": [6097], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/extracts_diary_rev_burrows_hekes_war_1845_pb_1507_librivox/heke_07_burrows_64kb.mp3", "duration": 739}, {"section": 8, "title": "1 November 1845 - 4 January 1846", "readers": [6097], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/extracts_diary_rev_burrows_hekes_war_1845_pb_1507_librivox/heke_08_burrows_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1417}, {"section": 9, "title": "Conclusion and Reflections", "readers": [6097], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/extracts_diary_rev_burrows_hekes_war_1845_pb_1507_librivox/heke_09_burrows_64kb.mp3", "duration": 610}]}
