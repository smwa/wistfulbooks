{"title": "Fame and Fortune Weekly No. 19: A Rise in Life", "description": "Bob Chambers is a plucky young man who works in the Bayport Woolen Mills. He has a good rapport with nearly everyone he meets, including Ruby Norton, a young lady who also works at the Mill. One who isn't charmed by his character is the spoiled son of the Mill President, Dexter Pritchard. Dexter feels that his position in the town should give him free pick of any girl, especially Ruby. While normal life keeps Bob quite busy, the addition of a Mill strike gives Bob challenges that will test his mettle and help him to prove his worth to Rise in Life.
