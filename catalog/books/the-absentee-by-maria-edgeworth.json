{"title": "Absentee", "description": "Published in 1812, \u201cThe Absentee\u201d by Maria Edgeworth examines social injustice in 19th-century Britain.  At that time, the management of many Irish estates suffered from the absenteeism of their Anglo-Irish landlords. <br><br>We meet Lord and Lady Clonbrony. Lord Clonbrony struggles with debt, while Lady Clonbrony tries to shed her Irish connections and earn status in London\u2019s high society (known as \u201cthe ton.\u201d) Meanwhile, their son, Lord Colambre, is wary of the entanglements of that society and escapes to the family estate in Ireland, where he discovers the abuses that have arisen in the family\u2019s absence.<br><br>Maria Edgeworth was a pioneer of realism in fiction, and one of the most successful and popular novelists of her time. She offered satirical portraits of society manners and sympathetic treatment of regional life. Her work won admiration from authors such as Jane Austen and Sir Walter Scott. \u201cThe Absentee\u201d is named in the reference list \u201c1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die.\u201d - Summary by Bruce Pirie", "duration": 40869, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "2083", "name": "Maria Edgeworth"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/absentee_1803_librivox/absentee_1803.jpg", "copyright_year": "1812", "genres": ["Literary Fiction", "Published 1800 -1900"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Bruce Pirie"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Bruce Pirie"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "TriciaG"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Jennifer Dallman"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Chapter 1", "readers": [3699], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/absentee_1803_librivox/absentee_01_edgeworth_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1678}, {"section": 2, "title": "Chapter 2", "readers": [3699], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/absentee_1803_librivox/absentee_02_edgeworth_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2326}, {"section": 3, "title": "Chapter 3", "readers": [3699], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/absentee_1803_librivox/absentee_03_edgeworth_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2208}, {"section": 4, "title": "Chapter 4", "readers": [3699], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/absentee_1803_librivox/absentee_04_edgeworth_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2162}, {"section": 5, "title": "Chapter 5", "readers": [3699], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/absentee_1803_librivox/absentee_05_edgeworth_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3795}, {"section": 6, "title": "Chapter 6", "readers": [3699], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/absentee_1803_librivox/absentee_06_edgeworth_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2942}, {"section": 7, "title": "Chapter 7", "readers": [3699], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/absentee_1803_librivox/absentee_07_edgeworth_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2184}, {"section": 8, "title": "Chapter 8", "readers": [3699], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/absentee_1803_librivox/absentee_08_edgeworth_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1497}, {"section": 9, "title": "Chapter 9", "readers": [3699], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/absentee_1803_librivox/absentee_09_edgeworth_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2397}, {"section": 10, "title": "Chapter 10", "readers": [3699], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/absentee_1803_librivox/absentee_10_edgeworth_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1844}, {"section": 11, "title": "Chapter 11", "readers": [3699], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/absentee_1803_librivox/absentee_11_edgeworth_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1529}, {"section": 12, "title": "Chapter 12", "readers": [3699], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/absentee_1803_librivox/absentee_12_edgeworth_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2004}, {"section": 13, "title": "Chapter 13", "readers": [3699], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/absentee_1803_librivox/absentee_13_edgeworth_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2933}, {"section": 14, "title": "Chapter 14", "readers": [3699], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/absentee_1803_librivox/absentee_14_edgeworth_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3604}, {"section": 15, "title": "Chapter 15", "readers": [3699], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/absentee_1803_librivox/absentee_15_edgeworth_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1805}, {"section": 16, "title": "Chapter 16", "readers": [3699], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/absentee_1803_librivox/absentee_16_edgeworth_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3198}, {"section": 17, "title": "Chapter 17", "readers": [3699], "path": "http://www.archive.org/download/absentee_1803_librivox/absentee_17_edgeworth_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2763}]}
