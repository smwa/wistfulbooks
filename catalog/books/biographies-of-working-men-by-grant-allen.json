He was an atheist and pacifist and socialist, a botanist and zoologist and optimist, a chemist and physicist, a scientist of scientists, a monist, meliorist and hedonist\u2026\".  As a novelist, he is noted as a pioneer in both the detective and science fiction genres. He was born in Canada but spent the latter part of his life in England. <br><br>\"Biographies of Working Men\" is a volume containing brief biographies of seven men from working class backgrounds who went on to excel in their chosen fields.
