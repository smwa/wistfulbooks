{"title": "Heart Talks on Holiness", "description": "Samuel Logan Brengle was a commissioner in the Salvation Army. His books are known for the practicality, joyfulness and authenticity. His life was spent working with people on the streets, so his insights into the work of the Holy Spirit are relevant to everyday life. His holiness was that of the street, the kitchen, and everyday life. His stories are of men and women living their daily lives. This is the second book in his \"Holiness\" series, which focuses on the gifts of the Holy Spirit. In particular, we are encouraged to follow the example of Paul in rejoicing through suffering, and learning to serve God in all circumstances.
