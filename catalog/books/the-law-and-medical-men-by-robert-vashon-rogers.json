{"title": "Law and Medical Men", "description": "The idea that in the library of nearly every prac\u00adti\u00adtion\u00ader in the pro\u00adfes\u00adsions of both Physic and Law there has been for some time a small gap among the books, which could be filled by a little work like this now submitted, has induced the author to prepare and publish the following pages.\nWhile it is hoped that this little work will prove of use to the members of the Legal and Medical Professions, it is intended to be suggestive rather than exhaustive\u2014a primer not an encyclop\u00e6dia; and it is not expected that it will obviate the necessity for frequent conferences between physicians and lawyers whenever, in the practice of either, questions arise requiring the experience of the other.\nIn most cases the very words of the judges and reporters have been used, and if any expressions are noticed that may be deemed over strong it will be found that they are the words of others: the author\u2019s aim has been rather to act as an humble compiler and citer of cases, than to obtrude opinions or theories of his own.\nBrief chapters on Dentists and Druggists have been given because of the intimate connection between these gentlemen and the members of the medical profession.\nWith great diffidence this book is committed to the tender mercies of the critics of these two learned professions\u2014to those who can so effectually wield the pen, the tongue and the scalpel. - Summary by Robert Vashon Rogers - from the preface", "duration": 22501, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "12712", "name": "Robert Vashon Rogers"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/law_and_medicamen_1802_librivox/law_medical_men_1802.jpg", "copyright_year": "1884", "genres": ["Law"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Lynne T"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Lynne T"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Divya Sharma"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Early Practitioners and Laws", "readers": [7756], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/law_and_medicamen_1802_librivox/lawandmedicalmen_01_rogers_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1741}, {"section": 2, "title": "Fees", "readers": [7832], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/law_and_medicamen_1802_librivox/lawandmedicalmen_02_rogers_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2375}, {"section": 3, "title": "Who Should Pay the Doctor", "readers": [7756], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/law_and_medicamen_1802_librivox/lawandmedicalmen_03_rogers_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1176}, {"section": 4, "title": "Who May Practise", "readers": [11667], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/law_and_medicamen_1802_librivox/lawandmedicalmen_04_rogers_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1927}, {"section": 5, "title": "Negligence and Malpractice", "readers": [11968], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/law_and_medicamen_1802_librivox/lawandmedicalmen_05_rogers_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2729}, {"section": 6, "title": "Criminal Malpractice", "readers": [11968], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/law_and_medicamen_1802_librivox/lawandmedicalmen_06_rogers_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1192}, {"section": 7, "title": "Professional Evidence", "readers": [11968], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/law_and_medicamen_1802_librivox/lawandmedicalmen_07_rogers_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1535}, {"section": 8, "title": "Medical Experts", "readers": [11968], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/law_and_medicamen_1802_librivox/lawandmedicalmen_08_rogers_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1256}, {"section": 9, "title": "Experts in Insanity Cases", "readers": [11667], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/law_and_medicamen_1802_librivox/lawandmedicalmen_09_rogers_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1136}, {"section": 10, "title": "Defamation", "readers": [11667], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/law_and_medicamen_1802_librivox/lawandmedicalmen_10_rogers_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1167}, {"section": 11, "title": "Relations with Patients", "readers": [12008], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/law_and_medicamen_1802_librivox/lawandmedicalmen_11_rogers_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1091}, {"section": 12, "title": "Dissection and Resurrection", "readers": [11782], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/law_and_medicamen_1802_librivox/lawandmedicalmen_12_rogers_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1234}, {"section": 13, "title": "Dentists", "readers": [11968], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/law_and_medicamen_1802_librivox/lawandmedicalmen_13_rogers_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1523}, {"section": 14, "title": "Druggists", "readers": [1472], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/law_and_medicamen_1802_librivox/lawandmedicalmen_14_rogers_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1578}, {"section": 15, "title": "Partners, Goodwill, Assistants", "readers": [11667], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/law_and_medicamen_1802_librivox/lawandmedicalmen_15_rogers_64kb.mp3", "duration": 841}]}
