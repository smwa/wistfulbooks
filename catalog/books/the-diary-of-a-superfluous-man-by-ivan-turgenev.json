{"title": "Diary of a Superfluous Man", "description": "Turgenev's shy hero, Tchulkaturin, is a representative example of a Russian archetype - the \"superfluous man\", a sort of Hamlet not necessarily dignified with the title Prince: an individual of comfortable means leading a dreary existence, without purpose and led on by events which may, as in this story, engulf him. The novella takes the form of a diary started by Tchulkaturin in the shock of being diagnosed as having a terminal illness. The journal entries cover a period of two weeks, leading to his death. Tchulkaturin quickly homes in on the only significant event in his life - an unreciprocated falling-in-love leading haphazardly to a non-fatal duel that leaves him desolated and fully conscious of the futility of his inactive existence.(Summary by Martin Geeson)", "duration": 9424, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "1364", "name": "Ivan Turgenev"}], "coverArt": "https://www.archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt16/Diary_Superfluous_Man_1203.jpg", "copyright_year": "1850", "genres": ["Fictional Biographies & Memoirs"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Martin Geeson"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Martin Geeson"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Kristine Bekere"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "March 20, 18-- to March 23", "readers": [3595], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/diary_superfluous_man_0904_librivox/diaryofasuperfluousman_01_turgenev_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1869}, {"section": 2, "title": "March 24", "readers": [3595], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/diary_superfluous_man_0904_librivox/diaryofasuperfluousman_02_turgenev_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1419}, {"section": 3, "title": "March 25 and 26", "readers": [3595], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/diary_superfluous_man_0904_librivox/diaryofasuperfluousman_03_turgenev_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1757}, {"section": 4, "title": "March 27", "readers": [3595], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/diary_superfluous_man_0904_librivox/diaryofasuperfluousman_04_turgenev_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1984}, {"section": 5, "title": "March 29 to April 1", "readers": [3595], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/diary_superfluous_man_0904_librivox/diaryofasuperfluousman_05_turgenev_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2395}]}
