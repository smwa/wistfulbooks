{"title": "Bible (DRV) Apocrypha/Deuterocanon: Book of Tobit (Tobias) (Version 2)", "description": "This book tells the story of Tobit (Tobias), an Israelite, living in Nineveh after the northern tribes of Israel had been deported to Assyria in 721 B.C. Tobit remains loyal to the worship of God at the temple in Jerusalem, and he is diligent in attempting to provide proper burials for fallen Israelites. One night, he sleeps in the open and is blinded by bird droppings which fall into his eyes. At the same time in Media, a young woman, Sarah prays for death in despair, because the demon, Asmodeus, abducts and kills every man she marries. God sends the angel Raphael, disguised as a human, to assist Tobias and help set things right.
