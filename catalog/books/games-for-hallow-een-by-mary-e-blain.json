{"title": "Games for Hallow-e'en", "description": "This charming book starts with a brief history of Hallowe'en. There are sample invitations for a Halloween (or Hallowe'en) party, decorations, and then  many party games. A number of them have to do with who your future mate might be, although there are games and activities for younger children as well. All games seem to utilize common household objects, like sewing needles, pencils and paper, apples, and pumpkins. There is also a long list of riddles!  - Summary by Nan Dodge", "duration": 5429, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "13638", "name": "Mary E.
