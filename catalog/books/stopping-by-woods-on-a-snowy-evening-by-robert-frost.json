{"title": "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening", "description": "LibriVox volunteers bring you 23 recordings of Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening by Robert Frost.<br>\nThis was the Fortnightly Poetry project for January 6, 2019.   <br> ------<br>\nThe meanings of this poignant poem--which entered the Public Domain in January 2019 and is being added to the Librivox Collection ASAP--range from appreciation of a simple New Hampshire snowstorm scene to reflections on death. Whose house is in the village? What promises need keeping? The poem can be interpreted on many different levels. Quoting Wikipedia: \"At the funeral of former Canadian prime minister Pierre Trudeau, on October 3, 2000, his eldest son Justin rephrased the last stanza of this poem in his eulogy: 'The woods are lovely, dark and deep. He has kept his promises and earned his sleep.'\" ( ~ Michele Fry)", "duration": 1543, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "338", "name": "Robert Frost"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/stopping_by_woods_1901.poem_librivox/stoppingbywoods_1901.jpg", "copyright_year": "1923", "genres": ["Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Michele Fry"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "David Lawrence"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Michele Fry"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Stopping by the Woods on a Snowy Evening -
