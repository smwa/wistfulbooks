The conviction grew among us that a grim story, no matter whether it was a literary masterpiece or not, was hoodooed. \r\n<br><br>\r\nAnd then the inspiration came. Why not try to find thirteen hoodooed masterpieces by thirteen unlucky masters, and throw them upon the mercies of the public for a vote? No sooner suggested than done.
