He loves to sing, yodel, and whistle while he romps with the goats all day long on the mountains. His favorite is a young kid named M\u00e4ggerli. One day Moni comes across a serious situation where he must keep a deceitful secret in order to protect M\u00e4ggerli from being killed. Will Moni risk the life of M\u00e4ggerli and tell the truth?
