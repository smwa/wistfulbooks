{"title": "Submerged Forests", "description": "Submerged Forests, a volume in the Cambridge Manuals of Science and Literature series, is a study of the land beneath the coastal areas and estuaries of Great Britain. Clement Reid dives into the  geology, botany, zoology, and archaeology found beneath the water. \r\n\r\n\"Knowledge cannot be divided into compartments, each given a definite name and allotted to a different student. There are, and always must be, branches of knowledge in which several sciences meet or have an interest, and these are somewhat liable to be neglected. If the following pages arouse an interest in one of the by-ways of science their purpose has been fulfilled.\"\r\n - Summary by Clement Reid", "duration": 11567, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "17227", "name": "Clement Reid"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/submerged_forests_2303_librivox/submerged_forests_2303.jpg", "copyright_year": "1913", "genres": ["Nature", "Earth Sciences"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Amy Gramour"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Amy Gramour"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Amy Gramour"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Preface", "readers": [8425], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/submerged_forests_2303_librivox/submergedforests_00_reid_64kb.mp3", "duration": 57}, {"section": 1, "title": "Chapter I.
