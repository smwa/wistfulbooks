{"title": "Long Road of Woman's Memory", "description": "In this book, Jane Addams tells of a strange rumor involving Hull House, the famed settlement house founded by her in Chicago in 1889. The rumor had arisen that a \"Devil Baby\" was residing there, and for a brief period of time, many women came to Hull House hoping to see this child of legend. The women shared stories with Addams about their own often tragic lives which prompted her to write this book delving into the role of myth and painful memory in the lives of women. Addams is revered for her work at Hull House, and was a prominent sociologist, activist, and author. She was a recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize and co-founder of the American Civil Liberties Union. - Summary by Ciufi Galeazzi", "duration": 11979, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "1531", "name": "Jane Addams"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/longroadwomansmemory_2301_librivox/long_road_memory_2301.jpg", "copyright_year": "1916", "genres": ["Psychology", "Social Science (Culture & Anthropology)", "Modern (19th C)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Ciufi Galeazzi"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Ciufi Galeazzi"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "J.
