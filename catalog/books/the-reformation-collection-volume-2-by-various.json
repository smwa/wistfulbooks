{"title": "Reformation Collection Volume 2", "description": "This volume of the Reformation collection, which has a particular focus on the English Reformation, begins with William Tyndale's lively tract on the key Reformation doctrine of Justification by faith alone. Then follow two historical accounts of the reception that Reformation ideas received. Martin Luther works line by line through the popular Marian hymn Salve Regina expressing his disagreement. Christ the End of the Law is John Calvin's summary of the gospel message, written as the preface to the Geneva Bible. Calvin's Admonition against Astrology was translated into Early Modern English and has lain relatively forgotten for many years. There follow a number of documents authorised by Henry VIII and Edward VI of England showing the progress and regression of the Reformation in their reigns, including an essay against the claims of the Pope, written by Edward VI at age 12. Next come two letters relating to the English Reformation: Thomas Cromwell commenting on the reception of Tyndale's ideas by Henry VIII and Peter Martyr Vermigli writing to Heinrich Bullinger from England during the writing of the prayer book, expressing sadness that Calvin's doctrine of the sacraments had not found universal acceptance. Then come a series of short pieces by the 'Oxford Martyrs' - Thomas Cranmer, Hugh Latimer and Nicholas Ridley - carrying out the business of reforming the church. John Bradford's Preface to Melanchthon's book on prayer is \"of interest, in showing the feeling entertained in England, by the faithful worshippers, during the brief period between the decease of Edward VI. and the imprisonment of the godly Protestant Bishops and other Clergy.\" This volume of the Reformation collection ends with an eyewitness account of the final days of Martin Luther.
