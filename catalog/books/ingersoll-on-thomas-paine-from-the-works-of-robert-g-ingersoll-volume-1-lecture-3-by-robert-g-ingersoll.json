Take from our world what they have given, and all the niches would be empty, all the walls naked\u2014meaning and connection would fall from words of poetry and fiction, music would go back to common air, and all the forms of subtle and enchanting Art would lose proportion and become the unmeaning waste and shattered spoil of thoughtless Chance.\"[/i]  One of the most famous orators of his day, a contemporary and personal friend of Mark Twain and General Grant, Ingersoll's lectures on famous people herein includes: SHAKESPEARE,ROBERT BURNS, ABRAHAM LINCOLN, VOLTAIRE, WALT WHITMAN;; followed by inspiring speeches on THE GREAT INFIDELS, WHICH WAY?
