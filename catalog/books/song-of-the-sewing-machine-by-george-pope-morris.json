{"title": "Song of the Sewing-Machine", "description": "George Pope Morris  was an American editor, poet, and songwriter. \nCritic and writer Edgar Allan Poe acknowledged the popularity of Morris's songs, \"which have taken fast hold upon the popular taste, and which are deservedly celebrated\". In April 1840, Poe wrote that Morris was \"very decidedly, our best writer of songs\u2014and, in saying this, I mean to assign him a high rank as poet\". Willis wrote of Morris: \"He is just what poets would be if they sang like birds without criticism... nothing can stop a song of his\".
