{"title": "Unconditional Freeness of the Gospel", "description": "This is a work of theology which addresses a seeming contradiction in Christian thought: that love and forgiveness are freely offered to all, but they cannot be accepted without a major change in the receiver's heart. Along the way, the author explains what he believes justification to be--not a judicial act of God, but rather a description of the state of the believer. He also goes into detail on why our pride makes it difficult to accept God's love. -Summary by Devorah Allen", "duration": 12614, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "16926", "name": "Thomas Erskine"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/unconditionalfreeness_2209_librivox/unconditional_2210.jpg", "copyright_year": "1879", "genres": ["Christianity - Other"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Devorah Allen"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Devorah Allen"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Devorah Allen"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Note on the Text", "readers": [11084], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/unconditionalfreeness_2209_librivox/unconditionalfreeness_00_erskine_64kb.mp3", "duration": 90}, {"section": 1, "title": "Difficulties as to the Freedom of the Gospel", "readers": [17752], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/unconditionalfreeness_2209_librivox/unconditionalfreeness_01_erskine_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2533}, {"section": 2, "title": "Forgiveness the means not the end contemplated in the Gospel", "readers": [8677], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/unconditionalfreeness_2209_librivox/unconditionalfreeness_02_erskine_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2227}, {"section": 3, "title": "The true meaning of Justification by Faith", "readers": [8677], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/unconditionalfreeness_2209_librivox/unconditionalfreeness_03_erskine_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2298}, {"section": 4, "title": "Consideration of some passages of Scripture referring to the subject", "readers": [8677], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/unconditionalfreeness_2209_librivox/unconditionalfreeness_04_erskine_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1222}, {"section": 5, "title": "Sympathy with the mind of God", "readers": [17752], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/unconditionalfreeness_2209_librivox/unconditionalfreeness_05_erskine_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1298}, {"section": 6, "title": "Thoughts suggested by the foregoing Remarks", "readers": [16328], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/unconditionalfreeness_2209_librivox/unconditionalfreeness_06_erskine_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2100}, {"section": 7, "title": "Consistency between Present Forgiveness and Future Judgement", "readers": [17006], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/unconditionalfreeness_2209_librivox/unconditionalfreeness_07_erskine_64kb.mp3", "duration": 846}]}
