{"title": "Common Sense, version 4", "description": "In November 1774, Norfolk native Thomas Paine arrived in Philadelphia.  He came under the recommendation of Benjamin Franklin, and indeed it was Franklin's physician who nursed Paine back to health when he arrived, almost dead from typhoid fever.  It was six months before Lexington and Concord.  Paine intended for \"Common Sense\" to be published, as \"Plain Truth\", in a newspaper, but it instead was published as a pamphlet in January 1776.  It soon became the talk of the Thirteen Colonies. - Summary by Mark Leder", "duration": 2165, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "2273", "name": "Thomas Paine"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/commonsensever4_2507_librivox/commonsense4_2508.jpg", "copyright_year": "1776", "genres": ["Political Science"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Mark Leder"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Mark Leder"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Barry Eads"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "mleigh"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Introduction", "readers": [17732], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/commonsensever4_2507_librivox/commonsense_00_paine_64kb.mp3", "duration": 229}, {"section": 1, "title": "Chapter I: Of the Origin & Design of Government in general, with concise Remarks on the English Constitution", "readers": [17732], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/commonsensever4_2507_librivox/commonsense_01_paine_64kb.mp3", "duration": 922}, {"section": 2, "title": "Chapter II: Of Monarchy and Hereditary Succession", "readers": [17732], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/commonsensever4_2507_librivox/commonsense_02_paine_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1430}, {"section": 3, "title": "Chapter III: Thoughts on the present State of American Affairs", "readers": [17732], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/commonsensever4_2507_librivox/commonsense_03_paine_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2513}, {"section": 4, "title": "Chapter IV: Of the present Ability of America, with some miscellaneous Reflections", "readers": [17732], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/commonsensever4_2507_librivox/commonsense_04_paine_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1708}, {"section": 5, "title": "Appendix", "readers": [17732], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/commonsensever4_2507_librivox/commonsense_05_paine_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2165}]}
