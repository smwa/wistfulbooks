{"title": "Mowgli: All of the Mowgli Stories from the Jungle Books", "description": "In the Jungle Books, Kipling tells 9 wonderful and exciting tales about Mowgli, the human baby raised by a pack of wolves in the jungles of India.  His exploits and adventures are many and varied especially his dealing with the other animals such as his wolf mother and father and brother wolves, Baloo the wise bear who teaches him the Law of the Jungle, and in his life long battle with Shere-Kahn, the lame human killing tiger.  I have enjoyed these stories so much that I decided to take all 9 of them that are scattered throughout the first and second Jungle Books, as well as a few of his songs, and to put them into a chronological order from when he was a baby in the wolf den (Mowli's Brothers) to his teen age years when he hears the irresistable call of civilization and being with his own kind (Spring Running).      .    - Summary by Phil Chenevert", "duration": 26884, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "144", "name": "Rudyard Kipling"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/mowgli_1811_librivox/mowgli_1811.jpg", "copyright_year": "0", "genres": ["Animals & Nature"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Helen Z.
