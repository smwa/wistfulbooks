At the beginning of World War I, in 1914, she volunteered with the Red Cross Society and went to Belgium where she worked in a field hospital. Afterward she served in Russia, Armenia, and Persia. While in Persia she became ill and returned to England, where she died in July 1916. Throughout the war she had maintained a diary, which her niece edited to create this account.
