{"title": "Incredulity of Father Brown (Version 2)", "description": "These eight Father Brown mysteries depart from Chesterton\u2019s two earlier Father Brown collections \u2013 <a href=\"https://librivox.org/search?q=innocence of father brown&search_form=advanced\">The Innocence of Father Brown,</a> and <a href=\"https://librivox.org/search?q=wisdom of father brown&search_form=advanced\">The Wisdom of Father Brown</a> \u2013 in that most take place in America and/or centrally feature American characters.<br><br>\r\n\r\nFather Brown is a nondescript, shy, poorly clad and clumsy Catholic priest \u2013 and an exceptionally talented detective. He shines not despite, but because he is a humble, quiet, commonplace, Catholic priest. Because of his personal attributes he is frequently underrated and even ignored by professionals, by those with higher status or less reticent personalities. Yet he surpasses them all by his habit of observing and making rational sense of the ordinary, by what is, to most people, the unseen. He does not neglect science and experimentation, but he draws heavily on the habit of introspection and on the psychological insights he has gained by working with the poor, the underclass, and by hearing their confessions and witnessing both true penitence and true evil.<br><br>\r\n\r\nHe turns upside-down the approach of Sherlock Holmes, which focuses on the facts that allow for theoretical deductions. His detective methods mirror his personality, as his intuition transforms commonplace, apparently unimportant facts into ordinary, prosaic explanations that explain otherwise baffling mysteries.<br>\r\n - Summary by Kirsten Wever", "duration": 31978, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "426", "name": "G.
