{"title": "Bible (KJV) 00: Preface", "description": "The preface to the KJV Bible is fitting to read, as it reminds contemporary readers of the transitory nature of all Bible translations. The preface is a necessary, though often unread, gift from the translators to readers of the KJV. If you read this preface, or hear it, you will be able to unravel many false teachings associated with the exclusive use of one version. It not only defends the work of the translators, it defends the necessity of a translation for the time and place, to speak in a voice understandable to a contemporary audience. Listen to this preface for a greater appreciation of the work of these fine men.
