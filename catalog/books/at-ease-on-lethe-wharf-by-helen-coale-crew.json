{"title": "At Ease on Lethe Wharf", "description": "LibriVox volunteers bring you 18 recordings of <em>At Ease on Lethe Wharf</em>, by Helen Coale Crew. This was the Weekly Poetry project for April 14th, 2013.<br /><br />Helen Coale Crew was an American poet and novelist. Her touching evocation of forgetfulness comes from the Chicago Anthology, published in 1916. Lethe refers to the first river that souls bound for the Elysian Fields, the Heaven of the ancient Greeks, had to cross. Drinking from the river was said to have the effect of expunging all memories.", "duration": 1624, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "9733", "name": "Helen Coale Crew"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt30/ease_lethe_wharf_1304.jpg", "copyright_year": "1916", "genres": ["Poetry", "Multi-version (Weekly and Fortnightly poetry)"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Algy Pug"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Ruth Golding"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Algy Pug"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "At Ease on Lethe Wharf - Read by ALP", "readers": [4705], "path": "https://archive.org/download/at_ease_lethe_1304_librivox/ateaseonlethewharf_crew_alp_64kb.mp3", "duration": 91}, {"section": 2, "title": "At Ease on Lethe Wharf - Read by AS", "readers": [8242], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/at_ease_lethe_1304_librivox/ateaseonlethewharf_crew_as_64kb.mp3", "duration": 93}, {"section": 3, "title": "At Ease on Lethe Wharf - Read by CB", "readers": [6173], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/at_ease_lethe_1304_librivox/ateaseonlethewharf_crew_cb_64kb.mp3", "duration": 110}, {"section": 4, "title": "At Ease on Lethe Wharf - Read by DD", "readers": [7640], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/at_ease_lethe_1304_librivox/ateaseonlethewharf_crew_dd_64kb.mp3", "duration": 94}, {"section": 5, "title": "At Ease on Lethe Wharf Read by DL", "readers": [2911], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/at_ease_lethe_1304_librivox/ateaseonlethewharf_crew_dl_64kb.mp3", "duration": 87}, {"section": 6, "title": "At Ease on Lethe Wharf - Read by EEP", "readers": [2825], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/at_ease_lethe_1304_librivox/ateaseonlethewharf_crew_eep_64kb.mp3", "duration": 101}, {"section": 7, "title": "At Ease on Lethe Wharf - Read by ES", "readers": [7297], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/at_ease_lethe_1304_librivox/ateaseonlethewharf_crew_es_64kb.mp3", "duration": 70}, {"section": 8, "title": "At Ease on Lethe Wharf - Read by FS", "readers": [6735], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/at_ease_lethe_1304_librivox/ateaseonlethewharf_crew_fs_64kb.mp3", "duration": 88}, {"section": 9, "title": "At Ease on Lethe Wharf - Read by GB", "readers": [4969], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/at_ease_lethe_1304_librivox/ateaseonlethewharf_crew_gb_64kb.mp3", "duration": 90}, {"section": 10, "title": "At Ease on Lethe Wharf - Read by HNB", "readers": [8315], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/at_ease_lethe_1304_librivox/ateaseonlethewharf_crew_hnb_64kb.mp3", "duration": 84}, {"section": 11, "title": "At Ease on Lethe Wharf - Read by JCM", "readers": [3470], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/at_ease_lethe_1304_librivox/ateaseonlethewharf_crew_jcm_64kb.mp3", "duration": 83}, {"section": 12, "title": "At Ease on Lethe Wharf - Read by JHJ", "readers": [8301], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/at_ease_lethe_1304_librivox/ateaseonlethewharf_crew_jhj_64kb.mp3", "duration": 92}, {"section": 13, "title": "At East on Lethe Wharf - Read by JM", "readers": [4697], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/at_ease_lethe_1304_librivox/ateaseonlethewharf_crew_jm2_64kb.mp3", "duration": 92}, {"section": 14, "title": "At Ease on Lethe Wharf - Read by LAH", "readers": [1212], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/at_ease_lethe_1304_librivox/ateaseonlethewharf_crew_lah_64kb.mp3", "duration": 85}, {"section": 15, "title": "At Ease on Lethe Wharf - Read by LB", "readers": [7240], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/at_ease_lethe_1304_librivox/ateaseonlethewharf_crew_lb_64kb.mp3", "duration": 98}, {"section": 16, "title": "At Ease on Lethe Wharf - Read by MML", "readers": [8298], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/at_ease_lethe_1304_librivox/ateaseonlethewharf_crew_mml_64kb.mp3", "duration": 95}, {"section": 17, "title": "At Ease on Lethe Wharf - Read by RN", "readers": [3465], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/at_ease_lethe_1304_librivox/ateaseonlethewharf_crew_rn_64kb.mp3", "duration": 95}, {"section": 18, "title": "At Ease on Lethe Wharf - Read by TS", "readers": [7608], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/at_ease_lethe_1304_librivox/ateaseonlethewharf_crew_ts_64kb.mp3", "duration": 76}]}
