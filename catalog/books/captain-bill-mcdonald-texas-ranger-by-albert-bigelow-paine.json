{"title": "Captain Bill McDonald, Texas Ranger: A Story of Frontier Reform", "description": "\"William Jesse \"Bill\" McDonald (1852 - 1918) in the 1880s served as a deputy sheriff in Wood County. After moving to Hardeman County, he served as deputy sheriff, special Ranger, and U. S. Deputy Marshal of the Northern District of Texas and the Southern District of Kansas.. . . .In 1891 McDonald was selected to replace S. A. McMurry as Captain of Company B, Frontier Battalion. He served as a Ranger captain until 1907. Capt. McDonald and his company took part in a number of celebrated cases including the Fitzsimmons-Maher prize fight, the Wichita Falls bank robbery, the Reese-Townsend feud, and the Brownsville Raid of 1906. His handling of the troops of the 25th U.S. Infantry during this last incident made him known as \"a man who would charge hell with a bucket of water.\" He had a reputation as a gunman that rested upon his his marksmanship, and his ability to use his weapons to intimidate his opponents. \u2026 In 1905, McDonald served as bodyguard to President Theodore Roosevelt. In 1907, Governor Campbell made him a state revenue agent. He again fulfilled the role of bodyguard in 1912 for a visit by Woodrow Wilson. Later Wilson appointed him U. S. Marshal for the Northern District of Texas.\" -- from Chapter 1 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNote: This book racially offensive words which were part of the vocabulary of the time.
