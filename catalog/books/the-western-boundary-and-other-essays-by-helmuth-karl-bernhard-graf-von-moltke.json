The essay came in the wake of calls the previous year by Adolphe Thiers\u2014at the time Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of France\u2014to annex the left bank of the Rhine in \u2018satisfaction\u2019 after France\u2019s capitulation to Britain and Russia over the \u2018Oriental question\u2019. Helmuth von Moltke here examines Franco-German relations from the fall of the Roman Empire to undercut narratives then emanating from France. \r\n<br><br>\r\n<i>Holland and Belgium in their Mutual Relations</i> was published in a brochure format in 1830. It concerns the situation in Belgium kicked off by the French Revolution of that year.\r\n<br><br>\r\n<i>Considerations in the Choice of Railway Routes</i> from 1843 is an early study of railways through a technical and economic set of lenses. Railways would go on to be a vital cornerstone of German mobilization and strategic planning\u2014and an important component of his own military thought.\r\n<br><br>\r\nMoltke first became interested in railways in 1841 when the Berlin\u2013Hamburg railway extended him the offer of a seat on the board of directors. He left the board in 1844 but would continue to dwell on the subject for decades to come.\r\n - Summary by Alister", "duration": 18541, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "17443", "name": "Helmuth Karl Bernhard Graf von Moltke"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/westernboundaryotheressays_2412_librivox/westernboundary_2412.jpg", "copyright_year": "1893", "genres": ["War & Military", "Modern (19th C)", "Transportation"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "Alister"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Alister"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Ann Boulais"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "gracesilvey"}], "sections": [{"section": 1, "title": "Preface to the Western Boundary", "readers": [17571], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/westernboundaryotheressays_2412_librivox/westernboundary_01_moltke_64kb.mp3", "duration": 139}, {"section": 2, "title": "The Western Boundary, Part 1", "readers": [17571], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/westernboundaryotheressays_2412_librivox/westernboundary_02_moltke_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2542}, {"section": 3, "title": "The Western Boundary, Part 2", "readers": [17571], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/westernboundaryotheressays_2412_librivox/westernboundary_03_moltke_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3011}, {"section": 4, "title": "The Western Boundary, Part 3", "readers": [17571], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/westernboundaryotheressays_2412_librivox/westernboundary_04_moltke_64kb.mp3", "duration": 990}, {"section": 5, "title": "Preface to Holland and Belgium in their Mutual Relations", "readers": [17571], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/westernboundaryotheressays_2412_librivox/westernboundary_05_moltke_64kb.mp3", "duration": 241}, {"section": 6, "title": "Holland and Belgium in their Mutual Relations, Part 1", "readers": [17571], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/westernboundaryotheressays_2412_librivox/westernboundary_06_moltke_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1798}, {"section": 7, "title": "Holland and Belgium in their Mutual Relations, Part 2", "readers": [17571], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/westernboundaryotheressays_2412_librivox/westernboundary_07_moltke_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2338}, {"section": 8, "title": "Holland and Belgium in their Mutual Relations, Part 3", "readers": [17571], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/westernboundaryotheressays_2412_librivox/westernboundary_08_moltke_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2347}, {"section": 9, "title": "Preface to Considerations in the Choice of Railway Routes", "readers": [17571], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/westernboundaryotheressays_2412_librivox/westernboundary_09_moltke_64kb.mp3", "duration": 617}, {"section": 10, "title": "Considerations in the Choice of Railway Routes, Part 1", "readers": [17571], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/westernboundaryotheressays_2412_librivox/westernboundary_10_moltke_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1681}, {"section": 11, "title": "Considerations in the Choice of Railway Routes, Part 2", "readers": [17571], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/westernboundaryotheressays_2412_librivox/westernboundary_11_moltke_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2837}]}
