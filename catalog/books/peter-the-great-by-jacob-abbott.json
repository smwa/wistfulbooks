{"title": "Peter the Great", "description": "There are very few persons who have not heard of the fame of Peter the Great, the founder, as he is generally regarded by mankind, of Russian civilization. The celebrity, however, of the great Muscovite sovereign among young persons is due in a great measure to the circumstance of his having repaired personally to Holland, in the course of his efforts to introduce the industrial arts among his people, in order to study himself the art and mystery of shipbuilding, and of his having worked with his own hands in a ship-yard there. The little shop where Peter pursued these practical studies still stands in Saardam, a ship-building town not far from Amsterdam. The building is of wood, and is now much decayed; but, to preserve it from farther injury, it has been encased in a somewhat larger building of brick, and it is visited annually by great numbers of curious travelers.<br></br>The whole history of Peter, as might be expected from the indications of character developed by this incident, forms a narrative that is full of interest and instruction for all.\n(from the Preface of <i>Peter the Great</i>)", "duration": 25356, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "699", "name": "Jacob Abbott"}], "coverArt": "https://www.archive.org/download/LibrivoxCdCoverArt7/peter_the_great_1012.jpg", "copyright_year": "1902", "genres": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Alex Buie"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "J.
