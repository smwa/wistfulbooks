{"title": "Different Girls", "description": "This is a collection of the best short stories about girls published in Harper's Magazine from 1895 to 1906. The girls in these stories are not the typical 'girl' from late 19th century novels. They are..different. They are actually [gasp] real people! Not necessarily shy, not necessarily bold, not necessarily well read and mostly, not waiting around to be rescued and most definitely not heroines but all of them are completely human. These stories by some of the best authors of the time are about girls in a different light, they are all American girls (except for one, Katie's Sister Josephene), some Irish-American, some older, some younger but all seeing life from a girl's perspective and with a girl's zest for life. So let's go back a hundred years to see what 'different' girls were like then.   - Summary by Phil chenevert", "duration": 22322, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "830", "name": "Elizabeth Jordan"}, {"id": "3179", "name": "Richard le Gallienne"}], "coverArt": "https://archive.org/download/different_girls_1704_librivox/differentgirls_1705.jpg", "copyright_year": "1906", "genres": ["Anthologies"], "supporters": [{"role": "Read by", "name": "LibriVox Volunteers"}, {"role": "Book Coordinator", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}, {"role": "Meta Coordinator", "name": "Phil Chenevert"}, {"role": "Proof Listener", "name": "Mark Chulsky"}], "sections": [{"section": 0, "title": "Introduction", "readers": [10244], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/different_girls_1704_librivox/differentgirls_00_various_64kb.mp3", "duration": 200}, {"section": 1, "title": "The Little Joys of Margaret", "readers": [11007], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/different_girls_1704_librivox/differentgirls_01_various_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1519}, {"section": 2, "title": "Kittie's Sister Josephine", "readers": [11007], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/different_girls_1704_librivox/differentgirls_02_various_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1817}, {"section": 3, "title": "The Wizard's Touch", "readers": [11507], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/different_girls_1704_librivox/differentgirls_03_various_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1874}, {"section": 4, "title": "The Bitter Cup", "readers": [10463], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/different_girls_1704_librivox/differentgirls_04_various_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1203}, {"section": 5, "title": "His Sister", "readers": [11007], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/different_girls_1704_librivox/differentgirls_05_various_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3192}, {"section": 6, "title": "The Perfect Year", "readers": [11417], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/different_girls_1704_librivox/differentgirls_06_various_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1098}, {"section": 7, "title": "Editha", "readers": [11007], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/different_girls_1704_librivox/differentgirls_07_various_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2328}, {"section": 8, "title": "The Stout Miss Hopkins's Bicycle", "readers": [11007], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/different_girls_1704_librivox/differentgirls_08_various_64kb.mp3", "duration": 3183}, {"section": 9, "title": "The Marrying of Esther", "readers": [1649], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/different_girls_1704_librivox/differentgirls_09_various_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1945}, {"section": 10, "title": "Cordelia's Night of Romance", "readers": [11007], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/different_girls_1704_librivox/differentgirls_10_various_64kb.mp3", "duration": 1808}, {"section": 11, "title": "The Prize-Fund Beneficiary", "readers": [11007], "path": "https://www.archive.org/download/different_girls_1704_librivox/differentgirls_11_various_64kb.mp3", "duration": 2155}]}
