{"title": "Way of Peace (version 3)", "description": "\u2018The Way of Peace\u2019 is the second part of James Allen\u2019s first published work titled \u2018From Poverty to Power\u2019 alternatively titled \u2018The Realization of Prosperity and Peace\u2019 (1901).\r\n<br></br>\r\nWhere part one focused more on the power an individual possesses over their circumstances and environment, part two dives deeper into that pathway which leads to what every soul inwardly seeks. The simplicity of these teachings make them accessible to everyone and invaluable to those with an interest in practical transcendentalism.\r\n<br></br>\r\nFocusing on meditation and ascension without favouritism toward any school of thought or religion. \u2018The Way of Peace\u2019 explores and explains divine truths by drawing on examples from nature.\r\n<br></br>\r\nCan be read on its own or as an extension to part one (titled \u2018The Path to Prosperity\u2019), this is a powerful volume which invites us to prove itself true through our own experiences and reflection.\r\n<br></br>\r\nWritten to appeal to readers with an interest in attaining a higher state of consciousness, its timeless wisdom provides a pathway, in plain English, without the confusion of subjective narratives.
