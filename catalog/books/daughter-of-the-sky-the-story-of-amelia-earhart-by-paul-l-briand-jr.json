{"title": "Daughter of the Sky: The Story of Amelia Earhart", "description": "This is an engaging biography of the renowned aviator. In his introduction, Briand says, \" Amelia Earhart was one of America\u2019s great heroines; her life was in many ways unique. She was one of a kind, and the fabric of her life was woven of strands that are rarely produced: she had an insatiable curiosity about everything in life\u2014ideas, books, people, places, mechanical things; she loved all kinds of sports and games, especially those \u201conly for boys\u201d; she fidgeted with an implacable unrest to experiment, to try new things; she teemed with a zest for living, paradoxically entwined with a gnawing and pervasive longing to be alone; and, finally, she brooded with a fatalism toward death, which she met with a tremendous will to live.\" - Summary by Ciufi Galeazzi", "duration": 28644, "language": "English", "authors": [{"id": "17473", "name": "Paul L.
