{"title": "Dream", "description": "LibriVox volunteers bring you 17 recordings of The Dream by John Donne. This was the Fortnightly Poetry project for July 17, 2011.<br><br>John Donne was an English poet, satirist, lawyer, and priest who is considered a prominent representative of the metaphysical poets of the period. His works are notable for their mimetic and sensual style and include sonnets, love poetry, religious poems,  Latin translations, epigrams, elegies, songs, satires and sermons. His poetry is noted for its vibrancy of language and inventiveness of metaphor, especially as compared to that of his contemporaries.
